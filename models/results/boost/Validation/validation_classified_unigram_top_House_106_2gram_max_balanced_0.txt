agreement providing for the withdrawal of yugoslavian troops from kosovo and the deployment of international peacekeeping forces it is vital that we not forget the american troops who continue to languish in kosovo or those in bosnia and other fellow citizens scattered throughout the world on various deployments we should also consider the cost of these deployments both in dollars and in reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian government indicate that 93 percent of the population of kosovo is ethnic albanians now and 5 percent serbs in essence american troons rre in kosovo to protect the serbs from an angry majority this makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the kosovo operation costs 3 billion last year and the estimate for fy 2000 is about 2 billion our peacekeeping operation in the balkans is approaching 20 billion in total expenses in reading a heritage foundation report on this issue i discovered that the pentagon believes that it missed its procurement targets for the past 5 years because of unexpected costs associated with the military operations in kosovo and bosnia this means that we have not met our goals for modernizing our weaponry because of our peacekeeping operations in the balkans by making bosnia and kosovo safer for their citizens we have made america less safe for our citizens is that really the policy results this administration is seeking congress must take steps to ensure that americas national security interests are

regime to conquer taiwan by force and then he threatened the united states we will not allow any foreign force to create or support taiwanese independence i have in my possession pentagon documents detailing the clinton administrations exchange program between the united states and communist china it is a military exchange program this program of military exchanges has in effect assisted the communist chinese air force in improving its capabilities to conduct bombing raids on taiwan the may 1999 air force exchange and this was an exchange in may of 1999 this year introduced the communist chinese and these are military leaders in the communist chinese military to our most advanced air force capabilities this may eventually cause the death of americans serving in any unitedstates air or naval forces that would attempt to defend taiwan against communist attack this is mind boggling i pray that those people who are listening to this or reading it in the congressional record or my colleagues will please pay attention we are talking about training communist chinese military people in ways that will result in the death of thousands if not tens of thousands of american military personnel it is outrageous it is incredible what can you say what can we do to draw attention to this absolute outrage the chinese communist peoples liberation air force and government air traffic control delegation visited the united states between may 9 and may 20 of this year air traffic control certainly sounds harmless the pentagon documents used to brief these chinese visitors show that they observed or participated in advanced combat air force exercises with the unitedstates 389th fighter squadron at luke air force base in arizona they also observed fighter bomber operations at edwards air force base test center in california at these exercises they experienced the real or simulated flights of bombing runs and strafing runs by our most sophisticated military aircraft especially useful for the communist chinese in their potential attack by the communist chinese on taiwan was the briefing they got and these dod documents verify this that they were shown how the military can use civilian airfields to conduct military operations what we see by these dod documents is that our government our defense department showed the communist chinese how we would use our radar systems for air traffic control of fighter bombers at remote airfields we showed the communists how to use awacs in coordinating bombing campaigns we showed the communists how we coordinate our awacs with inflight refueling for longrange missions earlier in this session when i discovered this military exchange program and made it public the congress appealed to the defense department and passed legislation to end military exchanges that would benefit the warfighting skills of the chinese military these dod documents prove that the pentagon has ignored the will of congress instead they

first week he got his drivers license and he was 16 in waco texas and my parents had one good car and one kind of second car and so john got to drive the second car it was a ford fairlane the first week he got his drivers license he was driving down 25th street in waco and at that time there was a movie theater called the 25th street theater and the young lady who was in the ticket box the box office was a friend of his from high school and john drove by and trying to do some fancy maneuver with the car and wave at her he hit three cars and totaled two of them and drove a car up into the front entrance of the local newspaper i happened to be a senior in college at the time and was home with some of my old high school football buddies and when he called home he did not ask for my father he asked for me he said joe you are going to have to come down and help me out a little bit so my buddies and i we got in the car and they all knew him as little joe because when we were in high school john was not more than 42 feet tall so he had grown up by the time i got to college we went down to see him and he was standing outside looking at the car and not too knowing what to do after we got through laughing about it we said well john you are going to have to call dad there is no way to get around it so he did and of course my father came down and he was not too happy about it he did not laugh a bit one of my memories of my little brother in high school was standing there looking so forlorn with the girl he was trying to impress in the box office at the movie theater laughing and all of my friends laughing and my father just absolutely chewing his tail out for having this happen the first time he had his drivers license or in fact the first time he had his drivers license and drove by himself totalling two cars and sen~ling another car into the front office of the local newspaper which obviously the next day ran a very uncomplimentary story about larry bartons youngest son i can also remember in 1984 when i decided to run for congress now today we read routinely about million dollar campaigns and all these highpriced consultants and tv ads but in the sixth district of texas in 1984 in the republican primary there was not any of that it was an absolutely familyoriented grass roots campaign by then john was an attorney who was living down in corpus christi texas i convinced him to come to ennis and help run my campaign so he went from a beachfront apartment in corpus christi texas down on the gulf coast where there were sea breezes and just a really nice lifestyle to sleeping on a cot in the kitchen of my home my motherinlaw and fatherinlaw slept on a pallet out in the garage my campaign driver slept on the couch my sister slept in one room a bedroom with my oldest daughter alison jan and i slept in what was called the master bedroom which meant it had an extra foot of space with christine our youngest daughter in the crib john would routinely be woken up in the morning by my 2yearold kristin looking into his eyes tickling him we offered him a great salary i think of 600 a month but what that really meant was when he had a car note come due or a college loan payment come due my sister jan who was a campaign treasurer would say you bring me the bill and i will pay the bill and he did an outstanding job in that campaign i got into a runoff and in the runoff i lost the runoff by i want to say 9 votes out of about 10 000 votes cast to seek a recount you had to file a legal document in every county court and there were 14 counties so my brother who was the only attorney on the payroll of the campaign had to file those documents he prepared the legal briefs within 3 days he went to all 14 county courthouses in the sixth district of texas and filed the legal paperwork to request a hand count recount of every ballot that had been counted had been cast in the primary runoff in that runoff he coordinated some pro bono attorneys who represented me at each recount and we went from losing the election by 9 votes to winning the election by 10 votes to this day i think if it had not been for my little brother that might not have happened i can also remember when he came to see me about 4 years ago by now he was married and had two children and was practicing law in fort worth texas he said joe i have decided that i wanted to run for office i said john have you not seen enough of me and what i have done to convince you that there are better ways to make a living than trying to get elected and he said yes i have but i do not want to run for congress i want to run for district judge the county he was living in is the fourth largest county in texas so that meant that he had to run countywide in a county that has 1 million people i said john how much money do you have to run for office he said i dont have any money i said okay what kind of an organization do you have he said i dont have any organization i said okay have you done something notable in the county in a public way that your name is on the lips of all the voters he said i have not done that i said well why do you think you can win a district judgeship in tarrant county texas he said well if you can run for congress and win i know i can run for district judge and win i did not have an answer to that so i said okay so when he announced for district judge he announced in a seat for a position for a courtship that he did not think he would have any opposition in i felt pretty confident that he would win an uncontested election but that did not work out one of the biggest law firms in fort worth decide that they had an attorney that they wanted to run for that same position so an excellent attorney in fort worth who had an excellent reputation was well known in the legal community had impeccable credentials decided to run against john of course when that was announced we were not real happy about that but to make a long story short just like in my campaign in 1984 for congress where my mother and my father and my brother and my sister and my grandmother my aunt and uncle all the barton family and the bice family and the winslow family were out campaigning those same family members trekked up to tarrant county texas and we got on the telephones and we stood in front of the polling places and we handed out cards and we did all the grass roots things and again john was outspent but when the dust had cleared he won countywide he got the largest number of votes for any countywide office on the ballot and he almost got more votes than i did that kind of upset me a little bit but he has gone on to do an outstanding job in fact he has done such an outstanding job that this year he is up for reelection and he has no opponent when i go to tarrant county which is about half of my congressional district more and more now i am introduced as judge bartons brother which is a real tribute to him i really rise this

campaign against yugoslav forces next month will mark the 1year anniversary of the agreement providing for the withdrawal of yugoslavian troops from kosovo and the deployment of international peacekeeping forces it is vital that we not forget the american troops who continue to languish in kosovo or those in bosnia and other fellow citizens scattered throughout the world on various deployments we should also consider the cost of these deployments both in dollars and in reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian government indicate that 93 percent of the population of kosovo is ethnic albanians now and 5 percent serbs in essence american troons rre in kosovo to protect the serbs from an angry majority this makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the kosovo operation costs 3 billion last year and the estimate for fy 2000 is about 2 billion our peacekeeping operation in the balkans is approaching 20 billion in total expenses in reading a heritage foundation report on this issue i discovered that the pentagon believes that it missed its procurement targets for the past 5 years because of unexpected costs associated with the military operations in kosovo and bosnia this means that we have not met our goals for modernizing our weaponry because of our peacekeeping operations in the balkans by making bosnia and kosovo safer for their citizens we have made america less safe for our citizens is that really the policy results this administration is seeking congress must take steps to ensure that americas national security interests are paramount in conducting our military and diplomatic missions"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 days ago the unitedstates secretary of defense william cohen told reporters that he hopes the unitedstates military will resume contacts with the communist chinese military at the very same time that secretary cohen was speaking in shanghai chinese dictator jiang zemin was speaking to a gathering of elite unitedstates corporate chairmen who were in china to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the communist takeover of the mainland of china jiang zemin blatantly renewed threats by the communist regime to conquer taiwan by force and then he threatened the united states we will not allow any foreign force to create or support taiwanese independence i have in my possession pentagon documents detailing the clinton administrations exchange program between the united states and communist china it is a military exchange program this program of military exchanges has in effect assisted the communist chinese air force in improving its capabilities to conduct bombing raids on taiwan the may 1999 air force exchange and this was an exchange in may of 1999 this year introduced the communist chinese and these are military leaders in the communist chinese military to our most advanced air force capabilities this may eventually cause the death of americans serving in any unitedstates air or naval forces that would attempt to defend taiwan against communist attack this is mind boggling i pray that those people who are listening to this or reading it in the congressional record or my colleagues will please pay attention we are talking about training communist chinese military people in ways that will result in the death of thousands if not tens of thousands of american military personnel it is outrageous it is incredible what can you say what can we do to draw attention to this absolute outrage the chinese communist peoples liberation air force and government air traffic control delegation visited the united states between may 9 and may 20 of this year air traffic control certainly sounds harmless the pentagon documents used to brief these chinese visitors show that they observed or participated in advanced combat air force exercises with the unitedstates 389th fighter squadron at luke air force base in arizona they also observed fighter bomber operations at edwards air force base test center in california at these exercises they experienced the real or simulated flights of bombing runs and strafing runs by our most sophisticated military aircraft especially useful for the communist chinese in their potential attack by the communist chinese on taiwan was the briefing they got and these dod documents verify this that they were shown how the military can use civilian airfields to conduct military operations what we see by these dod documents is that our government our defense department showed the communist chinese how we would use our radar systems for air traffic control of fighter bombers at remote airfields we showed the communists how to use awacs in coordinating bombing campaigns we showed the communists how we coordinate our awacs with inflight refueling for longrange missions earlier in this session when i discovered this military exchange program and made it public the congress appealed to the defense department and passed legislation to end military exchanges that would benefit the warfighting skills of the chinese military these dod documents prove that the pentagon has ignored the will of congress instead they have not only jeopardized the 24 million people who live on democratic taiwan but this administration is in effect teaching the communist chinese how to improve their ability to kill americas defenders again this is bizarre it is almost surrealistic i beg my colleagues to pay attention to this i beg the administration to come to their senses quit trying to treat the worlds worst human rights abuser a regime that constantly reminds us that they do not believe in anything that america believes in hates everything america stands for i beg them to quit trying to call these people our strategic partners and training them how to do their military i stand ready to give my colleagues all of these

weary feet in the first half of this century montgomery alabama represented the worst segregation had to offer daily life in montgomery included such insulting facts of life as blacks only elevators segregated lunch counters and jim crow laws which relegated africanamericans to secondclass status and on public buses the first four rows of seats were reserved for whites and usually remained empty when there were not enough whites to fill them the back section of course was always very crowded was reserved for blacks one december evening after a long day at work rosa parks stepped on a bus for the ride home to a restful night of sleep parks was sitting in the middle section of the bus when a white man boarded the bus and demanded that she move because the white section of the bus was full parks very tired from a long day working as a seamstress quietly refused to move when told by the bus driver that the police were about to be called parks said go ahead and call them the police came and they arrested this gentle middleaged women for refusing to move to the back of the bus it was this stand against racism and prejudice in montgomery alabama that has led many to refer to rosa parks as the mother of the civil rights movement because of the courage of individuals like rosa parks the ugly head of segregation was eventually severed and the violence and indignities that once faced
