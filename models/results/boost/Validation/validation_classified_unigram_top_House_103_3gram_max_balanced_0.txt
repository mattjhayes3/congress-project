example less than a year ago we passed the north american freetrade agreement in that we agreed to the general principle of national treatment in financial services but throughout the agreement there are exceptions to the principle of free trade in a complex trade agreement it is possible that unitedstates negotiators would agree to provide some exceptions or reservations for our trading partner in the area of banking in exchange for unitedstates exceptions in another area i do not believe that the national treatment review authority provided to the treasury department in this bill should override or call into question those negotiated agreements in some cases the united states may have agreed to less than full national treatment in other cases if a trade agreement provides for full national treatment in banking servides and that treatment is not provided the unitedstates government should first use the dispute resolution process contained in the agreement not resort to unilateral action again to use nafta as an example if canada or mexico were not meeting their commitments in the area of banking services the appropriate course of action would be to first initiate action through the nafta dispute resolution process i yield to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts chairman of the subcommittee"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a frontpage article in the new york times last week ridiculed those of us seeking to initiate some reforms in washington they labeled us goodygoody chic it printed wise sayings by veteran members quoted beltway insider comments about nerds

theory but not in practice we would rather sound good than act right because the house leadership wants a vote on the health care plan they have pushed back the summer recess until the third week of august house leaders may not have schoolaged children but dozens of other members of congress do since school activities resume in august that means very short or no summer family vacations if we are going to vote on health care let us set aside artificial deadlines give congress time to considerthe legislatlon and the american peo pie time to find out what is in it a good health care plan next month is better than a bad plan this month honoring the scheduled 2week august recess and giving health care the scrutiny it deserves will do more for family health than hasty debate and rushed votes who knows if congress practiced what it preached about families maybe it would get a cleaner bill of health from the american people"]]}
