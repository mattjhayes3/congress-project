the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on

demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists

present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely

going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman

armies and in 1920 concluded a peace treaty with the soviet union unfortunately the signing of the notorious stalinhitler pact of august 23 1939 offered to nazi germany a welcome pretense for starting world war ii and allowed parts of eastern europe including the three baltic nationsestonia latvia and lithuaniato become part of soviet russias socalled sphere of influence consequently stalin received a free hand to forcibly annex these three independent baltic countries which remain illegally occupied by the unitedstatess r to this day soon after the conclusion of this pact estonia signed on september 28 1930 under military threat and without the possibility of any help from aboard a pact of mutual assistance with the soviet union during the period of 20 years which the estonian people enjoyed their independence they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists estonia is economically exploited by the moscow legime those who dare make any requests for freedom and justice relying on the stipulations of the helsinki final act are either confined to mental hospitals or sentenced to prison terms one case in particular that of mart niklus an estonian scientist is typical of those whose only crime is a

franklin roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion it then took only 9 more years to double that figure to 200 billion four yeexs later federal spending reached 300 billion and in just 2 more years it reached the 400 billion mark federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the

political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1 t ed but whether this is the best one possible house joint resolution 350 possesses economic and political virtues vital to the health of the american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would
