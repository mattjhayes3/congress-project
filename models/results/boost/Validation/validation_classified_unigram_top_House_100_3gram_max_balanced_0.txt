special order to point out the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however

was becoming increasingly apparent to all i suggested that he consider changing his vote but his simple answer was that he was locked in to his anticontra position i walked away deeply disappointed by that response i fear that there are at least some members of this house who may be planning to vote against contra and who believe in their hearts that support for this aid request is prudent at this

some time i have been reading from the book called the japanese conspiracy by marvin wolf which outlines the method that japan has used to target our indistries and of course there have been some questions as to whether mr wolf was accurate or whether he was not i was very happy when on sunday we found an article by a liberal columnist named richard reeves in the baltimore sun it was actually on august 9 he stated essentially what marvin wolf has claimed in his book the article is entitled the japan lobby and it explains how the japanese have cheated on their quotas with the british and how upset the british are with their behavior i will now read it it is datelined new york by richard reeves and it says you can buy a jeep with righthand drive at suzuki dealers in holland which seems strange because dutch cars have their steering wheels on the left the dutch drive the same way we do on the right side of the road he says it is the british who keep to the left and so need steering wheels on the right and in fact those dutch suzukis with englishlanguage dashboards and owners manuals are made and sold for the british market mr reeves points out the whole thing is a way one of many for japanese manufacturers to cheat on a court arrangement backed by the governments of great britain and japan this is how mr reeves says it works the japanese government and auto companies have agreed to restrict their exports to 11 percent of the british marketwhich is about 220 000 cars a year but when that quota has been met japanese ear dealers begin sending customers employees and relatives across the english channel to rotterdam to pick up the righthand drive cars there and bring them back to england as used cars such tricksand that is the word mr reeves usesaccording to auto

a land rover factory of course land rover produces vehicles fourwheeled vehicles these people see rules the conservative member says as something to get around rather than something to abide by mr reeves continues to write saying things like that at least in the united states leaves one open to charges of japan bashing a civil disorder that some would equate with racism or antieemitism i would suspect though that mr beaumontdark might be just as upset if he thought the swedes or norwegians were the ones threatening the jobs of his constituents japan bashing in the united states mr reeves says and he says which he thinks isa healthy indication that americans can still read and write and count has created an equal and opposite counterforce a japan lobby that lobbysecond now only to the israel lobby which seems to have been an inspiration to the japanesewas built and is supported by the pennies of hundreds of thousands of americans working for japan inc from toyota dealers to lumberjacks cutting trees in oregon to make chopsticks in tokyo and i might just point out at this juncture in this article that we have created 106 000 more jobs in japan than they have in the united states and that is according to harpers index mr reeves says that if a congressman or columnist says that maybe we should take a look at whats happening and whether its good for all of us a reassuring face appears on television to say we dont understand free trade or something equally sacred it could be elliot richardsonelliot richardson according to business week is now chairman of the 25 million

would take their money and go home i think we should have given it a chance that number and others come from the research of pat choate a vice president of trw who is writing a book on foreign impact on the unitedstates economy and who also reports that 152 japanese companies and government agencies paid 100 million last year to 113 washington law firms and publicrelations agencies for lobbying in

one represented by mr richardson and the association of foreign investors in real estate were both formed just this year reeves said that my own japanbashing credentials are i think in order even though i believe in free and fair trade its that i dont see japan practicing free trade or considering fairness at all i think in fact that japans willful selfinterested abuses of the spirit and letter of international trade agreements and systemsthe complaint of mr beanumontdark in englandcould destroy those systems if other major traders begin to play the game the japanese way continuing with mr reeves he said i said something like that to a japanese ambassador to a major industrial country a few weeks ago and he said in sadness not anger you have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country i say nonsense to that attitude because japan is a very strong aggressive country it is certainly the largest economic power in the world now mr reeves said what about us do you think america and americans can be pushed too far the japanese ambassador responded no you are flexible enough to take anything mr reeves concluded with his comment that the ambassador may have intended a compliment but that he mr reeves took it as a misjudgment that may cost both of us greatly the conclusion of this article is certainly most interesting to me i was surprised that a japanese ambassador would tell mr reeves thatyou have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country what does this mean to us does it call into question the reliability of their intentions as a friend it is a basic tenet of american life that we may argue with our friends over polltics and principle but you are still my friend we learn very early as youngsters the ground rules for friendship and not to step over a line because it would be an affront to a friend in fact anyone involved in politics has learned this lesson well and cherishes the individuality of our friends and our constituents this remark of the ambassadors is putting the burden of the relationship on the united states when he was asked do you think america and americans can be pushed too far he replied no you are flexible enough to take anything there is something that should be understood about the americans we are flexible but we will not take everything one of the outstanding features of being an american and living under this great constitution and prizing freedom the way we do is that americans have a sense of fair play i had a friend who succinctly expressed what fair play means to us she said americans are essentially free spirits because they prize freedom to protect it when youve cut their options they turn hostile the ambassador should know what we all understand we do not take everything off of everybody friendship is a twoway street when it becomes a real burden to us then difficulties begin i am including the article by mr reeves in the

the creator where freedom of the press stops at the doors of the prosoviet bureaucracy there can be no liberty al knew that communism was an aberration completely foreign to the free spirit of the polish people a system imported on the backs of tanks after world war ii the weakened nation of poland had no respite from the terrors of a totalitarian regime the echoes of the nazi holocaust had barely faded before the crying was heard anew under soviet occupation in his observations of poland he saw that the polish people were as disenfranchised economically as they were politically al did his best to encourage investment in a stagnated economy where for the worker the only reward is a ration card the only relaxation a predawn vigil in a food line to address these problems al founded and headed the polish american congress charitable organization it was this foundation that was the american lifeline of the solidarity movement raising 150 million for the polish people following the 1980 strikes led by lech welesa he also played a stellar role in coordinating lech walesas trip to chicago a year later al was an active member on the united states holocaust commission bringing attention to the 3 million nonjewish poles slaughtered during world war ii under hitlers directive the lifetime works of aloylsius mazewski are clear examples of his dedication to the polish people

of the polish american congress originally a social and cultural organization he expanded its objectives until it became an influential national group the pac today publishes a wellcirculated newspaper for the community and is deeply involved in congressional actions concerning the polish people and its government as a spokesman for polish issues and ethnicamerican concerns in general aloysius was an integral part of united states foreign policy he served as confidant to the last six unitedstates presidents many unitedstates senators representatives and pope john paul 11 in 1970 he became the first polish american to be named a special delegate to the united nations he later served as a unitedstates delegate to the international human rights conference al worked intensively with the chicago legal community he was a well known practicing attorney a bar association member and participated on the judiciary society al mazewski was a friend to all ethnic americans who sought to achieve a more free and just world america has a proud tradition of ethnic mutual benefit societies thousands of immigrants have been led out of poverty and made to feel at home by the society in

problems i see with title iv how does my substitute address these concerns one my substitute would eliminate the council on industrial competitiveness act this proposal in the bill would create a council composed of 16 members appointed by the president after consideration of such recommendations as may be submitted by the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate last year this was to be funded at 25 million it is to be funded now at 5 million a year if you read the language of the bill as to the duties of the council they are extensive its mission was changed from a central coordinating body with full control over trade policy to a more limited advisory council within the white house but the concept is clear it would institutionalize a government strategic planning process at the expense of decentralized marketoriented forces it is merely advisory it would be duplicative of functions being already carried out by other governmental agencies if its purpose is to be a central planning agency to pick winners and losers in the international marketplace it portends a very dangerous precedent indeed we do not need a council on industrial competitiveness the president has not asked for it and he does not want it two my substitute would strike the section which would call for the establishment of a competitive exchange rate the competitive exchange rate as defined in the bill is the set of exchange rates that would be consistent with an appropriate and sustainable balance in the current account as determined by the secretary of the treasury based on the appropriate methodology that takes into account the appropriate factors which provide the most opportune prospects for economic growth i do not know what that means and i doubt if anybody else does the bill further says all exchange rates also will be indexed to all appropriate currencies the experts agree that it is not possible to identify with precision what a competitive exchange rate is or should be at any given time the point i make is this provision evades the issue by mandating the secretary of the treasury to make such determinations my amendment recognizes that the recent overvaluation of the dollar has contributed to our trade deficit it certainly was not the only cause my substitute provides a mechanism for holding the administration accountable on any exchange rate negotiations through regular reporting requirements to congress it also encourages exchange market intervention in situations where currency volatility disrupts the unitedstates econ omy and our competitive position is jeopardized my substitute provides for negotiations with countries that manipulate their currencies in violation of international obligations it does not ignore the problem but takes a much more realistic approach it recognizes recent successes following the 1985 plaza agreement the toyko summit and the recent lourve agreement the most mischievous part of title iv on this issue directs the secretary of the treasury to buy and sell currencies to assist the gradual movement of the actual exchange of the dollar toward its competitive exchange rate we have common obligations with other countries under the provisions of the international monetary fund agreement which this provision would violate it could also be disruptive of the international bond market and our own bond market as well the worst of title iv is yet to come that is the provision which would direct the secretary of the treasury to initiate negotiations for the creation of a new international debt management facility this new organization would buy hold and resell if possible the sovereign debt of developing countries from creditor banks at discount rates in the last congress this was to be a new bank at the world bank i call it a world bank bank my substitute drops this proposal in its entirety because the proposal is poorly thought out in detail how would it be funded at first it was to be funded through contributions from member countries the chances of appropriating tax moneys to finance a facility to buy bad bank loans from other countries are not slim and none it is none h r 3 alludes to the possibility of taking the gold of the imf as collateral for the securities of this new international debt management authority or borrowing surplus funds from the world bank neither is feasible in the end the taxpayers of the sponsoring countries will have to stand up for the capitalization of the new facility if it is to be capitalized i suggest we are wasting our time with this one my substitute would include provisions on which there has been more thought and which there is a good deal of bipartisan effort they include the multilateral guarantee agency act and the export trading company amendments act which i would commend the gentleman from rhode island the chairman of the full committee for this excellent work and the work he did

abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the
