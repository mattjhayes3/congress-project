dumping of radioactive waste only after congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the united states retains its leadership position in protecting the worlds marine environment the relevance of the united states banning radioactive dumping is far reaching historically the united states has set international policy on ocean dumping of radioactive waste until last year the united states had resisted an international ban through the united states influence the issue was left unresolved that all changed last november when the clinton administration reversed the united states policy and announced its support for a ban the reversal which was brought on in part by heavy lobbying from the global legislators organization for a balanced environment enabled the international community to amend the

hearing on the threat of contamination from the russian dumping of nuclear waste for four decades the former soviet union and now the russian republic has been dumping nuclear waste from nuclear submarines and weapons plants into the worlds oceans the information gathered by the subcommittee was sobering the wests first concrete evidence about the dumping came last sumtumer following the release of the yablokov report which was commissioned by president boris yeltsin to detail the extent of soviet nuclear disposal at sea according to the report the soviet union had dumped over 2 5 million curies of radioactive waste into the arctic ocean and other marine environments by comparison the accident at three mile island in my home state of pennsylvania released 15 curies of radiation during the hearing the subcommittee discovered that since 1959 the former soviet union dumped 18 nuclear reactors a reactor screen 11 000 to 17 000 cannisters of nuclear waste and hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of

committee has reported that without their recommended changes congress could be placing an additional cost of almost 1 billion on the industrial fastener manufacturing industry the report states that if enacted without the recommendation changes could have a devastating economic influence upon all factsof our industry but especially to small businesses that manufacture distribute specific fasteners that are covered by the act further the report explains congress believed the act would cover only 1 percent or 60 million of fasteners sold in commerce not the 55 percent of the market as estimated by the fastener industry coalition that would be affected i believe it is important to make clear that the intent of congress was truly that 1 percent of those fasteners used in critical applications would be covered that 1 percent of the market place should not be damaging to the small business manufactures trying to complete in the other 99 percent of the market my amendment that is before us now would allow for first allowance for chemistry certification from raw material vendors to be used the fastener manufacturer cannot change the chemistry of the raw material therefore all testing of chemistry for finished fastener lots would be redundant as long as lot traceability to the mill heat of the raw material has been maintained it is my understanding that nist has agreed to work out regulation language that will allow current inventories to be utilized as the nist accreditation process takes place failing to adopt this particular provision would have an estimated cost to the industry of between 100 million to 286 million further my amendment redefines the definition of the sale of fasteners with minor nonconformances historically the industry has allowed for the sale of minor nonconformances this provision just allows fastener industry to maintain the industry standard this provision is intended to ensure that the fastener quality act will not be interpreted to override the provisions of industry and government standards these standards provide procedures and safeguards for the sale or other accepted means of disposing of fasteners found to deviate from one

acknowledged the cost to be 375 million for all distributors to comply with an estimated ongoing yearly cost to each distributor of 65 000 unfortunately this was not something that we were able to get worked out in our negotiations and we could not agree that this mixing of fasteners or what is called commingling should take place i personally have heard from the fastener industry coalition which

rich will buy taxfree bonds or find other loopholes to shelter their incomes taxes in the end always come back to the middle and lower middleincome people they always have and always will and they

why did they support the last bill i think the answer to that is they did not believe that the last bill could be improved that the effort would be made to do so however we demonstrated in the house of representatives a week ago that it could be improved by the vote that we took to send the bill back to conference i believe we have a better bill today than we had a week ago i want to sincerely congratulate both the republicans and the democrats who worked on the bill nevertheless if we can improve it after two allnight sessions i believe it can still be improved more if we take some more time for that reason i oppose the conference report that is on the floor today that does not mean i oppose a crime bill of course but i believe that we have demonstrated those of us who voted to send the bill back to the committee that it can be improved that it was improved and i believe it will be still further improved if we work on it further however the question arises what about the need to fight crime right now i believe that that need is met by supporting what will be introduced by the gentleman from florida as a motion to recommit the bipartisan hunterbrewster bill this will provide funding to police and to prisons and to the border patrol immediately and those are the areas that time after time after time are so often publicly mentioned as in need of that kind of support the criticism of that alternative is it does not include everything there are many members who want to see much more enacted to assist law enforcement and i agree with that as a former career prosecutor i believe efforts against career criminals are an extremely important tool for law enforcement i support the strongest threestrikesandyouareout provision we can write and in some violent crime cases two

committee for congressional reform it dawned on me that now may well be the last chance for congress to begin to regain credibility with american citizens we all must know that there is a great deal of contempt for this body throughout our nation selfinterest corruption scandals and selfindulgence have left deep scars on this body and serious internal injuries we wont cure this body with cosmetic surgery organ transplant would be more appropriate because our body is in the emergency room on life support we are going to have to be bipartisan and we are going to have to put the american people first we arent princes and princesses or dukes and duchesses in a feudal nation we are public servants and we must begin to serve and we must be held accountable for our actions out there in the 435 districts in this vast land there are people who voted for us because they believed they could couit on us to represent their interests and not our own and in my way of thinking that vote is a serious public trust america wants change no america demands change and we had better heed that demand and correct the way congress does the publics business as new members many of us do not feel party to the mistakes of the past our concern is the future as mr perot has said its time to clean out the barn and we had better listen the administrative cost of this body is very excessive and now we have an administration that is asking taxpayers to share the cost and share the pain of tax increases this body is no better than the american taxpayer we have to consider their pain and their cost and substantially cut the cost of congress even if it is painful to some members the bottom line is we have to simplify congress get rid of nonessential committees and put more common sense and frugality into legislative passage or rejection that is why i urge all my colleagues to join me by cutting the size and cost of all congressional committees by 25 percent the war cry is eliminate gridlock but this house manages to create its own gridlock we can begin to put an end to gridlock by eliminating the overwhelming power of the seniority system after all one member from 1 district out of 435 should not be in a position to dominate the actions of congress my district is just as important as the speakers district this is why the republican freshman class has managed to successfully push through term limits on all committee and subcommittee chairs tonight i urge my fellow freshmen democrats to join us in reforming this house by demanding the same concessions from their leadership we must have term limitations on all committee and subcommittee chairs if real reform is going to take place even if there might be some retaliation from senior members after all real congressional reform is what the american people are expecting the simple fact is that this house isnt the possession of the politicians that inhabit it this house belongs to the people of our nation who support us
