over a year of effort on the part of 12 scientific experts and four representatives from the lay diabetes community support was provided by dozens of other individuals both from within the national institutes of health and from outside the nih the working group was established by congress as part of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act and based on legislation i introduced in the last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an analysis of current spending and estimates programbyprogram of the cost of implementing each opportunity current spending the group reports is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem they calculate that an increase of 384 million in fiscal year 2000 rising to 1 166 billion in fiscal year 2004 is quote required to have a robust and effective diabetes research effort one which will reduce the rising burden created by this debilitating disease the release of the report has generated extraordinary interest among the scientific community some argue that advances in research must be present to generate an increased nih portfolio while others argue that the presence of research dollars will generate advances as in the case of aids by either standard the time to establish a national commitment to diabetes research is now congress must seize upon the momentum in diabetes research and fully enact the diabetes research working group report recommendations it will take a commitment of 827 million in the next fiscal year the scientific community has united to develop a concrete plan and now it is up to the congress to unite to make this plan a reality i must conclude by saying that this is a very important initiative for our country i know it is going to be a difficult year economically for the appropriations subcommittee that has to deal with this issue but i must say it is in the nations best interest it is in the interest of scientific research and the diabetic and all the complications that come from diabetes that the congress step up and say 827 million is the number i urge my colleagues to support this initiative in the house"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "3 5 million forms containing errors

the good news number one is that their loans were forgiven because they were disabled or dead the second bit of good news is they were neither disabled nor dead but the education department had identified them as such and had forgiven their loans most recently a theft ring and this is what happens when you do not have proper controls they had a purchasing agent within the department of

about these people down the street here in the department of education i want the money to get to the kids and to the teachers who know how to teach rather than the bureaucrats who know how to provide paperwork and produce more headaches for communities around the country this straight as proposal it is a big thing there are 760 federal education programs the edflex bill that we passed dealt with i think 9 of them 9 significant ones it was a big step in the right direction to follow up to take the next logical step to show the american people that we are serious about moving authority out of

help with a power impact wrench to change some blades on a woodson mower and we talked again and he said don i dont know how long this can go on i just dont know how long we can go on because i think the price of milk is what 10 50 to 12 i am not quite sure what it is but it is substantially lower than the 17 mark that it hit several months ago and i said henry the only thing i can tell you is this you are one of only 34 or 35 dairy farmers left in ogle county in neighboring stevenson county we have about 250 dairy farmers that is the number one dairy producing county in the state of illinois in the entire 16th congressional district which i represent which goes from the mississippi river all the way over to mchenry county which has harvard milk days and the same type of festival that the gentleman from wisconsin has there are 730 henry ebert families similarly situated similarly with the first generation trying to hand their farm over to the second generation and some night we will talk about estate taxes that makes that almost impossible to do without a huge bill to pay taxes on the farm that they own and henry sells to dean foods and i had a conversation today with gary corbett who is vp of industrial relations and he sent me this letter and attached a key to it and i want to read part of it for the record it said dear congressman manzullo i am writing on behalf of dean foods company which operates five plants and has a technical research center in the district that i represent he said please enough is enough already is the house ever going to tire of introducing dairy legislation and allow us to run our own business first we had the 1996 fair act which mandated federal order reform provided for the discontinuance of the price support program and promised more reliance on the market to let the market itself determine the price of milk that process has resulted in usda releasing its final rule on federal order reform which is to take effect on october 1 1999 that is the 1b the one that goes a long way it is not perfect but it is a good compromise of moving in the right direction and hats off to secretary glickman for really spearheading the gigantic effort on that he said no sooner was the final rule released than more legislation has been proposed in the house one to mandate class 1 differentials one which would extend the dairy price support program another one which provides for creation of dairy compacts he says does the house have nothing else to do but micromanage the dairy industry from washington that is the other thing the pricing is in eau claire but the managing comes from washington there is no industry in which congress interjects itself daily except the dairy industry corbett says reject dairy compacts they represent socialism at its finest we cannot live with a system that picks a price out of the air with no basis in supply and demand fundamentals the soviet union tried it for four decades it was a miserable failure and it will fail in the unitedstates while we view compacts as the total antithesis of the american system of free enterprise we are just as concerned that congress feels the need to continue promulgating dairy legislation without waiting to observe the impact of legislation previously passed we are totally exasperated at the houses continual effort to micromanage our industry from washington i remind you this is dean foods company which is the processor that buys the milkfrom henry ebert who lives on conger road in egan illinois and is my nextdoor neighbor below is a key to our offices he taped a key in fact here is a photocopy it is amazing that the key that he taped was a key from an old cadillac car i said that is as close as i will ever get to a cadillac he said we grabbed any key that we could around here that was excess we just taped it to these letters that we sent out of course it is symbolic he said below is a key to our offices you might as well come run our business directly rather than try from d c then maybe you can feel the same frustration we experience in having our business turned upside down regularly through congressional intervention let the 1996 fair act have a chance to work that is the law that the gentleman from wisconsin described that mandated the department of agriculture come up with a workable solution moving toward a free enterprise system he says stand by the promise of the 1996 farm bill to deliver a dairy policy that is more market oriented and consumer friendly we do not need this narrow economic selfinterest piece of legislation burdening our industry so here is dean food which has i think operations in 37 states saying look it we are standing alongside the farmers the dairy farmers in your district let us be able to move forward to be able to allow the market to operate on a free enterprise basis we also had the original j l kraft cheese factory in our district over in jo daviess county which buys a

would think they would want to have the ideas of congress like the postcensus local review give those local officials like they had in 1990 a chance to have a quality check another issue they are opposing and let me tell my colleagues this they are opposing making the census form available in numerous languages and braille they said we are going to put it in five languages besides english and if you know of another language tough you have to call an 800 number and hopefully you will find somebody who can translate and if you are blind you know tough i mean what do you do that is so sad they are opposed to it it is not that difficult to make available forms for those that request it to get these forms i was in miami we had a hearing back in december the gentlewoman from florida has about 150 000 haitians in her district now a lot of them have not learned english yet and how do they fill out a form our colleague the gentleman from california from long beach he has about 50 000 cambodians in his district now how do they fill out a form if an elderly person now somebody would say oh they should not be counted but everybody living in this country gets counted it is required by our united states constitution and here is amazing this is the democratic party that wants to reach out to everybody and they are refusing to publish the seven questions only seven questions in these languages and one of our bills is to put it out in 33 languages plus braille rather than the five languages their argument is well our five languages we get 99 percent of the people well 1 percent of the american people is 2 7 million people and we only missed 1 6 percent of the population last time why are they afraid to do that i mean it is the republicans are out there trying to make it more accessible to have everybody fill out the form and so i mean it is so frustrating that they say we are perfect we do not make mistakes and we are all professionals and you know do not micromanage well do not micromanage they are the ones that spent a billion dollars over the past 7 years on a illegal plan and it was not until january that they you know we got hit in the head they realized yes it was illegal and they said that is the reason we are going to go to two numbers i mean it is an amazing organization to deal with and these other ideas we are proposing it was another one they are opposed to is and this has support from general accounting office and at one time the academy of sciences supported it we get one form in the mail and you know hopefully everybody returns it we get as many as we can returned but if you send the second form as a reminder it will increase response rates by 6 or 7 percent they tried that out when they did what is called a dress rehearsal last year in sacramento and columbia south carolina they will get a 6 or 7 percent improvement on response rate that is about 19 million people that many fewer forms have to be filled out and they are opposed to it they are going to fight it and the president is going to veto it he is going to veto those 33 languages he is going to veto postcensus review i do not understand their logic it is so frustrating i mean even we had one program we debated for probably 45 minutes yesterday in committee it is something called census in the school program it is a good program and i hope when it becomes available that you can go to your schools and promote it especially when you go to the indian schools which we visited when we were in your district it was really kind of neat to see the indian schools there because what the census in school form is is going to be a form that is going to be sent out to the teachers of elementary schools in elementary schools and selected teachers in middle and secondary schools that teach geography i think government math i think three different categories and the idea is they will get a request if they want to participate in the program send back a card and they will get maps and materials and it is a good way to teach a civics lesson and you know they can teach mathematics they can teach geography there are lots of things kids can learn about the census and the constitution on it if the teachers want to so we are going to make it available the census bureau was only going to make it available to 20 percent of the schools and we think it is a good program so we commend them and say we think it should be made available to everybody all the schools they are contracting it out so it is not like extra work for them there is a group called scholastic inc that has got the contract and it is just a matter of sending the letter to all these teachers and if they like it send back a card and they fought us and fought us and fought us yesterday over that issue and they finally agreed to let it go by voice vote and i understand i said are you opposed to 60 percent of the teachers receiving this why are you opposed to the possibility of helping kids we

congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators

electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and would ensure that no new purpa contracts would be required it recognizes the legitimate current expectations of qf developers and utility purchasers i believe that it represents a broad based consensus on this important issue and i would urge that this measure be included in whatever electric industry legislation might be considered by

limited use as an elementary school site h r 4656 is a product of much hard work compromise and discussion and strikes a careful balance that will benefit all parties involved and provide over 400 students at incline village with a safe and accommodating school facility local officials from both the school district and the united states forest service as well as environmental groups such as the league to save lake tahoe have had an integral role in crafting this important legislation as a result of this valuable local input this legislation is supported by the entire nevada congressional

school was constructed in 1964 and can no longer meet the needs of an increasing student population the overcrowding problems have become so severe that the school must now place up to 40 children in each classroom there is simply no room left to expand the current school and the only available land suitable for a new school is the federal land to be sold to the county school district under h r

construction instead the school district will pay the fair market value for the land for its use as a school site yet i understand the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to get 800 percent more for this land than its appraised value would be as a school site this is just unconscionable to me that the administration wants to put such a high price on the

remarks made after the vote this was not a vote against the troops this was a vote against the policy of this administration all of us support the troops and the young men and women who are doing their duty but i think it is also sad i understand that people become so emotionally charged that if they lose they automatically say this was a partisan vote and i understand that but i think it is important to remember that these are very serious issues and all of us have very strong feelings about them and we may not all agree with the views of others but i think as we debate unitedstates involvement in kosovo it is important to remember that there has been political and religious turmoil in kosovo since at least 1389 the muslim forces of the ottoman empire defeated serb forces on the plains of kosovo at a place called the field of black birds and kosovo has been a sacred place for muslims and orthodox serbs for generations it is unimaginable really that either group would ever be forced to leave a place they consider their homeland now today in the new york times and other national magazines our military commanders of nato acknowledged that 5 weeks of intensive bombing has failed to reduce the size of the serbian forces in kosovo or in their operations against albanians the 4 423 bombing sorties may have rendered serb air defenses ineffective but air strikes have not accomplished the stated purpose to stop the ethnic cleansing of the kosovars however innocent civilians in belgrade in kosovo and other locations throughout serbia and yugoslavia have been killed by nato air strikes and the number of civilian casualties and incidents of misdirected weapons continues to increase relentless bombing has become ineffective and the more it continues the more innocent civilians are going to be killed and injured in kosovo and in serbia and certainly a military action in which the only victims are civilians will not be long supported by the world community now i do not think we should mislead the american people we already are in a quagmire in yugoslavia and there is no easy way out and it is very complex but in my view and the reason that i have voted against the resolution this evening because we have all sat by and we have watched these relentless air strikes that are totally destroying the infrastructure of yugoslavia and in the near future they are going to be coming back to america to help rebuild the country but the reason i voted against the resolution tonight giving the president authority to continue these air strikes is because i believe that at this point america only has two options one is an allout ground war with air support to recapture kosovo now this option would require over 75 000 ground troops casualties would be inevitable and troop presence would be essential to protect kosovars for a long time once the war was completed the other option is a diplomatic solution the goal of nato should be to return the kosovars to kosovo a military presence will be required to assure their safety and of course serbian forces must be removed now there have been some indications recently that mr milosevic may accept and be willing and required to accept the presence of foreign troops in kosovo in fact he alluded to that in a recent interview with cspan so i think that we have a real opportunity here through the russians through our nato allies through others that have contacts with mr milosevic to push this opportunity i hope the president and his advisers will pursue a diplomatic solution as soon as possible to end

last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated

opposing and let me tell my colleagues this they are opposing making the census form available in numerous languages and braille they said we are going to put it in five languages besides english and if you know of another language tough you have to call an 800 number and hopefully you will find somebody who can translate and if you are blind you know tough i mean what do you do that is so sad they are opposed to it it is not that difficult to make available forms for those that request it to get these forms i was in miami we had a hearing back in december the gentlewoman from florida has about 150 000 haitians in her district now a lot of them have not learned english yet and how do they fill out a form our colleague the gentleman from california from long beach he has about 50 000 cambodians in his district now how do they fill out a form if an elderly person now somebody would say oh they should not be counted but everybody living in this country gets counted it is required by our united states constitution and here is amazing this is the democratic party that wants to reach out to everybody and they are refusing to publish the seven questions only seven questions in these languages and one of our bills is to put it out in 33 languages plus braille rather than the five languages their argument is well our five languages we get 99 percent of the people well 1 percent of the american people is 2 7 million people and we only missed 1 6 percent of the population last time why are they afraid to do that i mean it is the republicans are out there trying to make it more accessible to have everybody fill out the form and so i mean it is so frustrating that they say we are perfect we do not make mistakes and we are all professionals and you know do not micromanage well do not micromanage they are the ones that spent a billion dollars over the past 7 years on a illegal plan and it was not until january that they you know we got hit in the head they realized yes it was illegal and they said that is the reason we are going to go to two numbers i mean it is an amazing organization to deal with and these other ideas we are proposing it was another one they are opposed to is and this has support from general accounting office and at one time the academy of sciences supported it we get one form in the mail and you know hopefully everybody returns it we get as many as we can returned but if you send the second form as a reminder it will increase response rates by 6 or 7 percent they tried that out when they did what is called a dress rehearsal last year in sacramento and columbia south carolina they will get a 6 or 7 percent improvement on response rate that is about 19 million people that many fewer forms have to be filled out and they are opposed to it they are going to fight it and the president is going to veto it he is going to veto those 33 languages he is going to veto postcensus review i do not understand their logic it is so frustrating i mean even we had one program we debated for probably 45 minutes yesterday in committee it is something called census in the school program it is a good program and i hope when it becomes available that you can go to your schools and promote it especially when you go to the indian schools which we visited when we were in your district it was really kind of neat to see the indian schools there because what the census in school form is is going to be a form that is going to be sent out to the teachers of elementary schools in elementary schools and selected teachers in middle and secondary schools that teach geography i think government math i think three different categories and the idea is they will get a request if they want to participate in the program send back a card and they will get maps and materials and it is a good way to teach a civics lesson and you know they can teach mathematics they can teach geography there are lots of things kids can learn about the census and the constitution on it if the teachers want to so we are going to make it available the census bureau was only going to make it available to 20 percent of the schools and we think it is a good program so we commend them and say we think it should be made available to everybody all the schools they are contracting it out so it is not like extra work for them there is a group called scholastic inc that has got the contract and it is just a matter of sending the letter to all these teachers and if they like it send back a card and they fought us and fought us and fought us yesterday over that issue and they finally agreed to let it go by voice vote and i understand i said are you opposed to 60 percent of the teachers receiving this why are you opposed to the possibility of helping kids we

program will be named after him we all realize that to succeed in todays society every person must be able to read and write it is unacceptable that in a country as advanced as ours that we have millions of people who cannot read or write h r 3222 helps to address this issue in several ways first it would improve the quality of even start and other family literacy programs in several areas it would provide training and technical assistance to local providers while at the same time assuring that the level of assistance does not decrease it also requires that instructional programs are based on scientifically researched methods of teaching reading and provides funding for research on teaching of reading to adults in family literacy programs finally it establishes qualifications for instructional staff in even start programs whose salaries are paid with even start dollars additionally h r 3222 provides for charitable choice by allowing government to consider religious organizations as part of eligible partnerships on the same basis as other groups receiving funding our churches synagogues mosques and other religious organizations have a long tradition of helping those in need in our country including helping those who cannot read this legislation helps them to carry on with that tradition in ensuring every american can read finally this legislation will help communities implement the inexpensive book distribution program which helps local communities provide books for disadvantaged children once again i urge passage of h r 3222 and yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "back home in colorado school is just getting underway three of those kids in public schools are my own and i care about education and i like most parents want the unitedstates department of education to get the money that it spends to the classroom i do not want to see the department waste any more on bureaucracy and red tape and i am tired of the theft the fraud and the abuse that goes on at the department of education that robs children of the precious resources they need we spend 40 million a year on accountants and overseers and auditors to make sure that the money the department gets does get to the children and the classroom but it was a car dealer in hyattsville maryland that found the latest fraud of department employees defrauding 2 million of the unitedstates department of education into personal bank accounts let us get money to the classroom let us get rid of the waste fraud and abuse at the unitedstates department of education let us put children before crime and bureaucracy"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "briefly i urge my colleagues to vote against this perverse and misguided motion to instruct i agree the trend of medicare choice plans pulling out of areas across the country is enormously disturbing but may i suggest to the folks on the other side that they have offered exactly the wrong solution by forcing plans to commit to 3 years we are ensuring that plans who are struggling to maintain their service will leave now right now medicare choice funding as the gentleman from california noted is too unpredictable under current hcfa policy this motion adds no accountability just a poison pill i find it ironic that the democrats and the president have spent the past week tearing apart the medicare bill that this house passed calling the money spent on medicare choice plans unjustified if anyone thinks that the money dedicated to shoring up medicare choice plans is unjustifiable i invite them to come to erie crawford and mercer county pennsylvania i invite them to explain that to seniors who are facing copays that will double in january and decrease benefits if they are indeed serious about stabilizing medicare choice then i urge our friends on the other side of the aisle to drop this and urge the president to sign the house package and work with us to ensure that seniors relying on these plans continue to have access to quality health care do not simply adopt populist poses and deploy vacant partisan rhetoric while requiring medicare choice plans to be at the mercy of hcfa for 3 years this is no solution they will simply leave and seniors will be left holding the bag"]]}
