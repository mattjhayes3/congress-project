health fund and rescinds any unobligated funds republicans are on the floor today to fulfill part of our pledge to america that we would cut spending and we would repeal the democrats health care bill passed a year ago on january 19 this house passed h r 2 to repeal obamacare completely the ruling liberal democrats in the senate however have so far refused to consider h r 2 but house republicans remain undeterred we will repeal obamacare piece by piece if that is what it takes because the liberal elites knew their government takeover of health care was unpopular and would likely have consequences at the ballot box they included 105 billion in mandatory taxpayer spending in the law itself to protect their favorite programs let me take a moment to explain the difference between discretionary and mandatory government spending first its important to remember that the federal government does not have any money of its own as it has only what it takes in taxes from hardworking americans or money that it borrows from foreign creditors and our future generations we are currently borrowing 43 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends discretionary spending is appropriated by congress annually and therefore subject to congressional oversight and review discretionary spending allows congress to be wise stewards of the taxpayers money by not funding ineffective or duplicative programs however what is called mandatory spending funds programs for people who meet certain criteria and occurs irrespective of congressional appropriations and must be spent whether we have the money or not the most recognized mandatory spending programs are medicare medicaid and social security which operate on autopilot and have not been subject to congressional oversight from yeartoyear as funds automatically stream from the treasury to anyone who qualifies that is meets the criteria for a particular benefit the bill before us today h r 1217 would repeal a portion of mandatory obamacare spending and eliminate a slush fund established for health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius this slush fund known as the prevention and public health fund will automatically receive 1 billion when fiscal year 2012 begins in october of this year with automatic increases every year until it reaches 2 billion annually in fiscal year 2015 however theres a very important distinction between this funding and that for medicare and social security in that this funding does not state eligibility criteria the liberal elites in washington think they know how to spend the taxpayers money better than individual taxpayers and gives secretary sebelius 2 billion a year until congress acts to repeal her authority to spend without accountability republicans are rejecting this slush fund by considering this bill which would repeal the fund and take back any money that has not already been spent this year the slush fund is not subject to the annual appropriations process and therefore would not be subject to yearly congressional oversight the money will be made available to the secretary regardless of how she chooses to spend it and whether or not the programs being funded are actually effective again this is not like medicare and social security there are no criteria for the spending of this money its important to point out that this bill does not cut any specific program because the slush fund is used by the secretary to increase spending above congressionally appropriated levels for whatever program the secretary chooses my colleagues across the aisle will argue that this money is being used to train primary care physicians to prevent obesity and to encourage healthy lifestyles what they wont tell you is that they have absolutely no idea how the money is being used because they abdicated the authority of congress to an unelected bureaucrat the simple truth is that the money is just as likely to be spent on elective abortion as it is for any other purpose in the democrats dissenting views from the house energy and commerce committee report they say without mandatory spending for this slush fund the programs will not be adequately funded well thats what the whole process for appropriations is all about if the programs need more money its up to them to come and justify that however they sang a different tune when liberal house democrats rammed through a government takeover of health care in november of 2009 they created this slush fund but made it subject to the regular appropriations process that meant it was subject to yearly congressional oversight and direction for how the money would be spent but when the ruling liberal democrats in the senate sent over their version of the health care bill which became law the slush fund had been made mandatory the liberal elites claim they put in a safeguard because part of the section creating this slush fund states that congress has the authority to direct how this funding is spent well as any high school junior civics student could tell you congress always has the authority to direct redirect repeal or increase funding congress can always pass a new law to change the direction of any funding stream thats our job as legislators the need to state explicitly that we have the authority to direct spending in a slush fund is pointless the simple truth is that we have a spending crisis in this town in large part due to mandatory spending that operates on autopilot instead of working to address our unsustainable spending habits the ruling democrats refused even to offer a budget resolution last year or pass a single appropriations bill the liberal elites failed to lead despite having unchecked control of all levers of power in washington i brought a chart with me today to help illustrate the fact that mandatory spending is out of control in washington let me show you that because of mandatory spending being on autopilot by the year 2050 the mandatory spending will absorb all revenue coming into the federal government all tax revenue coming into the federal government that simply is unsustainable we cannot operate our country when we let three programs take up all of the money that comes into the federal government something has to be done and yet the democrats want to add another program to this which would speed up this process we dont need that as washington liberals ignored the growing autopilot spending crisis adding more unaccountable mandatory spending in the hands of unelected bureaucrats house republicans are now working hard to protect the future for our children and grandchildren by restoring congressional oversight of spending now i am sure many americans are wondering how a slush fund with a clever title would be spent and why it must be put on autopilot let me give you an example pitt county in my home state of north carolina received funding from this fund to fix prices at convenience stores so that healthy foods would be less expensive and therefore supposedly more attractive to the consumer in addition the pitt county health department now plans to use some of this money to put up signs indicating the location of public parks bike lanes and alternate transportation although i am certainly not opposed to parks or healthy eating habits it seems quite clear that the founders of this country did not intend the federal department of health and human services in washington dc to use taxpayer money to subsidize granola bars or purchase signs for bike lanes or parks the federal government has no business paying for local and community initiatives such as these especially when we are borrowing 43 cents of every dollar the federal government spends to pay for it the new house republican majority is ready to lead this country out of our debt crisis and it starts with voting for this rule and the underlying bill which will save taxpayers 16 billion with that

evening and we have this conversation as we move forward the gentleman from mississippi touched on something that is extremely important when it comes to this issue with the adoption and the repeal of obamacare what were trying to send to the american people is a message that the folks on this side of the aisle in particular want to make sure that we tackle health care reform and one we take care of the critical issue and that is how are we going to change the cost escalators that are occurring in health care every year how are we going to do that now the fundamental principle over here on our side of the aisle that i firmly believe in is that we are going to do that once we repeal this law by taking reforms from the perspective of the individual from the patient and from the doctors point of view not from the obamacare model of handing it to administrators and bureaucrats and somehow thinking that the government has the solution to this problem what were going to deploy in my opinion are good oldfashioned market forces forces of individual choice having individuals and patients and doctors control their health care destiny rather than having some unelected bureaucrat under the independent payment advisory board making determinations as to what type of health care youre going to receive we can do better than that in america the gentleman from mississippi makes a great point when he talks about the expansion and the tax burden that this law puts on all americans in particular many folks i heard the debate over the last couple of days said we have used up floor time when we should be focusing on jobs well you know what this is related to jobs because of the expansion of government the mandates that come from this and the higher taxes that are placed on all americans as a result of this will saddle our private sector will saddle our individuals they will saddle our job creators with a burden that they just cant overcome what we should be doing is relieving those burdens so that they can hire the people of today and tomorrow this expansion of government just doesnt stop today if it is allowed to go forwardand i hope my colleagues in the senate take this bill up so the american people know exactly where they standbut if this bill is allowed to go forward we are saddling americans with a burden both tax and government regulations and mandates to a point where we are just asking them to do something where they have just got a load that is too heavy to bear and thats just simply to hire people but you cant hire people if you have more taxes and you have got more burdens and obligations of government regulations to comply with i see my friend from mississippi may have a couple more comments on the topic"], [0.0008165420149452984,

this body it became time to actually bring some of the slides we actually do in our town halls back in arizona i like to refer to it as a combination of truth on the numbers and also dispelling some of the political folklore that is rampant both in this town im going to say a number of things this evening that i promise you will offend all sorts of members all sorts of this washington d c but look im a freshman ive been here 140some days and washington d c has systemically not told the truth to the american people i dont know if theyre fearful of looking the american people in the eyes and saying look heres what weve done to your future your kids future your grandkids future is so scary that they dont get reelected well i got elected to come here and do the numbers and so my goal is very very simple the numbers are straight up the numbers come from 2010 on a lot of the charts so we know exactly what was actually spent on a number of charts outside that were also going to use the presidents numbers but lets run through this we were just watching judge carter a couple of minutes ago walk through some of the economic impacts of what happens with drilling im going to even touch through this on the folklore of well lets go tax big oil and what it actually produces first of all the slide right next to me this one we put together just to make it simple and visual imagine a country that borrows 42 pennies 42 pennies out of every dollar we spend we all know thats not sustainable we cant do this you couldnt do it in your family budget think of it over the last couple of years its been tough out there your family my family we all cinched our belts the american families got tough and did what was necessary what did the congress do what did this government do what did washington d c do they just kept spending but the way they spent is they found people who were willing to buy unitedstates sovereign debt and they kept borrowing and today we now borrow 42 cents out of every dollar now why is that so terrifying well its terrifying because you start to realize the speed the debt is growing and then you start to understand some of the other drivers in that debt one of the things that happened january 1 this year you know what was the big change baby boomers every 8 seconds someone turns 65 in this country for the next 18 years so think of that ten thousand a day for the next 18 years thats why you see many of us around here saying we need to tell the truth how devastatingly ugly these numbers are and that if we step up and deal with it now we can fix it but you cant deal with it with a bunch of silly rhetoric so lets walk through some more of these slides right here is the 2010 and you see this blue the blue is well call it mandatory spending entitlements medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt but look when you step up when you step up to what is functionally four budget years from now because we just did the 2012 budget looking at 2016 you start to realize the growth in the spending the growth in the entitlements one of the things that keeps not being shared with the american people is when you look at our 2010 and the 2011 number here would be out a little bit further we dont take in enough revenue today to even cover the mandatory spending if you see our revenue line it cuts through right about here so think of that every dime of defense is borrowed every single dime of discretionary is borrowed and were about 100 billion short on even coyering the entitlements the mandatory spending we borrow a little piece of those dollars that go into the entitlements and it continues to explode in the future years i know these are a lot of slides but when we get down to the ending part i think youre going to find some of them sort of fun but we first have to walk through sort of an understanding of the pie chart this is 2010 2010 the mandatory spending was sitting about 63 percent 62 percent of all the spending in government defense department other discretionary and when i said all the spending in government understand things like fannie mae freddie mac arent even part of this theyre off the books on this now when you look at this line here that blue look how fast it starts to move up in 2016 it goes from here where were about 63 percent and now we hit 72 percent think of that we just did what the 2012 budget 2016 four budget cycles from now the mandatory spending the entitlements are consuming 72 percent of our budget the amazing thing is in that cycle the money that is going to discretionary actually we predict to go down in those 4 years so you start to understand the mandatory is consuming what we are you get folks who start to raise their hands at some of the town halls and say well why not just raise the marginal tax rates lets go out and tax everyone a little bit more theres some fascinating math on that and weve got 60 years of history looking at it this is one of my favorite charts for someone that wants to follow this you can actually goand i have a tough last nameits schweikert house gov youll see these charts on there this is when we had very high marginal tax rates back in the forties fifties early sixties very high marginal tax rates over here is where we have very low marginal tax rates and theres this normalizing effect theres actually a couple of ph d s whove written very detailed papers on this normalizing effect or even during times of very high marginal tax rates and very low marginal tax rates guess what happens we take in about 18 2 percent of gross domestic product i dont know maybe in the math out there maybe in the logic out there maybe in the human nature there when you tax people a lot they find other ways to take their income maybe when you tax them low they are willing to work more hours but somehow high marginal tax rates low marginal tax rates we basically take in the same percentage of gross domestic product of gdp it hits that 18 2 percent so when folks look at you in the eye and say oh just raise marginal tax rateswere going to tax the rich more were going to tax everyone moreit doesnt do it it doesnt take care of this massive debt that is consuming us as a people what you have to do is you have to grow that line which is the size of the economy you must grow this economy because as you start to look through these numbers you come to the realization yeah we have a huge spending problem but we can never cut enough we have to grow because its two sides of this pendulum and both of them have to be in motion we have to grow we have to cut the spending and we have to deal with the reality that the mandatory spending the entitlements are eating us alive lets actually start to walk on some of what i would like to refer to as political folklore when we hold many of our town halls back in my district and i am blessed to represent arizonas fifth district it is an amazingly wonderful place it is scottsdale and tempe fountain hills ahwatukee and mesa and we will often get hands that will pop up in the back of the room and say mr schweikert or david why dont we do this if we go out there and tax big oil we could balance the budget right they mean well i believe the participants at our town halls really mean well when they raise that hand because they have seen members of this body tell them that and they havent been told the truth when you look at the numbers here is 2011 hard dollars you can call them subsidies you can call them depletion allowances you can call them incentives to drill and produce more petroleum products but the gray here is fossil fuels and just for comparison we also put the 8 72 billion of the subsidies that go into green energy but for the fun of it lets just talk about this part right here the 2 44 billion that is in 2011 well think about this if you are borrowing about 4 7 billion every single day how can a member of congress look in the camera look at you and say well if we would just tax big oil more maybe that would help solve the debt problem it doesnt even make a drop in the bucket we can have a little fun with this because i have been trying to find a way to talk about big numbers i was blessed in my previous life i lived in a world of big numbers but how do you visualize 1 trillion how do you visualize 1 billion how do you visualize 1 million for many people so we have been playing with the idea of lets make it time so your government right now is borrowing about 4 7 billion every single day every single day so lets just think about it 4 7 billion every single day those taxes on big oillets make it this lets make it taxes on all lets just remove those depletion allowances those tax credits which are also tied to depreciation that all other businesses get but lets just wipe them all out guess what it buys you it buys you about 2 2 minutes of borrowing a day now how many of you feel like you have been told that you know once again we are engaging often around this place in political theater instead of math thats been one of my greatest frustrations in my short time here i wish i saw more members carrying around their financial calculators so they could look the american people in the eye and tell them the truth but think about that the whole we will call it fossil fuels subsidies tax credits depreciation allowances incentives to drill would buy you about 2 2 minutes a day oh come on and thats just assuming that every dollar came in and you didnt slow the economy down and didnt slow energy drilling down or energy production down so this is just throwing your hands up and saying lets just pretend for a moment that we got rid of those and it becomes pure income lets actually go to the next level because theres always that other person that raises their hands and says well david i have heard that if we would go out and we would tax the rich more remember that lame duck congress last december extended what a lot of folks call the bush tax cuts now around here we often call them the bushobama tax cuts because president obama is the one who signed them in december but they extended those tax cuts and werent those tax cuts for the rich and wouldnt that balance the budget well back to that small problem called math lets pretend for a moment that they hadnt happened and lets pretend that it didnt slow down the economy and lets pretend every dime that some folks have predicted came in a lot of this place operates in a fantasy world why cant we so we never had the tax extensions that happened in december what would it buy you well we once again borrow 4 7 billion every single day it would buy you about 28 minutes think of that 28 minutes so now im at my town hall ive had two hands go up the first one saying well david if we would tax big oil then that would balance the budget well what did we learn on the last slide that was about 2 2 minutes of borrowing every day and then the other hand goes up saying if we would tax the rich more as a matter of fact why dont we do in this slide that tax extenders never happened so everyone rich poor middle class didnt get the benefit of that extension of the tax cuts last december well guess what that buys you 28 minutes so think about it we are doing really well here we are up to 28 minutes plus 2 2 minutes so now lets see what if we do this because theres always the other hand that goes up and says david i bet you we could balance the budget and wouldnt have this debt and deficit if we did this we tax big oil and those bushobama tax extenders that happened last december in the lame duck session we never had that because those help the rich oh and by the way if we had never had the wars you know if we didnt have afghanistan if we didnt have iraqand i believe actually in our number here it didnt even have libyawe could balance the budget then couldnt we so we actually literally a couple hours ago sat down and said lets add it up and lets make it on a per hour basis so the american people can understand the crazy spending thats going on around this place and how fast the numbers are eroding on us back again to our math we borrow 4 7 billion every single day and lets go back to our pretend world every dime of those oil subsidies and depreciation allowances and tax credits come in and it doesnt actually slow down jobs or the economy and every dime of those taxes were to come in even though probably if you did that you would slow down the economy and people would work less and you would have less dollars but we are living in our fantasy world here and because we didnt have the wars none of that money would be going out the door even though certain portions of that are actually already built into the defense budget but every dime that is equated to iraq afghanistan and now libya what would it buy us well we are borrowing that 4 7 billion a day guess what it buys you 3 hours of borrowing think about what you have heard around here and how many people you have seen walk up in front of a microphone and a camera look you in the eye and say well if we did these things we wouldnt have this debt they are not telling you the truth all those together are only 3 hours of borrowing and lets see if i remember correctly theres like what 24 hours in a day im looking for some honest discussion about the other 21 hours a day youve got to go back to those first boards that i put up and have an honest discussion about entitlements about the mandatory spending because they are what are exploding on us they are what are consuming us as a people we can do this we can save the future for our kids and our grandkids we can make sure that these programs exist but we have to do it rationally and we have to for once do it honestly factbased maybe someone actually holding a calculator because the rhetoric around here the political folklore around here when they are willing to look you in the eyes and base their whole world on something that only buys you 3 hours of borrowing a day you are not being told the truth we try to add literally two to four slides a week we are engaging in a little project we are a freshman office but we have some very smart young people who are very good with their calculators and we are trying very hard to find a way to make these gigantic numbers digestible so we can all understand them so we can have a rational conversation of how we save our country if you will go to schweikert house gov you are going to find a number of these slides as a matter of fact all of them are on there and every week i promise you there are going to be more coming and maybe if we all start to tell each other the truth about the math we can actually tell the truth about how we are going to save the country with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0008420615340583026, 0.0008420615340583026, 0, "thank you for the opportunity to address the house on the issue of the keystone xl pipeline there are pipe dreams and pipelines out there that people talk about apparently when it comes to jobs maybe the pipeline is apparently a pipe dream we have an opportunity in this country to secure our energy future with north american energy to create american jobs on a project that is a 1 700milelong pipeline you know i hear all the time from constituents in colorado about hey whats the deal with this pipeline why cant we get forward moving creating jobs american energy independence using north americas great resources to help our country create jobs and a more secure energy future and the conversation then really revolves around commonsense ideas heres a president who the president has said in the past that we need to support shovelready projects that the stimulus bill that passed in 2009 was all about shovelready projects and if you go back to last summer i believe the president had said well i guess shovelready wasnt as shovelready as we thought it was well heres a shovelready project here is a pipeline a privately funded pipeline thats ready to be built 1 700 miles 20 000 american jobs we could get started on that today its been years since this pipeline was actually firstthe permit process first started and yet here we are waiting once again this isnt a surprise to anybody it shouldnt shock anybody that the issue of the pipeline came up the bill that we passed in december said youve got to make a decision the president has said he would make a decision and yet we still have no decision i find it difficult to understand what is really the tough part of this decision we can create jobs right now with a truly shovelready project earlier this year back in february actually back in february of last year we had testimony before the energy and commerce committee that talked about the development of the alberta oil sands and what it would mean to jobs in the united states now the keystone pipeline is part of that according to the testimony we received in that committee between 2011 and 2015 6 000 jobs could be created in colorado alone because of the development of the alberta oil sands the fourth congressional district of colorado that i represent has two counties when you look at the true unemployment rates the unemployment rates that take into account people who have just given up workwhove given up looking for work who have just decided that they cant find work so theyve stopped looking two counties in my district have over 19 percent unemployment when you look at it through the lens of people who have stopped looking for work a project like the keystone pipeline 20 000 direct jobs 100 000 jobs indirectly created development of the alberta oil sands creating 6 000 jobs in colorado over the next 3 years next 4 years these are goodpaying american jobs with north american energy that we could be putting to the benefit of this country we know there are willing partners out there we know there are other people who have said go ahead well take the business well partner with you were not afraid china has more than once said that this is something that they would look at canada has made it very clear that they wont just stop if we say no shovelready projects here it is our opportunity to create american jobs three years ago the application was filed to build the pipeline most americans at town meetings that i attend they all know about this pipeline they know where its going they know whats happening with it its been our goal in this 112th congress to look out for the economy to advance projects that make sense when it comes to american energy and north american energy and american job creation that ought to be the goal of every single one of us in this congress every action we take should be looked at through the same lens that we look at the keystone pipelinecreating jobs im continuously awed at the energy resources that we have in north america and how simple it would be to advance policies that would make us more energy independent and yet we still cant move forward because no decision has been made im baffled at how difficult this administration has made it when it comes to weaning ourselves off of overseas oil while at the same time creating more jobs right here at home the administration has done everything it can to stand in the way of a project that can help americans get back to work a 7 billion private sector infrastructure project when construction jobs around colorado around this country have been some of the hardest hit by the recession this project provides a lifeline to thousands of construction workers seeking ways to get back on their feet but the inaction of this administration has led us down a path of insecurity and dependence on other countries that have great animosity towards us its simply unacceptable not only do we have the resources in our own backyard in north america but we have the ability to utilize friendly and willing neighbors like canada to import that oil our unemployment rate as a nation has hovered around 9 percent for far too long theres no reason that the federal government should not be supporting a private sector solution done with private capital at a time like this with rising gas prices the threat of the strait of hormuz being blocked and unemployment hovering so high we simply cannot afford not to act the president has had plenty of time to make a decision the studies have been submitted the conversations have taken place the debate has occurred but whats winning this debate is the fact that the american people understand how many jobs would be created with the north american energy project i yield back my time and thank you for the opportunity

h r 1230 the restarting american offshore leasing now act both under a structured rule with many amendments all of which are democrat amendments having been made in order this is a very fair rule i commend the sponsor of the two bills the chairman of the natural resources committee mr hastings of washington for his leadership in bringing both of these bills to the house h r 1229 is a bill that goes to the heart of the bureaucratic delays which are preventing the approval of drilling permits within the gulf of mexico and it modifies the standards and procedures governing federal leases and permits in order to streamline the process making the development of these domestic resources a reality instead of the status quo of paying lip service to drilling and then stifling drilling through bureaucratic inaction h r 1230 is a bill that would direct the sale of oil and gas leases within the outer continental shelf reversing a failed administration policy of canceling and delaying those processes over the last 2 years many republicans have come to this floor and have sung the same refrain of show us the jobs it was indeed a nice song and a catchy tuneso catchy that the minority of today seems to have been picking up on that kind of song as well i dont expect to hear that today or at least we ought not to hear it today because the two bills before us under this rule are real bills that create real jobs for people unlike the bills we have seen over the past couple of years which have led us to a situation where today there are twice as many workers in the government as there are in all of manufacturing in this nation which is an exact reverse of the situation this nation was in in 1960 these are not going to be government jobs which attack the taxpayers and suck the money out of their wallets to fund them these are going to be real jobs that grow the private sector that expand the economy that provide wealth and that will provide actually millions of new government revenues coming into this country the situation we find ourselves in today with regard to energy is one that is detrimental to everybody everyone who goes to the pump to fill their cars recognizes the cost is increasing and will continue to increase they recognize that the situation we are in puts all our jobs in jeopardy and it is because of the inaction of this particular administration the president has continually said that he wants to do action to move forward to develop american energy but the actions of his administration have quite frankly failed to meet the rhetoric of the administration the problem has always been a fundamental flaw in our nations energy plan last may the deepwater horizon accident occurred which was a tragedy and we must thank all of those who helped to solve that particular problem but unfortunately the administrations response to that tragedy has turned it into a catastrophe and one which destroys jobs immediately a moratorium on all sorts of development was put into place prior to that moratorium being put into place there were 52 approved and pending permits and that moratorium was lifted in october but of those 52 only 10 permits have been issued since that time two of them are new in deepwater and are eight of the 52 that were originally done that means there are over 40 still approved and still stalled in what has become a de facto moratorium caused by a footdragging of this administration that what one columnist said is moving at a glacial pace more rigs have left our shore12to go to other places in the world where they are welcomed and where they are developing energy sources where they dont have to face the red tape and the footdragging than have actually been approved by this administration a perfect example is seahawk drilling a company that had over 500 jobs and 20 rigs that went into chapter 11 bankruptcy the president of that company stated only one reason for that bankruptcy and that loss of jobs which was the de facto moratorium of inaction done by this administration in this area in 2008 in a response to an arbitrary drilling ban that was lifted by both the president and congress it created a 5year plan virginia was supposed to start the exploration process in 2011 but the secretary of the interior delayed that until 2012 and then later delayed all exploration on the atlantic coast until after 2017 in the gulf of mexico two other sales were canceled and moved out from this year which was when they were supposed to begin once again into next year it became so bad that a judge in new orleans gave the administration 30 days to start moving on these projects saying that what was happening by this administration was increasingly inexcusable and that not acting at all is not a lawful action the result of this has simply been catastrophic for jobs in america the obama administration has admitted in its official memorandum that for those days of its official moratorium 12 000 jobs were lost but what is more significant is the de facto moratorium there an lsu study simply said if this were sustained for 18 months in the gulf area there would be 24 532 jobs lost and in the nation 36 137 jobs lost simply because of what we are not doing in the gulf of mexico it is very simple to understand how this works each platform that is out there drilling has 90 to 150 employees if you add the production team as well as the exploration team you can multiply that by a factor of four so you have almost per every drilling up to 1 400 jobs that are tied to that particular project with 1 800 a week as the average wage that means for every one of those drills that is not put back into production it is 5 million to 10 million per month per platform that is lost to this economy and the ripple effect within the economy for our energy uses as well as jobs is once again staggering as this administration is indeed going at a glacial pace in virginia alone 2 000 jobs will be estimated to be lost if the de facto moratorium that pushes everything to 2017 is allowed to take place now this action or inaction by the administration costs every american it costs us at the gas pump as we see the cost of running our cars increasing almost daily and this hurts the poor worse than anyone else it is estimated that every american will pay 700 more this year for gasoline than least year obviously those at the lower end of the economic scale are the ones who are hurt the most for every cent that is increased in gas at the pump that is 1 billion that is taken out of household incomes in this country and it makes sure that americans are then put at the mercy of foreign oil development and foreign energy sources which may not necessarily like us and sometimes theyre just flat out bad guys it also has other areas in which it has affected everyoneonce again those at the lower end of the income scale the most for every dime that diesel goes up that is 400 million that is added to the agricultural industry which is what we eat which is tacked onto our food prices you have to have oil for fertilizer as that goes up the cost of fertilizer goes up the cost of running machinery goes up the cost of food goes up the cost of pharmaceuticals plastics if you go into the emergency room everything that is not metal has some element of oil that developed it and all of those are increasing now there are only two ways that we can handle this situation first you can go with the old concept of supply and demand and simply increase production which is what these two bills are trying to do or you can go to the approach that this administration seems to be asking us to do which is to cut our standard of living accept gasoline prices at the european level and beg saudi arabia to be nice to usto put our futures in the hands of opec and then amazingly say we can also solve these problems simply by taxing oil companies at a higher rate since 2010 the domestic production of energy in this country has decreased 16 percent in this year next year and the year after that we estimate unless we make changes that a quarter of a million barrels of oil will be decreased in our production rate in each of those years the only area in which any energy production has been increasing is on private property unfortunately for this country almost all of the energy that we have most of the energy that we can develop is on public lands which is controlled by the government which is doing nothing now to help develop that this is a time where pragmatism is much better than a failed ideology of restrictions now what these two bills do is to simply reverse the jobkilling delays that have been taking place in h r 1229 it reforms the law to require leaseholders to receive permits to drill before they start drilling and it will do it for the first time by law not simply by a regulation it demands that the secretary of the interior conduct and approve safety revenues once again for the first time in history more importantly it ends the de facto moratorium by demanding prompt guidelines and action it says that the secretary of the interior will have 30 days in which to deal with these issues and then can have up to two 15day extensionsa total of 60 days to do the review now while that may seem to some as a quick path its not when you look at the history of what has been done before the moratorium went into effect it was taking 5 to 15 days to do the drilling leases and permits one company was done in nine days just recently what the problem is is that most of these are simply not being done simply because of inaction it also says for those that were approved prior to the may 27 moratorium youve got 30 days to get them going again this is plenty of time to do the work it also does something else for the first time it provides an expedited hearing process so that legal rights are not lostthey are protectedbut you will not go back into a concept of a neverending lawsuit moratorium in 1230 the bill recognizes that this year will be the first time since 1958 that we have a possibility of no offshore lease sales and it wants to reverse that action to proceed promptly with the 5year plan so that things for example in virginia will be in effect within 1 year and those that were scheduled in the gulf can be done within 1 year of the passage of this bill this bill simply will create billions in federal reserve revenues coming in and it will create billions in our economy and it will create jobs i hate to say this but under president obama the cost of energy has skyrocketed the administration has actively blocked and delayed energy production its cost jobs its raised energy prices its made the united states more reliant on unstable foreign countries for our energy through the american energy initiative this house is actively working to increase american energy production to lower gas prices to create american jobs to generate revenue to help reduce the deficit and to decrease our dependence on foreign energy the united states government has had a long history of sporadic attempts to respond to oil and gas prices usually we have missed the mark but unfortunately oil is still the lifeblood of the world and will be for most of our lives that is why 70 countries and 31 states in the united states are involved in the process prices are influenced by the signals that are given by worldwide circumstances and also by government policy these two bills are the first of several signals that this house wants to send to the world and to the economy that says our goal should be to come as close to economic and energy selfsufficiency and independence as possible we are not an energypoor nation and we need to be developing the resources in every way possible including in the gulf including in the outer continental shelf and including on our land sources that is our future if we want to do anything to create jobs and help the american people that is specifically what these two bills are aimed to do with such this is a good rule and a fair rule and the underlying piece of legislation is entirely worthy of our support i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0008451072499155998, 0.0008451072499155998, 0, "a couple of issues i want to address i appreciate so much my friend dr fleming who has the adjoining district to mine across the sabine river over in louisiana he makes great points we need to get the federal government out of the business of controlling peoples health care we need to get them back in the business of being a referee making sure insurance companies and health care providers do the right thing butt out of the business of dictating and controlling health care very clear from obamacare the ipab we got a board of 15 people going to dictate peoples medical decisions for them and of course all of the pandering back during the debate on obamacare how you can as my friend dr fleming pointed out the president all those who mirror his comments all those that read from the same teleprompter and say oh no you like your health care you can keep it you like your doctor you can keep it well we knew they were wrong they were wrong so most people have already lost their health care exactly as they had it before if they liked it and if they havent yet they will thats why it was a good idea not only to repeal the provision on that board that will dictate peoples lives what health care they can have what they cant have that was a good idea we need to repeal the whole bill it is unconstitutional and of course the president did us a wonderful favor by showing what many of us knew that if obamacare is considered constitutionalits not but if the courts considered it that waythen it is very clear the president believes and i think under the bill he has the authority to step on suppress override peoples individual liberties and freedoms we were assured by our founders that we were endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights among those life liberty and the pursuit of happiness well obamacare modifies that to the extent that you can have life liberty and pursuit of happiness only if it meets with the approval of the administration in power and the people theyve put on ipab and what they have to say about whether youre too old to have a treatment whether or like the president said in one of his town halls to a lady that said will you at least consider the quality of life on people like my mother and whether she could get a pacemaker since shed lived for 10 years with the pacemaker and he said ultimately you know maybe were just better off telling your mother just take a pain pill the part that he didnt say is take the pain pill and die dont live 10 years because thats what obamacare will do for us so hopefully the supreme court justices that will take this up and consider it will also realize that since obamacare gives the president the power to override the constitution and prohibit the free exercise of religionim baptist but obviously it does clearly restrict the free exercise of individual catholics of catholic institutions and thats because the president says so because obamacare gives him the power to do that i hope that the supreme court justices will take note of that they could take judicial notice of what has been publicly done and by order and take note of the fact that since our freedom of religion is clearly expressed in the first part of the first amendment and its there in black and white the governments not to prohibit the free exercise of religion and since the privacy rights as the supreme court has come to call them are not written in the constitution they were somehow found in the shadow of a penumbra somewhere and gee if obamacare gives the president the power to override peoples constitutional rights for rights that are put in stated words in the constitution then its certainly going to give some redneck president down the road the right to just say you know what the privacy rights arent even there and so were setting those aside too just like i set aside catholics and other religious beliefs now we have the power to set aside a right thats not even mentioned in the constitution and it ought to scare every thinking liberalwe wont get the ones that dont thinkbut every thinking liberal ought to have that go to their core and give them goose bumps oh my goodness i didnt think about some redneck person possibly gettingbecomingpresident because at some point the american people are going to get so fed up with having washington dictate all of their individual decisions that they may just elect the biggest redneck they can get and because the supreme court if it were to do the unthinkable and rule obamacare as constitutional then the administration will have not only a right they will have a duty to dictate to people how they can live because if the federal government has the right under the constitution to control all our health care putting some providers out of business picking winners and losers telling who gets a pain pill who gets a pacemaker if they have the right to do that the government has a duty to tell every person how they can live were told that the federal government if it wanted to could look at every debit purchase every credit card purchase i mean i got in this discussion with some government attorneys back before i ever got to congress and they were saying look if banks have the right to review all of your banking records why shouldnt the government i explained because the government can put us in jail and a bank cant thats why there are protections against the government but obamacare will give the government control of our health care and therefore at some point it will only make sense that they live up to their duty to say you know what of course under obamacare the federal government will have every persons health care records it becomes the repository for everyones most private information about their lives theres nothing in mine im worried about but it is quite bothersome to think that there is nothing that can be private from the federal government once they have all of everybodys health care records well if theyve got everybodys health care records wouldnt it make sense at some point down the road to say you know what youre costing us too much money youre not living properly and we noted that in your health care records youve got a 280 cholesterol level and then we noticed you went to the grocery store and bought a pound of bacon this weekend so were going to have to change your health care change the charges folks that is a reasonable conclusion of where obamacare has to take us if its ruled constitutional its got to stop one other thing i want to mention its been reported today in a couple of places one in my friend breitbarts online news blurb from a w r hawkins another is from the washington post two different ends of the spectrum perhaps theyre both reporting the same thing that this administration through secretary hillary clinton is going to announce that it could care less what congress has ordered about helping the enemies of israel about helping those who are terrorizing and persecuting christians in egypt and destroying churches and eliminating freedom of religion and are saying they want to rethink their peace accord with israel and setting themselves up to be the enemy of israel and now this administration knowing that congress passed a law that says you cant give people money in egypt unless you can certify to certain factsand they cannot not honestly if they do so now with what we know publicly we know they will not be honest in doing so and theyre going to give 1 5 billion not in humanitarian aid according to this story not foodmilitary aid so forget all of those speeches that this president gave at aipac oh gosh were israels best friend were going to help them because oh no were going to give people who have the power to destroy israel on the border with israel military aid as they are planningmany there make it clear they hate israel they hate us and ive said over and over we dont have to pay people to hate us theyll do it for free we have to quit funding the enemy of us and the enemy of our friends this is insane and i hope somewhere in this administration is a cooler head that will say mr president madam secretary israel is our friend remember the speeches youve both given about what a friend they are and its time that we do not provide military aid abetting and assistance to people that want to destroy christians that want to destroy israelis and that want to put the world in turmoil and have everyone living exactly as they dictate we want to keep some freedoms here and in israel and the way to do that is not to fund and provide military assistance to anyone unless we know they are our friend theyre israels friend theyre the friends of our friends to do otherwise will bring calamity on this country like they will not realize until its too late with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0008488601306453347, 0.0008488601306453347, 0, "i yield myself the balance of my time the american people have sent us here to tell the truth and the truth is that there are too many government programs that do not work and actually make things worse these government programs are paid for by the american people you can say that its not from the treasury or that its from the treasury that its from tarp its not from tarp but the fact remains that it is from the american taxpayer in fact the gentleman at one time said it comes out of the treasury then he said it comes from tarp but the promise in 2008 was that it would go back to the american people it would go back in the national treasury in fact it does not i will address where it goes and i think the american people when they find out where it goes under this program theyre going to be even more upset i dont think theyll be surprised because i think theyve come to realize that theres not a lot of will in washington to protect them the taxpayers the american people already know that there are too many ineffective government programs that cost too much and this is a poster child for those programs if you cant cut this program im not sure you can cut any and when we find such programs we as the representatives of the people have a duty and a responsibility to the taxpayers to end these programs thats what we are doing this morning were going to end this program thats what were here for in this legislation by the gentleman from texas we stop a 1 billion failed spending program now its a wellintentioned program but just as the road to hell is paved with good intentions so is the road to higher deficits and recordbreaking debt a debt that our children and our grandchildren will have to pay you know when we talk about the taxpayers ultimately fund this program when we borrow at 42 cents out of every dollar its our children and our grandchildren that will have to pay for these programs were charging something and were telling them to pay the bill today we have an unthinkable debt of 14 trillion a debt that imposes a birth tax on every child born in america its 45 000 today just last year it was 35 000 its grown by 10 000 even worse this debt or birth tax is growing every day because our government is spending some days 5 billion some days 8 billion more than it takes in and adding to what our children and grandchildren will have to pay one question that the american people often confront is are they better off than their parents and will their children be better off than they are and their grandchildren its interesting that in survey after survey or poll after poll the american people say were better off than our parents our parents fought for our freedom they preserved it in numerous wars they saved their money they watched their money they worked hard and they left us in good shape but when that same question is a little different question do you think your children or grandchildren will be better off the american people know they instinctively know no is the answer sadly and thats because of our national debt and our deficit in fact both the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and secretary robert gates have said that its a national security problem our debt threatens our very existence as a country this washington spending binge is driving our country right off a cliff weve seen the effect of overspending on our economy today the government absorbs so much money from our citizens that its hard to create private jobs each dollar out of the economy is a job that the private sector cant create now actually president reagan and president clinton both realized this and they grew the economy those were the only two years with a growing economy and government spending either level or going down thats the only time in our country we had a surplus they both realized that it was the private sector that would see us out of this this growth in the federal government and in its spending is hampering job creation and thats what these homeowners need they need a job lets look at this program this is from the obama administration this is their budget that was just filed here is what the american people need to know what does this program do it offers a loan of up to 50 000 to pay all arrearages to homeowners on their first mortgage fifty thousand dollars and then to pay up to 24 consecutive months of mortgage payments 24 months of their mortgage payment both the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from massachusetts kept talking about the large financial institutions thats who is owed the money in fact were not getting this money from the large financial institutions just the contrary were paying them because theyre the ones that hold this mortgage so when the taxpayers write a 50 000 check under this program to pay arrearages on the mortgage who do you think it goes to it goes to bank of america it goes to morgan chase it goes to citigroup its shocking that the gentleman from massachusetts would actually say that this money is coming from the very institutions that are going to receive this money this billion dollars is not going to homeowners its going to these large financial institutions he says theyre the ones that ought to be paying this not the homeowners or not the taxpayers we always thought the homeowners were supposed to pay their mortgages but i think we could all agree that its not the taxpayer its just an astounding thing he says that if flip wilson told us to vote for something we would but it wasnt flip wilson it was ron kirk and what did he tell us if i were chairman frank i would talk about anything but this failed program i think thats why theyve talked about everything but this failed program it was ron kirk that told us that our automobile sector would suffer that our pharmaceutical sector would suffer he said that this would cost jobs in medical equipment electronics textiles wheat fruit nuts cotton he did include cotton he said 60 billion worth of exports were at risk well do the math 7 000 jobs for each 1 billion worth of exports thats 420 000 jobs so do you want to vote against something that would put 420 000 americans out of jobs and then they would all line up for another government program that the minority would design the other thingand this is the last thing ill say they keep saying that the taxpayers will get paid back well let me introduce this this is from the obama administration this is their same budget for fiscal year 2012 it estimates the losses on this program and they have accused us of making up these figures 97 72 thats the loss on this program 98 cents out of every dollar its time to end this failed

the recovery summer this was supposed to be a 6weeklong push to highlight what the obama administration said would be jobs created last summer by a surge in federal stimulus spending across the country senior adviser to the president david axelrod said this summer will be the most active recovery act season yet with thousands of highly visible road bridge water and other infrastructure projects breaking ground across the country giving the american people a firsthand look at the recovery act in their own backyards and making it crystal clear what the cost would have been of doing nothing yet the only thing that is crystal clear to the majority of americans is that there is nothing to show from the democrats failed economic policies that have set our country on a road to ruin since president obama has taken office he has done absolutely nothing to promote american energy production he has done nothing to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business owners he has done nothing to fix the tax code to help job creators he has done nothing to increase competitiveness for american manufacturers and he has done nothing to pay down americas unsustainable debt burden and bring back confidence among investors and entrepreneurs by supporting longterm american economic growth and now president obama is selling the sequel to last years recovery summer sales pitch and kicking off this summer by trying to convince the american people that 28 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent is just a bump in the road to recovery in addition a number of democrats are calling for billions more in taxpayer dollars to be spent on yet another wasteful stimulus to create jobs but americans arent buying it unemployment is nowhere near the 6 8 percent level at which the administration claimed it would be today if the stimulus was signed into law when americas promise prosperity and security for future generations are at stake this cannot be brushed off as just a bump in the road it is a mountain of constraint put in place by a litany of failed democrat policies and unfulfilled promises and whats worse is that president obama recently laughed off the fact that his stimulus projects which are costing taxpayers trillions of dollars have failed to live up to their promise to create new jobs democrats promised this would be the summer of recovery but their conflicting assessment of the economy and their doubletalk has left american families wondering is this a joke well most economists and the american people are not laughing their concern is growing and confidence in president obamas economic policies is plunging more and more every day and the idea of another stimulus bill is dead on arrival in the house in the face of the greatest economic crisis since the great depression this administration and the democrats in congress are choosing to play politics with economic recovery and continue with another round of empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises in their desperate sales pitch again this summer house republicans are serious about creating real american jobs and were making it our mission to put americans back to work we know that what we need are commonsense policies that will create jobs in this country immediately we cannot let this administration have another frivolous shot at the wasteful spending of taxpayers hardearned dollars or be given more regulatory power or allowed to spin its way out of the catastrophic economy the democrats have created with empty phrases like recovery summer house republicans have produced a progrowth projob creation budget as well as a real plan for americas job creators both plans will put the nation on a fiscally sustainable path to restore confidence lower tax rates and allow america to remain competitive in the global economy we want to take the burden of regulation off of our job creators and produce more american energy so that americans can start receiving the paychecks that they need and deserve and we want to reduce the hostility of the federal governments regulators toward american business both small and large we cannot allow this outoftouch administration to continue with their failed experiments and silly punchlines we cannot allow washington democrats to tax and spend away the futures of our children and our grandchildren we cannot continue down the road to ruin coming from the private sector to congress i know that america can and will become prosperous beyond imagination and millions of new private sector jobs will be created if we would just get back to our founding free market principles and end big government and wasteful spending it is time we take a different road this summer we cannot continue on the misguided and irresponsible path endorsed by the other side of the aisle of higher taxes reckless spending bigger government explosive debt crippling regulation higher deficits and unacceptably high unemployment eightyone percent of americans know somebody without a job as a matter of fact if youd look at the unemployment rate that includes underemployed and unemployed almost one out of every five americans is unemployed or underemployed today under president obamas watch almost 40 000 jobs have been lost every 2 weeks president obamas socalled stimulus was signed into law 28 months ago and there are nearly 2 million fewer americans with jobs today they have had their chance to make things right last summer and it has not worked now it is our turn these are undoubtedly tough times and i want to continue the great american legacy of leaving our children better off than we ourselves are it pains me to know that only 17 percent of the mothers in this country believe that their children will be better off in the future it doesnt have to be this way there has not been a more important time in our nations history to realign our principles and policies in light of current economic reality as

inaction by this administration to discourage energy projects energy production that would lower the price of gas here at home these are americans that are scared they simply dont have the money in their pocket in their budget to pay for these high prices 60 to fill up a tank of gas 80 to fill up the tank of gas i find it increasingly more difficult to explain to my constituents from rural colorado why this government isnt advancing policies that will bring down the prices at the pump it pains me the look on peoples faces when they tell me that theyre making 10 an hour and are paying upwards of 4 for a gallon of gas what are they supposed to do stop going to work because gas is so expensive we are facing a significant crisis and its a travesty its a shame my colleagues here tonight are here to say we will not stand for it how do i go back home this weekend to explain to my constituents why gas prices have risen 1 80 per gallon since this president took office how do i explain that this administration may be willing to tap the strategic petroleum reserve which is only to be used when there is a severe energy supply disruption instead of opening up more land for exploration which brings me to my next point this administration alleges that it has opened up vast amounts of our lands for leasing in fact just a few days ago on february 23 at the university of miami i quote under my administration america is producing more oil today than at any other time in the last 8 years this is simply false a false telling of reality while it may be true that new production is occurring on private lands where the president cant involve his antienergy administration federal lands and offshore development is far below what it has been in previous years let me cite to you some very startling statistics according to an article on e d on monday just a few days ago production of natural gas on public lands and waters in fiscal year 2011 dropped 11 percent from 2010 thats a drop of 11 percent on public lands and waters in fiscal year 2011 oil production on federal lands dropped 14 percent since last year and this reduction was most significant in the gulf which declined by 17 percent since 2010 according to a wall street journal editorial from the other day drilling plans have historically been approved 73 percent of the time since the beginning of 2012 the president has only approved 23 percent approval of an offshore drilling plant typically takes about 92 days right now thats 31 days over average in 2000 just 12 years ago 32 percent of our oil was from federal lands why in 2010 that number shrank to 19 percent of total unitedstates production let me say that again in 2000 32 percent of our oil was from federal lands in 2010 that number shrank to 19 percent of total unitedstates production we arent opening up our federal lands for development and thats the reason for the significant drop the total onshore acreage leased under this administration in 2009 and 2010 is the lowest in over 20 years the president has claimed that he is opening up new offshore areas for production and more land for leases again this is false many of these lease sales were already scheduled to take place before he even took office one was even cancelled for a year by the administration and is now being reinstated his plan even closes the majority of the ocs to new energy production through the year in recent days and months we have seen the president touting an alloftheabove energy approach but his actions speak louder than his words and they do not promote an alloftheabove energy strategy this administration has blocked energy production on federal lands and decreased overall domestic energy production across the board and i want to share with you just a few of these examples tonight we are joined by the house energy action team a group of members from across the country who are dedicated to sharing with their constituents in this country the policies that we have passed in this house with bipartisan support to encourage energy production to make sure that we are increasing and encouraging natural gas development oil developments all of our natural resources in a true alloftheabove energy strategy the heat action team the house energy action team is once again sharing that strategy and contrasting ourselves with the strategy that this president has presented over the past 3 years of his administration so the president can claim all he wants to be supportive of an alloftheabove energy strategysaid it just a few months ago from this podium right behind me in the state of the union address supporting an alloftheabove energy strategybut lets actually talk lets actually talk about what the presidents policies have resulted in on oil and gas hes withdrawn oil leases from utah costing 3 000 jobs withdrew oil and gas leases from montana issued a moratorium on gulf drilling costing 12 000 jobs reinstated a ban on drilling off the entire pacific coast announced he would regulate hydraulic fracturing again the president claims to be a supporter of an alloftheabove energy policy but on coal he pulled a permit from a west virginia mine costing 250 jobs announced the merger of blm and osm which could move domestic coal one step closer to extinction in this country when it comes to nuclear energy this president has blocked uranium mining in arizona for 2 years he has personally abandoned the yucca mountain waste site jeopardizing the future of nuclear energy in this country imposed a 20year ban on uranium mining increasing our 90 percent already our 90 percent dependency on foreign sources even on renewable energy and this presidents green energy agenda this president has closed all but 2 percent of federal lands from renewable energy development hes left open only 670 000 of 30 million acres of land for solar development again the president claims he is for an alloftheabove energy strategy when in fact what we have seen is this president is actually for none of the above this charti know its impossible to readdetails the inaction of this administration in fact some very harmful actions to our energy policy where he has stopped delayed repealed energy production in this country again tonight we are going to be hearing from many members around the country to discuss

one modified open rule during the entire 111th congress the first underlying bill today h r 1216 continues the fulfillment of the republican pledge to america and illustrates that once again republicans are keeping our promises to the american people to cut federal spending the american people want transparency of washingtons spending of hardearned taxpayer dollars in an act of gross irresponsibility the federal government is spending 1 out of 4 of gross domestic product we hear the term federal money as though it is manna from heaven let me dispel that misconception the federal government has only the money it takes away from hardworking american families through taxes or the money it borrows as a nation we are currently borrowing 43 cents for every dollar spent at the federal level some argue that to balance the federal government and pay down our debt we should raise taxes as a fiscal conservative i have to disagree raising taxes on hardworking americans and job creators is simply a way to pass the blame we must rein in outofcontrol washington spending and put an end to it the american people are sick and tired of reckless government spending and washingtons disregard for basic budgeting principles of living within its means this is one of the many reasons i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill before us today h r 1216 restores congressional oversight to federal spending by ending the autopilot spending for physician residency programs at teaching health centers and restoring it to the annual appropriations process when a program is put on autopilot congress abdicates its authority to unelected bureaucrats and takes a handsoff approach house republicans are committed to ending that approach to federal spending and ensuring that government programs are accountable for how they are spending money no longer will we accept politically popular excuses each program must prove that it is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars if congress will not address outofcontrol spending now we are passing the buck to our children and grandchildren therefore i commend my republican colleagues at the house energy and commerce committee for seeking to end mandatory or autopilot funding for programs in the liberal democrats government takeover of health care because the liberal elites knew their government takeover of health care was unpopular and would likely have consequences at the ballot box they included 105 billion in mandatory taxpayer spending in the law itself to protect their favorite programs let me take a moment to explain the difference between discretionary and mandatory government spending discretionary spending is appropriated by congress annually and therefore subject to congressional oversight and review discretionary spending allows members of congress the opportunity to be wise stewards of the taxpayers money by not funding ineffective or duplicative programs on the contrary mandatory spending operates irrespective of congressional appropriations and must be spent whether we have the money or not the most recognized mandatory spending programs are medicare medicaid and social security which operate on autopilot and have not been subject to congressional oversight from year to year as funds automatically stream from the treasury to anyone who qualifies for a particular benefit it cannot be emphasized enough that the liberal elites in washington chose to hastily ram through their government takeover of health care with no regard for the staunch opposition of the american people the audacity of an elected official or worse an unelected bureaucrat basically saying to a taxpayer that he or she knows how to spend the taxpayers money better than the individual taxpayer is appalling that is what the ruling liberal elites in washington did when they chose to forgo the annual appropriations also known as oversight process by putting their favorite programs on autopilot under obamacare it is my firm belief that washington should not be in the business of picking winners and losers during committee consideration of the underlying bill my republican colleagues rightly pointed out that the liberal democrats in control last congress put the funding for residencies at teaching health centers on autopilot but left residency programs at childrens hospitals to fend for themselves in the annual appropriations process in fact president obamas fy 2012 budget proposes eliminating funding for residency programs at childrens hospitals it is hard to understand why residencies at teaching health centers should receive special treatment why were these residency programs protected while others languished and were eventually proposed to be eliminated this is a classic example of washington bureaucrats deciding which programs will win and which will lose as i said earlier every program should be properly scrutinized by congress through the appropriations process and be accountable for how it is spending taxpayer money while this accountability should always be important its even more critical because were facing the third straight year of trillion dollar deficits this fiscal year our deficit will be 1 6 trillion remember the figure i mentioned earlier about our nations borrowing habits were borrowing 43 cents of every dollar the federal government spends this translates to a national debt that has now reached more than 14 trillion and has gotten the attention of the american people if youre having a hard time visualizing 14 trillion let me put it this way if america was required to pay back its national debt right now each citizenman woman and childwould owe more than 46 000 the simple truth is that we have a spending crisis in this town due in large part to mandatory spending that operates on autopilot house republicans are committed to bringing government spending under control and were continuing to build on our pledge to america by restoring congressional oversight and accountability for government programs again i urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bills i reserve the balance of my

democratic budget drafted by mr chris van hollen and then of course the progressive caucus budget came up the black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me

proposed by epa in april of 2010 and finalized in february of 2011 many of us here know that when the boiler mact regulation was finalized epa asked for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time this epa boiler mact rule is far from perfect but the trouble is the bill we have before us today is even further from perfect because it doesnt just give epa time to reconsider the rule it tells epa they cant issue a new rule for at least 15 months but theres no deadline for final action further it practically rewrites sections 112 and 129 of the clean air act by eliminating the need for numeric emission limits for mact standards but perhaps the most egregious to me was section 3 of the bill it once again rewrites the clean air act the clean air act provides for 3 years for compliance with mact standards with the possibility of a 4th section 3 of this bill tells us to throw that out it tells us that for the boiler mact rule compliance cannot be required for at least 5 years however it then says to the epa administrator it gives the administrator the ability to establish compliance dates so depending on who the administrator is at the time these rules are finalized compliance could be required in 5 years in 10 years in 50 years in 105 years thats just unacceptable and thats why im offering this amendment today i support many of the things in this bill and i recognize the need for a reproposal of this rule but i dont support 5 years to infinity for compliance and so this amendment will simply require that we go back to the established compliance time lines in the clean air act it even gives the possibility for an additional year of compliance if a compelling reason is found i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and make this a bill that we can all support when it comes for final passage i yield back

our nations fisheries by superseding the regional fishery management council process set up by congress i live in the heart of a district where people have lost a tremendous amount of fish and are looking for ways to make sure that they have a fisheries industry to pass along to their children and grandchildren the sectors management system in maine has done that it has allowed innovative

do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment which is another manifestation of the so be it attitude of some in congress at the expense of many in our country"], [0.9939438300207257, 0.006056169979274273, 1, "i thank my friend and i thank my neighbor from pennsylvania as well its good to have a bipartisan discussion on an issue that is critical to this countryour energy independence and using our domestic reserves in pennsylvania we have a unique circumstance as does new york in that 4 million is invested in producing each marcellus shale well and with 2 500 wells produced annually just in pennsylvania were talking about 10 billion that is invested in marcellus shale sites thats money thats coming right back into pennsylvania thats money that would be coming back into new york if the gentleman had his way which i would support when we talk about natural gasand were going to get into the details and we have gotten into the details of marcellus shale in particular and what a great find this has been for the countrywe think about ways that we can use the natural gas that results from marcellus shale things like natural gaspowered vehicles were going to have a discussion later in the year on an energy bill here in this congressit will be a bipartisan billas natural gas is going to be a critical part of our nations energy future think about the great work that the scientists are doing on the research and development of natural gas vehicles on the production of natural gas vehicles on the purchasing and conversion in the country and on finding a way to give tax credits to consumers so they can convert their vehicles into natural gas operating then of course you have the chicken and the egg situation of whos going to go first do you have the filling station before you have the car or do you have the car before you have the filling station we have to do both together we have to incentivize the stations to put natural gas pumps at their stations and of course incentivize the conversion of the natural gas vehicle which helps all of us with the price of gas nearing and exceeding 4 in many states in the country this is only going to help with our energy future when you think about north america in particular this is so exciting because gas resources are much larger and the cost of producing gas is much lower because of the find of the marcellus shale if you are in a household in this country that doesnt get its electricity from natural gas your electricity bill is still going to be lower because of the resources that we have because of the abundance of natural gas were talking about cheap energy because of the volume that were talking about unprecedented reserves that exceed the oil under saudi arabia as the gentleman was discussing earlier the ability of the united states to store natural gas has improved dramatically over the years so now were in position where we can produce the gas we can use it domestically to bring down the cost of electricity we can store it and were going to export some of this gas as well the market for natural gas around the world is increasing because of the marcellus shale find in pennsylvania and in new york and west virginia and virginia ohio this is really a wonderful thing for this country and the total unitedstates natural gas production in 2010 just last year was at its highest level ever in 2010 the natural gas production in this country was at its highest level ever compared to oil consumption which since 2005 has dropped more than 5 percent and natural gas use has risen 10 percent in that time of course thats preceding the big find with the marcellus shale so were only going to see that grow and thrive so were keeping energy prices low were making ourselves energy independent which is critical theres a national security issue to that theres an economic and a jobs issue which were seeing in pennsylvania firsthand and of course theres an energy issue to that how were going to continue to grow our energy resources so i congratulate the gentleman for leading the discussion tonight and i look forward to continuing not just tonight but beyond because this has to be part of our energy future in this country and it was the cover of time magazine so when you think about the nation paying attention the spotlight being on our region of the country it truly is because this is something thats going to benefit everybody in this country"], [0.9936298173852265, 0.006370182614773512, 1, "and mr hoyerall

upon a number of factors including growing access to foreign markets these agreements do that foreign goods enter our country under few restrictions but around the world our products face product tariffs and other prohibitive barriers to trade the current situation is neither free nor fair trade this changes that the barriers are against our products this reduces and eliminates those barriers the pending agreements will allow american products to better compete globally and drive job creation here at home thats why i support these agreements perhaps no industry stands to gain more than agriculture throughout america and especially in california the number one agricultural state in the nation passage of these agreements with south korea means americangrown raisins asparagus almonds
