his comments and i think that we have to confront the fact that we are in a crisis of transition that we are in a period where some things are working and other things are failing that when the things that are working do succeed that they are either ignored or downplayed or laughed at that when gasoline prices drop they are little noticed but when we have 3 percent annual inflation rates rates which in 1980 would have been thought impossible which any candidate who would have offered them would have been laughed out of the race when we have in january and again in february 3 percent annual rates of inflation little is said about the positive side and so the american people much like a football team that is reminded of every fumble and not rewarded for every play that succeeds are confused disspirited and all of us wonder where then do we go i think that we have to confront the fact that while we are beginning to succeed with inflation we have hard work to do that interest rates must come down and that interest rates can come down if the deficit of the federal government is reduced let me note again that it is possible to change things that our constitution does in fact work that three times last yearon the first budget resolution on the reconciliation bill and on the tax cutsin 15minute intervals which is how this house votes we decisively changed the future of america and the future of the liberal welfare state and yet in each case it took the will of the people making themselves felt through their representatives to change things that while things can happen they can hardly happen during pro forma sessions and they can hardly happen when people are not heard but there are only two ways to reduce deficits and bring down interest rates we must either raise taxes or we must lower spending now the country has clarly spoken in california in proposition 13 the country said cut spending do not raise taxes in massachusetts in proposition 2 the country said cut spending do not raise taxes in 1980 in the elections the country said cut spending do not raise taxes in most of the national polls the country by a margin of 80 to 12 says cut spending do not raise taxes again and again the american people say the liberal welfare state has failed we recognize intuitively the average american intuitively could not cite the 1978 figure of 448 billion or the 1982 figure of 725 billion but there is an intuitive deep instinct that says government in washington has grown and grown and grown and it cannot continue that rather than reach into my pocket and pay more in taxes it is time for the government to reach into its pocket and spend less yet even though the most reliable national surveys indicate that 80 percent 4 out of 5 americans want to cut spending that only 12 percent barely 1 out of 10 want to raise taxes it is the 12 percent who dominate this congress it is the 12 percent who defend the liberal welfare state and the fact is that every liberal welfare state interest group has spokesmen in this building and in this room there is a term here in washington to explain this behavior we have what are called iron triangles literally a little triangle one side of it is a private interest group one side of it is a legislative committee or subcommittee and one side is a federal agency an obvious one for example is farmers through their various farm associations the agriculture committee and the department of agriculture it is called an iron triangle because it is as hard to break as a piece of iron historically under the liberal welfare state policy was made by building a majority of triangles if you had enough little triangles backing you you won the key votes every liberal welfare state interest group has paid staff on or near this hill every liberal welfare state interest group has congressmen it has elected newsmen it has nurtured people who understand its language its programs and its interests in a sense when ronald reagans steak goes into a liberal welfare state triangle it comes out as hamburger no matter how good the idea was to begin with by the time the special interests of the liberal welfare state get done tearing it apart by the time they get done exposing every detail by the time they slant their questions and their code words it ends up being torn to shreds the transition from a liberal welfare state to a conservative opportunity society is in fact precisely being hung up by the sheer power of the iron triangles of the liberal welfare state and the power of their leadership representing that 12 percent minority to hang tough in this building for tax increases rather than cutting spending news media coverage is frankly sometimes distorted but more often it is simply uninformed or unfocused all too often the new ideas the new terms the new leaders are outside the cocktail party circuit of the liberal news media all too often newsmen and newswomen who grew up and went to liberal colleges who have read liberal books who understand liberal code words and have friends who work for liberal interest groups simply find it easier to cover a story and report only the version of truth seen by their liberal friends it is easier to cover old ideas old terms and old leaders so it is harder for those of us who are spokesmen for the conservative opportunity society to communicate than it i for the traditional leadership of the liberal welfare state they hold the commanding heights of tradition of committee of staff they dominate the calendar they can decide which witnesses to call which day to hold the hearings and how to focus those hearings so the defenders of the liberal welfare state continue to do nothing in this building while hoping that their allies in the iron triangles of the liberal welfare state will slowly and steadily chew up the reagan program they believe that a strategy of inaction while it will lead american business to fall lead american workers to be unemployed will lead to pain across america that that strategy of inaction is good for the liberal welfare state and their allies not only are they following a strategy of inaction a strategy of playing golf instead of working at government a strategy of taking recesses instead of getting the job done they have the gall to then claim that it is ronald reagan who is responsible for the mess now al smith a former governor of new york a great democrat a candidate for president had a saying he used to say lets look at the record and so let us take the charge that it is ronald reagans mess and let us look at the record in 1952 when the most prominent liberal democratic leader was first elected to the congress ronald reagan was making movies in 1954 when the most prominent liberal democratic leader became part of the majority ronald reagan had gone to g e theater in the 1960s when the most prominent liberal democratic leader joined the rules committee ronald reagan was retired thinking about running for office in the early 1970s when the most prominent liberal democratic leader had become majority leader ronald reagan was governor of california let us look at 1978 when this chart begins when the average gross pay was 189 and the federal government was at 448 billion ronald reagan was retired doing a radio show making speeches but the liberl leadership of this congress was aleady in place they were already on the path that would destroy 21 of your takehome pay they were already on the path that would create a 0percent increase in the federal budget and yet they say oh no it was that retired man in california who is responsible in 1980 when ronald reagan was campaigning the track was clear our real takehome pay was collapsing the liberal welfare state was continuing to accelerate becoming an avalanche of programs of redtape of red ink of highinterestproducing deficits and yet they have the gall to turn having controlled this congress for 26 years and with a straight face having run this house for a generation it is hard to believe but i was 11 years old when the speaker of this house and his party took control and yet i and my party are responsible for the mess when i was in high school the speaker of this house and his party ran the congress and yet it is my party that is responsible when i first went off to college the speaker of this house and his party were already running huge deficits but it is my partys fault i would suggest that we have seldom seen such a total abdication of the responsibility of the citizen as we are seeing in the liberal democratic leadership today in their willingness to blame a man who was in california for the problems they created and a willingness to blame a party that is still in the minority for the problems they have developed and i do not think it will work i do not think they can blame ronald reagans golf at the nearest country club the country does not have that short a memory but if those who are in power will not do anything what can we do if they go off and hide what recourse do we have in this sense i believe the american people may turn to good advantage the easter recess the work period that will bring many members back home for there are three steps we can take the first step is to force a vote to require a vote on a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget why is that important why do we need a constitutional solution let me tell my colleagues a story as the congressman from georgia i watched many mayors of atlanta our most recent mayor now retired was maynard jackson a great liberal democrat an advocate of the poor a spokesman for the liberal welfare state a man who in 8 years as mayor of atlanta never ran a deficit not once not a penny why because in the 1930s the city of atlanta adopted a rule that said if the mayor runs a deficit he must pay it out of his personal pocket therefore mayors of atlanta are very conservative with the peoples money the current mayor of atlanta is andrew young again a great liberal an advocate of the liberal welfare state spokesman for the poor a spokesman for public programs and i wager a bet now that mayor young will not run a deficit in the years he is privileged to serve as mayor that he will fiscally be more conservative than ronald reagan why because there is an institutional requirement that he will have to pay out of his own pocket if he runs a deficit governor carter as governor of georgia never ran a deficit because it is illegal under the georgia constitution yet preiident carter as president piled ap enough red ink to give us 21percent interest rates and 14percent inflation a constitutional amendment allows us to force discipline on the congress and the president it will signal to the interest rate market that we are going to bring spending under control and the passage of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget by itself would be a major step toward having that kind of change that is why i favor the conablejenkinshatch bill or a similar bill to require a constitutional amendment that would give the american people the security that government spending in the future will be controlled h 1416 co second we must cut spending this congress in the next few months will have a chance to choose between the path of the 12 percent to raise taxes and the path of the 80 percent to cut spending it is our job to sit down and line by line item by item prune the federal budget if you have been laid off recently you have to look at your family budget you have to talk to your children about what their plans were for the summer you have to look at their allowance you have to look at the food budget people who are laid off cannot just pass big deficits and hope the bank will honor their checks if you are a small businessman or business woman and your business is right you have got to sit down and look at every penny you are spending only if you are the federal government can you spend and pass big deficits and i think we must face the same discipline we must undergo the same process as every american in bringing our spending under control so in the next few months it is our job to pass a budget that does bring down the deficit by cutting spending rather than rising taxes third we will face a debt limit that debt limit will be a point in time when if it is not increased the federal government will not be able to borrow more money the most responsible thing we could do is force the federal government to a crisis if we have not already passed a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget and if we have not already passed a budget for 1983 that cuts spending only by using the debt limit as a leverage point can we force the changes which clearly the liberal democratic leadership of this body wants to avoid what is at stake i asked bob disharoon a realtor from georgia what impact an 11percent interest rate would have and he said well people could buy houses other people could build houses lumbermen could start cutting trees again furniture factories would start up automobile plants would start up we would begin to put people back to work they would pay taxes again we would begin to see prosperity return i said would it really make that big a difference to get down to 11percent interest rates and he said it is hard to exaggerate the impact on this country the optimism the hope the spirit that would emerge if we saw that we were getting spending under control that our deficits were going to come down and that we were coing to be able to have 11percent interest rates well that is what is at stake those americans who have been laid off or may be laid

magic potion that the presidents medicine men have concocted is poisoning the patient in his budget proposals to congress for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 the president has presented us with a voodoo energy policy where the marketplaces magic substitutes for balance and substantive analysis with only ideology as a guide the presiderts fiscal year 1983 budget proposes to slash energy conservation programs by 94 percent and renewable energy programs by 78 percent meanwhile nuclear programs continue virtually unscathed and constitute an incredible 87 percent of the proposed energy technologies budget the congress largely rejected the fiscal year 1982 energy budget proposal and did so again in the fiscal year 1983 budget resolution however even though congress restored a degree of balance and equity to federal energy programs last year support for energy conservation programs is way below what it would be under an administration that was truly concerned about this nations energy future if the administration gets its way there will be many victims of voodoo energy policy the poor and the elderly will be victims if the administration is allowed to eliminate the lowincome weatherization program and slash lowincome energy assistance which so many people depend on the administration already has tried to wipe out weatherization by starving it of the funds congress authorized and appropriated as a result many of the competent workers who were trained in weatherization had to look elsewhere for jobs in the fall moderate and lowincome people will be victims if reagan succeeds in terminating the solar energy and energy conservation bank the bank would help individuals pay the upfront costs of installing energy saving equipment the president has refused to spend the money congress provided the bank for fiscal year 1982 and it has taken a successful lawsuit in which i joined as a plaintiff to force the administration to spend that money our schools and hospitals will also be victims as will the people they serve and the taxpayers who support them the administration wants to elinminate the program to provide technical assistance and grants for energy conservation equipment for those institutions apparently the administration would like schools to lay off teachers and hospitals to raise medical costs as their response to the high energy prices of the marketplace consumers will be victims because the administration wants to cut funds for state energy offices and their efforts to provide energy information to the public as this is not bad enough the administration also proposes repealing numerous energy conservation laws by zeroing out the energy department programs which implement and enforce those laws for example the administration has decided not to prescribe federal efficient standards for households appliances even though the law requires it to issue standards unless energy savings are negligible and costs are too high the departments own analyses conclude that the nation could save as much as 2 million barrels of oil and that consumers could save more than 19 billion by the year 2005 through such standards the administration also proposed terminating the residential conservation service program which requires utility companies to provide customers with lowincome home energy audits provide advice on costeffective energy conservation measures and arrange financing for these measures finally the administration intends to ignore the law establishing the federal energy management program that program monitors the federal govern ments own energy performance and could save millions of taxpayer dollars in reduced government energy bills will the dramatia budget cuts in conservation and renewable energy programs help control the deficit absolutely not in fact the administrations doe budget for 1983 is virtually identical to that of 1981 the difference is that cuts aborbed by conservation and renewable energy programs are being reprocessed to fuel the departments nuclear energy program last year congress rejected the administrations energy proposals and established its own energy budget priorities the administration would like to forget that congress has already spoken on at least a half dozen times over the past year in support of a balanced energy budget i am confident that once again congress will reject the administrations proposals and enact its own energy budget repudiation of these misdirected priorities is the best antidote for the noxious curative of the presidents

retrogression combined with what we have already done it does redistribute wealth upward from the bottom to the top it amounts to a long leap into the past it is not a new beginning the policies of mr stockman mr reagan and mr volcker are not new policies these are the threadbare remnants of the twenties warmed over they are the trickledown policies invoked by coolidge and mellon and hoover scarcely distiguishable it is said that the president admires more than any of his predecessors former president calvin coolidge because of the tax cuts for the wealthy that were enacted during the coolidge administration and because of the 5 years of bubble prosperity over which mr coolidge presided before the bubble burst those were years of the rich getting richer at least on paper they were years in which worker productivity increased by 43 percent but wages increased by only 8 percent can anybody seriously doubt the reason for the ultimate collapse people simply were not able to buy those things that business was turning out for their consumption hence the glut of goods on the market frantic lastminute price fluctuations nobody able to get out of debt panic on wall street and a final capitulation of the economic structure that was the blind samson of dogma that strained against the pillars of the philistine temples of the twenties and those that it slew in its death were more than it slew in its life that is the dogma of david stockman you can call it supply side if you want to its real name is trickle down it is the belief of george gilder that regressive taxes help the poor and that only the rich have sense enough to invest in things that are good for america that is what is behind kemproth that is not the basic american doctrine it is not consistent with our economic history it is not even sound conservative doctrine respectable conservative economists have denounced it george bush called it voodoo economics it did not work for coolidge and hooever it is not working for margaret thatcher what makes us think it will work for us already with grammlatta ii we have repealed a lot of the carefully constructed work of the new deal the fair deal the new frontier and the great society much of that which we have put in place during the last 50 years to help people now at mr stockmans and mr reagans insistance we have cut social security we have cut job training we have cut meals on wheels we have cut medicare school lunches will cost more bus fares will be higher student loans will be harder to get and harder to repay day care centers and nursing homes will be harder to find home loans if not impossible to get are impossible to pay even the clean water program has been reduced to a trickle i say to my friends that this is not an economic recovery program it is an economic retrenchment program let us be sure that we understand its effect in connection with this proposed tax cut the kemproth cut is not across the board equally it is not an equal percentage cut in taxes paid and nobody can say it is it is a percentage cut in tax rates think what a profound difference that makes coupled with indexing the clear effect is to reduce taxes paid by the wealthy not by 25 percent but probably by more like 40 percent and then to immunize them forever from increases so any future increase in defense needs or education will have to come from payroll taxes or sales taxesin other words from the pockets of the middleincome and the working poor that is what we are sealing into place if we pass this substitute the republican plan could easily wind up with a deficit by 1984 of 70 billion but of course the president has recommended that we cut social security payments over the next 5 years by 70 billion is that how we are to make things come

progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs

concurrent resolution 115 because when compared to the budget committees budget resolution and the other substitutes we believe it takes a fairer and more equitable approach to balancing the budget when president reagan first outlined his economic recovery plan before a joint session of congress back in january of this year he also issued a challenge to those of us in congress who disagreed with his approach he challenged those of us who chose not to march lockstep with him to come up with a better plan to put the economy back on track and to cut inflati n the congressional black caucus was the first among the nonbelievers to accept the reagan challenge we fashioned an alternative approach to put the fiscal year 1982 budget in balance this approach is embodied in the fauntroy substitute the fauntroy substitute is the best approach to achieving a balanced budget because it does not impair the integrity of essential social programs the fauntroy substitute is more equitable than the administrations budget resolution than the gramm latta substitute and than other proposals which we will soon be voting on the fauntroy substitute is the best approach because it seeks fair tax relief for allamericansunlike many of the budget resolutions presently before the house this is why the fauntroy substitute stands out as a beacon of light and hope while other budget resolutions evoke so much despair and resignation among the increasingly restive masses now i turn to my two assigned subjects transportation and economic development let us briefly examine the overall community and regional transportation development components of the various budget resolutions and compare them to the fauntroy substitute using the disingenious and questionable arguments of effectiveness and of returning authority to the states the reagan budget plan would terminate the urban development action grants program as a separate entity and wouldr instead consolidate udag with an expanded community developmnentblock grant program budget authority and outlays for cdbg for fiscal year 1982 would be 4 166 million and 5 447 million respedtively the house budget committee budget resolution and grammlatta substitute call for the same level of budget authority and outlays as the administrations proposal for these programs the fauntroy substitute in con trast seeks increased budget authority and outlays for fiscal yc af 1982 for these valuiable programs which are so essential in the struggle to upgradedisadvantaged atnd or dcteriorating urban areas for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy substitute seeks 4 666 million in budget authority and 5 847 million in outlays more importantly the fauntroy substitute would continue to fund the udag program as a separate entity at its present funding level of 675 million this is because we recognize the tremendous potential for creating and maintaining jobs in disadvantaged areas through the udag program through udag communities must qualify as bl ng distressed or must have within them pockets of poverty to receive grant funds though the administration claims that tax incentives will be as effective in creating jobs its udag the congressional black caucus recognizes the accomplishments of this program nationwide and the necessity for a program to target the creation of new jobs to areas where they are most desperately needed while the obey substitute is somewhat better than the administrations proposal in regard to udag and to cdbg it nevertheless falls short of matching the fauntroy substitute in regards to budget authority and outlays for these vital programsespecially udag in the area of econ6mic developmentthe reagan administrations proposal would terminate the economic development administration by zerobudgeting this agency for fiscal year 1982 it is clear that the administration is not content with its hatcheting of this agencythat has been so importi nt in the creation of jobs and business expansionit wants to further emasculate the eda by rescinding 342 million in funds that have al ready been appropriated to this agency for the current fiscal year thereby jeopardizing projects that are currently in the works incliiding the promised sale for reopening of the closed wisconsin steel mill which eda owns i submit that this coldhearted approach to eda is counterproductive to one of the central themes this administration professes to be aboutthat being to spur economic development the office of management and budget seeks a mere 32 million in budget authority for fiscal year 1982 and 344 million in outlays to fund economic development programs and activities this counterproductive shortsightedness will encourage a further concentration of industrial ownership andless businesscompetitionand consequently prices will soar higher and employment will fall deeper although the budget committees resolution is an improvement over the administrations proposal in this area itfalls farshort of theipauntroy sub stitutes figures for econic development programs house concurrent resolution 115 would restore approximately 60 percent of the funds for fiscal year 1982 but would rescind 162 million of the agencys funds for the present fiscal year fop fiscal year 1982 the budget authority recommended by the budget committee for economic development would be only 360 million in budget authority and 519 million in outlays the obey substitute is similar to the committees budget but i would like to note it does add an additional 100 million in budget authority and 5 million in outlays the fauntroy substitute however would restore 800 million for eda with budget authority of 932 million and outlays of 1 044 million for economic development programs these increases in authority and outlays will assure that worthwhile economic development programa will continue to receive adequate funds to carry out their purposes no other budget resolution being offered today does this finally mr chairman i would like to compare the transportation function in the admindstrations proposed budget and the other substitutes that have been offered under president reagans proposal the northeast corridor improvement program necip would be cut by 288 million amtrak would be cut by 380 million and federal aid to conrail would be totally eliminated budget authority for fiscal year 1982 would be set at 863 million and outlays would be set at 999 million the budget committees resolution would restore 200 million for amtrak and 300 for conrail it calls far 1 499 million in outlays the hefner approach in this area is the same as that of the budget committee and the grammlatta substitute is also essentially similar to the administrations proposal in the area of rail transportation the obey substitute seeks the same level of budget authority as the fauntroy substitute 1 463 millionit calls for 300 ilion less in outlays for rail transportation than does the

the dropping of conrails commuter linesforcing local authorities to pick up and operate these services the corkgressional black caucus firmly believes thatrail transportation is a vital adjunct to our nations transportation system which must not be allowed to perish while it is striving so valiantly to not only stay alive to meet our countrys transportation needs but to become profitable as well in terms of mass transit operating assistance the reagan administration proposal would phase out federal moneys between 1983 and 1985 in terms of budget authority the administration seeks 1 105 millionand in outlays it seeks 922 million the grammlatta substitute seeks to accelerate the phase out of mass transit operating assistance even faster by cutting 260 million in fiscal authority in 1982 instead of in 1983 the fauntroy substitute would continue the mass transit operating assistance program at levels which had been recommended by the previous administration 1 105 million for fiscal years 1982 1983 and 1984 in budget authority in this particular program area the budget committees resolution mirrors the caucus however it should be clear to all of us that the elimination of operating assistance will have an enormously negative impact on the nations mass transit systems the loss of funds is likely tor result in substantial fare increases which are counterproductive in that they drive away riders and the end result is that revenues fall such cutbacks are likely to also ca use cutbacks in services and the physical deterioration of the transit systems themselves plus the shutdown of complete systems in small cities moreover such a result will seriously injure downtown and innercity commercial areas unless we are watchful the wealthy soon will be able to take a shuttle to the moon while the nonwealthy will not be able to catcha bus downtown by way of summation r believe that the reagan administration budget proposal and the other substitutes that have been of fered lack vision they demonstrate insufficient appreciation for the needs of those americans who are most dependent on the programs and services which will be eliminated or pareddown to vitual uselessness hi regard to their stated purposes i believe thatthe fauntroy substitute is the only proposal which will balance the budget but which will do so equitably and not at the expense of any essential program or constituency it is the one which deals most fairly with all race and creeds in our great nation o 1645"], [0.037864744663238525, 0.9621352553367615, 1, "the purpose of the olympic games is to promote athletic competition among the greatest amateur athletes in the wvorld the games are designed to benefit the athletes unfortunately the 1984 summer olympic games in los angeles may well be the games where the concerns of private outside interests are more important than the athletes unless congress acts to protect the interests of the athletes the unitedstates government and the american people a new event world scandal may be added to the 1984 summer olympic games at the present time there are two coinage proposals before the congress designed to raise money to help finance the massive costs of the 1984 games and to help train american athletes for those games these proposals are signficantly different and it is important that the differences be known i am a strong supporter of the olympic program and our olympic athletes i was the author of legislation last year to provide gold medals to our entire olympic team and i was proud to stand on the steps of the capitol when the members of our team were awarded these medals by the president of the united states while these gold medals in no way made up for the disappointment of our athletes not participating in moscow they nevertheless were designed to recogn17e these men and women for their athletic excellence because of my feeling toward our olympic athletes i introduced legislation on june 11 of this year designed to raise money to train athletes the legislation h r 3879 provides for the minting of 90 percent silver dollar coins that would be sold directly to the public by the unitedstates mint half the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce the national debt and the other half would go to the united states olympic committee to train our olympic athletes the legislation calls for the minting of 25 million silver dollars the coins would be sold at a price in the 20 to 25 range at that price my legislation wbuld raise between 100 to 275 million if all the coins were sold given the success of the recent carson city silver dollar sale i fully anticipate a sellout of the olympic coins my legislation provides for a general accounting office audit of both the sale of the coins and the use of the proceeds by the united states olympie committee to make certain that the money goes directly to the benefit of athletic training the week after introduction of my bill a second bill which i call the lazardoccidental bill was introduced this legislation calls for the striking of 29 different coins by the unitedstates mint with all of the coins being sold directly to a marketing group composed of the investment banking firm of lazard freres and occidental petroleum who have been given a license by the los angeles olympic committee to sell olympic coins the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of these coins would go to the private marketers in fact the private interests can earn as much as 94 million profit on this deal a portion of the funds raised by the 29 coin bill would be given to the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and an even smaller amount would be funneled to the united states olympic committee the legislation does not allow for the general accounting office to audit any portion of the transaction and in fact it virtually turns control of the unitedstates mint over to lazard freres and occidental i am deeply concerned that the lazardoccidental bill will lead to scandal not only will our athletes be tainted and the american people disillusioned but the bill actually may provide little or no money for training our athletes in february 4 months prior to the introduction of any legislation the laooc quietly awarded exclusive worldwide marketing rights for olympic coins to a concern composed of lazard freres and occidental lazardocaidental gave the laqoc 5 million of which 1 million is nonrefundable the laqoc is also entitled to keep all th interest earned on the other 4 million in march the laooc gave the unitedstates olympic committee a check for 500 000 as their share of the nonrefundable 1 million in effect the laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee sold their rights in any coins to lazard freres and occidental petroleum this is morally and ethiically wrong and casts doubt on the ability of the lagoc and the olympic committee to speak objectively on this issue secrecy seems to surround the details of the relationship between the laooc and lazardoccidental for the past 3 months i have tried without success to obtain a copy of the contract between the laooc and lazard freresoccidental i have received a copy of theletter of understanding between the parties but despite assurances from those representing the coin marketers that i would get a copy of the contract it has never been presented i can well understand why they would not make the contract available to me because the letter of understanding is so shocking that the complete contract is probably too hot to be made public lazardoccidental are no strangers to the world of marketing olympic and sportsrelated coins last year they had the exclusive rights to marketing soviet olympic coins in the free world it is ironic that they were pushing these coins in the american market at the very same time our athletes had made a decision not to participate in the moscow games while i stood on the capitol steps as our olympic athletes received medals for boycotting the moscow games lazardoccidental were busy raising american money to stage those games as with the agreement with laooc information about the financial aspects of the sale of soviet coins is hard to come by as far as i know no information has been released although various members of the media have requested it from both the russians and the lazardoccidental marketing concern recently i learned that a company called numarco distributing co has been accused of improprieties in greece in obtaining the exclusive mar my bill requires that the

action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than
