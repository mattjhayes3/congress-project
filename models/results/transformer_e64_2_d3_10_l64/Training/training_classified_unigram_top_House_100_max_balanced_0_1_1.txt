commitment her friendship i will miss our conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance will now grant her peace sala we loved you we will remember you and we will retell you story for years to come"], [0.003965556621551514, 0.9960344433784485, 1, "i

sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings of jewish identity and the commitments to the goals and ideals of her

first tribute to sala burton i came to the floor and i listened to what the others were saying about sala and i know each of us was so taken with our own thoughts one of the things i did i kept looking up to that area of the gallery and remembering so many times that i would look up there if there was one of phils battles on the floor a major piece of legislation that phil would be handling if it was an important moment for this house sala burton before she became a member but as phils partner would be sitting right up there i kept looking up there missing her i have to say that sala was my very dear personal friend when i heard so many members coming from all over that day on such short notice to eulogize sala and to say how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift that for each one of us she was our special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get legislation through this house that gave the virgin islands a seat in this house of representatives the relationship between phil and sala was such a beautiful relationship phil the stormy phil burton the great legislator the powerful individual with a heart even bigger than that huge body he had and sala that loved him that was his true partner and how he loved her too at the funeral service in san francisco there were those that recalled how sala would calm the troubled waters that phil had passed by and she had that gift we will all miss sala she was a woman of great conviction as another member just said today she was so proud of her jewishness she cared so much for the poor and for those that needed help and that was why i particularly liked both phil and sala they were legislators that cared and never forgot why they had come here when sala came into this body as an elected representative many thought perhaps that this was just sala burton the devoted wife and partner of phil coming here but she sure showed us she was a very very effective

know it her political beliefs crew directly out of her compassionate and caring personality it was wonderfully typical of salawhose political causes spanned continentsthat she found time to lend a hand to the small territory of the virgin islands she and her late husband phil were abiding political allies and personal friends for more than 20 years over the yearseven as they worked tirelessly for peace and civil rights and national parklands for allthey extended their concerns to the virgin islands and other offshore territories thanks to leaders like sala and phil we in the islands have

failed policy in central america we can either seize or we can reject an historic opportunity to promote peace in central america on the table is whether to send an additional 36 million to the nicaraguan contras a no vote will give the central american peace process a chance to succeed a yes vote will promote more bloodshed and instability in a region already ravaged by conflict for 6 years we have fueled war in nicaragua under the guise of promoting peace we have tried to win the hearts and minds of the nicaraguan peopleyet our united statesbacked contras have burned health clinics attacked farm cooperatives and destroyed schools the administration calls for democracy in nicaraguabut trampled it at home with the irancontra affair so far has been legally spent 275 million on the contras what are the fruits of this policy a trail of senseless killing compare this legacy with the recent accomplishments of the guatemala accord the state of emergency in nicaragua has been lifted amnesty to some 3 000 political prisoners has been granted municipal and local elections are promised and special courts have been abolished the sandinistas have entered direct talks with the contras reopened la prensa reopened radio catolica and issued 13 licenses for new radio stations el salvador and guatemala have also taken important steps because of these tangible real actions and the future promise of the guatemala accord we have reached an impasse over aid to the contras the united states cannot talk peace and fund war we cannot support both the guatemala accord and the nicaraguan contras the proposal we are considering today is not a modest request to keep food in the mouths of contras it is a package to keep the contras waging war in the countryside if we are really on the side of peace in central america we must reject this request let me make three simple points about the presidents request first according to the administration 90 percent of this aid would be for nonlethal purposes but this nonlethal funding can be used for helicopters military training aircraft spare parts portable bridges and intelligence operations not one penny of this package would have to go for food medicine and clothing second this aid would represent not only a continuation but an escalation of the war in nicaragua this package is worth 300 000 a dayroughly three times the rate we recently passedunfortunatelyunder the continuing resolution this is not the time to escalate the war this is the time to end it third under the presidents proposal 3 6 million in lethal aid would be held in escrow and released on march 31 if no ceasefire is in place this would mean that if the contras could stall ceasefire talks until march 31 they would be awarded with 3 6 million in guns and ammunition what possible incentive would they have to negotiate for 6 years the american people and the congress were told that contra aid would bring the sandinistas to the bargaining table thanks to the courage of president arias and the other central american presidents nicaragua is at the bargaining tableand yet were here considering a new aid request from the president it is now clear what the presidents policy recently is his policy is to aid the contras because the sandinistas are communistsnothing more nothing less that is a bankrupt hollow and simplistic policy a policy driven by ideology rather than pragmatism led by former somocistas the contras have not and will not win the support of the nicaraguan people they cannot win a significant military victory they have been corrupt and guilty of numerous human rights abuses as yet they have no program for nicaragua and no future vision for nicaragua except to remove the sandinistas finally let me say that for 6 years the administration has been telling us that its contra policy will promote democracy and freedom in central america but after 6 years all we have to show for it are thousands of dead civilians a region torn apart by bloodshed and strife and a deepening distrust of americans in central america true to the meaning of the word contra the administrations policy is contra the rule of law at home and abroadcontra the central american peace processcontra the request of nobel peace prize recipient president ariascontra the will of the american peopleand contra the real needs of a region suffering in unspeakable poverty this policy is contra our fundamental american respect for human rights today we can close this unfortunate chapter of american policy we can help end the war in nicaragua and

contras or no assistance at ail this house defeated the administrations request for military aid to the contres that day today the choice before us is more difficult we must decide whether to support a modified humanitarian aid package to aid the victims of war or set a strategy that will result in approving the administrations military aid package the choice today is military aid or humanitarian aid by the nature of that choice it forces approval of an aid package that hopefully begins to heal the terrible wounds of war and moves our government a small step forward toward facilitating peace in central america the key to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in central america has and will be adherence to the guatemala peace process led by costa rican president oscar arias the basis of our policy in that region must be to work with and respect the other nations of central america to obtain a diplomatic solution through the peace effort underway they requested that we stop military aid we showed respect for the peace process and people of central america when we defeated a request for military assistance 1 month ago and the house must continue in that path for peace by defeating any and all military aid requests so that the peace process can continue toward a permanent ceasefire and a return to regional stability the time has come to undo the destruction of life fostered over the past 7 years to the tune of 1 billion now is the time for the american people to regain control of our options in nicaragua now is the time to pressure the administration to hold bilateral and multilateral talks with nicaragua and now is the time to turn our resources in the region from supplying weapons of war to building instruments of peace the bitter choice is that in order to prevent the passage of military assistance to the contras we must provide some modified humanitarian aid to victims of the war in nicaragua and the contras we nrc have a congressional majority and majority of americans working fervently toward peace we have a strong coalition in the house committed to rejecting lethal and nonlethal military aid we must retain that coalition the democratic aid package is not perfect qnd it does not take the preferred step which would be an end to all forms of aid to the contras however this package does make some important strides toward encouraging compliance with the central american peace plan as well as a necessary step toward an orderly and humane withdrawal of united states military aid to the contras for the first time since 1979 a truly humanitarian aid package will be sent to the people of nicaragua president arias is on record stating that this package is not inconsistent with the spirit and letter to the peace accord this package sets an essential precedent by designating half of the 30 million for the children victims of war over 10 000 orphans and thousands of youthful casualties have been caused from land mines attacks on civilian villages and targeting of health clinics in nicaragua this 14 6 million childrens survival assistance will be distributed by the agency for international development to private voluntary organizations like the red cross and the united nations children fund already in operation within nicaragua and along the honduran and costa rican borders to noncombatant children under the age of 15 the aid will be distributed by giving highest priority to those children on both sides of the war with the greatest need for assistance by making available prosthetic devices and rehabilitation provide medicine and immunization for more than 100 000 children assist burn victims and provide relief to all nicaraguan children physically injured or displaced by the nicaraguan conflict no funds will go to or through the government of nicaragua this humanitarian aid package will also include 1 4 million in assistance to the miskito indians through the international red cross so long as there is a cessation of hostilities and progress toward a negotiated ceasefire continues the miskito indians and the government of nicaragua reached a ceasefire agreement earlier this year the democratic package also includes an immediate end to all lethal aid to the contras including weapons and ammunition the leadership of congress and the gao will monitor the shipment of food blankets and medical supplies to the contras which will be accomplished by dod private contractors to assure no lethal aid is quietly included deliveries will be inspected onsite by officials of the gao while oversight of the operation lies with the intelligence committees of congress if a ceasefire is in place before the end of june 1988 then unitedstates humanitarian assistance automatically continues through international agencies in accordance with a ceasefire agree ment ii no ceasefire is in place by the end of june unitedstates assistance comes to a halt the one clear fact is that this war despite the efforts of the administration is winding down the humanitarian aid package is not designed to encourage continued warfare but to assist those who have fought in the transition to peace the contras are not nor will they ever be the solution to the conflict in central america that policy has failed for 7 years and never again will the america people tolerate millions of taxpayer dollars to go unaccounted for and countless spending violations to occur in carrying out this administrations thoughtless policy toward central america the humanitarian aid package that i will support today prevents misuse of the public trust and money it also prevents the escalation of the war in nicaragua this alternative ensures a commitment by our government to economic development social justice and true humanitarian aid to the children of nicaragua the primary effort for peace in central america must continue to rest with people of that region not the united states a negotiated ceasefire can only be accomplished by factions currently involved in the conflict continuing to meet and work out their differences american negotiators did not bring about the peace accord the five central american presidents accomplished the agreement not imposed on them from the outside and it is up to those leaders to bring about a lasting ceasefire and cessation of the conflict although our vote today will not finally end the war it can help end the administrations united states military option in nicaragua it will strengthen the congressional coalition aimed at supporting peace and ending military aid it will strengthen president arias and the peace plan by keeping diplomatic solutions alive let todays vote reflect another chapter in the effort to explore every avenue for peace

the house to provide that the house will not consider any measure providing further aid to the contras until the reports of both of the select committees investigating the irancontra affair have been filed with the house and senate on january 7 1987 by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 2 the house adopted house resolution 12 creating the select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran the previous day by another overwelmingly bipartisan vote of 88 to 4 the senate adopted senate resolution 23 creating the select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition these committees were charged with important responsibilities although their chief function is to investigate those responsible for illegally selling arms to iran and providing unauthorized covert aid to the contras the committees were also specifically requested to review the international policy objectives of the united states and to make recommendations on legislative actions necessary or proper to reduce the harm to unitedstates policy that has been caused by the irancontra affair the resolution which i am introducing today simply postpones any consideration in the house of further aid to the contras until we have the benefit of the views of those committees as to the impact of the irancontra affair on unitedstates policy objectives and on what should be done to mitigate the harm done by that affair the resolution does not prohibit further aid to the contras or indeed prejudge the findings of those committees in any way it simply asks that we wait for the final verdict before entrusting further dollars and the public trust to those same officials and policies holding off a vote on contra aid until the reports of the select committees are filed would not impose a great delay the president is not expected to file his request for further aid to the contras before august or september the house select committee is scheduled to file its report by october 30 1987 the senate select committee which is currently scheduled to file its report by august 1 1987 will probably extend its deadline to the house date if the resolution which i am introducing today is adopted the house vote would be delayed only briefly i know that there will be some who will say there is no connection between the irancontra scandal and future policy but that is not true from what we know so far it is clear that some senior administration officials who are still centrally involved in promulgating and justifying our policy toward central america apparently lied to congress or tolerated lies by other officials in order to safeguard their policy objectives we must know whether they lied to congress before we can judge the validity of their calls for further aid to the contras we must know whether these are indeed individuals who would say anything to congress without regard for the truth to get more aid to the contras we must have that information before we vote on another aid request the other basis for this proposal is that we need to regain some control of the process under which we consider contraaid proposals assuming the expedited procedures for consideration of contra aid are retained we will have to make a decision on contra aid under a timetable determined by the administration and one which presumably will be favorable to the administation the formal request for aid may be timed to require a vote before the irancontra reports are filed or to coincide with a summit meeting or some other major event we cannot control completely the impact of outside events on our votes but we can and should control the impact of events inside congress on our votes the single most significant event inside congress with a direct bearing on a vote on aid to the contras is the completion of the work of the select committees i think it is clear too that the american people see a connection between the completion of the hearings and a vote on contra aid the american people are entitled to a full accounting of the policies and actions surrounding contra aid before not after a vote on any request for more taxpayer dollars to support the same policies there is little reason to hold such extensive hearings if congress and the nation cannot consider the lessons learned from this scandal in developing future policy the purpose of the irancontra hearings has been not only to expose wrongdoing but to come to a better understanding of those who engaged in these unlawful activities and of the processes which allowed these activities to occur we should have the opportunity to reflect on that information before we decide how we will vote on further aid to the contras the following is the text of the resolution h

below the budget on the grounds that the budget does not do enough to control spending this does not attempt that kind of reduction this amendment merely says that which we have already agreed upon

amendment was passed adjusting the level of the housing bill to the amount allowed in the budget it has become the rule in this house that authorizations should not exceed the amount of the budget to

108 billion set in december of 1985 with grammrudman because of the shortfall in the economy its failure to perform the way president reagan and his economic advisers have consistently saidthey have for years now a couple years consistently overpredicted the economy and it has preformed less well we have about 39 billion less to work with than we thought which makes the 108 billion very hard to reach the president pretends that he has reached it or he probably thinks he has he does that by making damaging cuts on elderly sick people on our policies in the area of the homeless on education on students damaging cuts there even with that and with asking for 10 billion more in fees from the elderly on medicare and people trying to buy homes and with asset sales which are poorly planned with phoney figures of 11 billion even with that he comes up with a budget which cbo says you are still 27 billion off the democratic response is to say ok let us start with a freeze on the budget in outlays and go up and down from there and see how close we can come and maybe we can close some tax loopholes maybe there is a way to do taxes equitably let us take a look at it the president after all has asked for 10 billion in taxes and fees so maybe we can go to 15 billion or 16 billion so let us take a look at the subject our republican colleagues say no to all of it no to the presidents budget which they wont because it is debtadvocating no they will not offer the presidents budget at the budget committee you would have thought if you just came in here naively on a tour that republican members of the house of representatives sitting in the budget committee might offer in whole or piece by piece a budget submitted by the republican president they know better they know what a shambles that budget is how much damage it would do to innocent people how intellectually flawed its assumptions are so they ignore that and instead like sds reborn they send a list of demands to the budget committee chairman saying we will not participate in the process until you guarantee us that the senate is going to pass all the appropriation bills that is one of the things they are asking for of course the senate did not do that when it was in republican hands it passed about half of them it says you have to insist that there will be no tax increases at all probably no loopholes could be closed i do not know what that means about the tax increases that the president wants whether they like the president think that because he has asked for them they are not tax increases but that is where we are yes we will on our side come up with a budget it will cause some pain to people because we have all of us overspent the president has asked for a little bit more money than congress has appropriated but we have appropriated virtually the same amount so the blame for spending is a shared blame in my view much too much went to the military i do not know how many hundreds of millions have gone down a rathole in nicaragua and central america that could have been used had we had them to reduce the homelessness completelywell not completely but substantially not completely in any case that is where we stand today a budget by the president that no one respects and no one believes in that is a laugh i yield to the gentleman from michigan"]]}
