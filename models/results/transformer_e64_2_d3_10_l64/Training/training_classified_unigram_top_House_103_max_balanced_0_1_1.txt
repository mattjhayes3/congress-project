about whitewater and they have heard about some of the mysterious things that have happened in the investigation into vince fosters death but there is a lot of other interesting things that have happened involving the rose law firm in little rock ar and hillary rodham clinton and the former governor of arkansas bill clinton tonight i would like to talk about two cases involving the failure of two savings and loans and the involvement of the rose law firm and some possible conflicts of interest that should be investigated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation as well as the special counsel mr starr first american savings and loan of oak brook il was seized by the federal authorities for the federal government in 1986 first american savings and loan of oak brook was headed by former illinois gov dan walker dan lasater a friend of bill clinton had a brokerage business united capital corp and it traded treasury bond futures for first federal savings and loan of illinois and others dan lasater ran a brokerage firm in little rock ar he was a big contributor to bill clintons gubernatorial campaigns he was a friend of bill clinton and he flew clinton around in his private jet lasater gave roger clinton bill clintons brother a job and loaned him 8 000 to pay off a drug debt lasaters brokerage firm received a lucrative contract from the government of arkansas worth 750 000 to sell state bonds for a new arkansas state police communications network he also received millions of dollars in bonds for the arkansas development financial authority in 1986 lasater was convicted on drug charges this is bill clintons good friend he served only part of his sentence and he was pardoned after serving a small part of his sentence by then gov bill clinton in 1985 dan walker the former governor of illinois discovered that first american savings and loan was losing money big time on its treasury bond future trades with dan lasater according to court records mr walker lost approximately 361 000 walker claims that lasater made unauthorized trades with first federals money and walker told the chicago tribune they lasater co had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer at the time they made the trade and they did not do that walker sued lasater for 3 3 million for mail wire and securities fraud the suit charged that one of lasaters employees used first federals money to carry out what were in effect personal treasury bill trades does this sound familiar members heard me on the floor not long ago talking about a gentleman named dennis patrick from kentucky he had a similar story according to mr patrick in published accounts between 60 million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without mr patricks knowledge they traded 60 million to 107 million in bond trades in his account and he did not even know about it on 1 day 23 million was traded on his account without his knowledge now when federal regulators the fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corporation seized first american of illinois they continued to pursue the lawsuit against lasater they wanted to recover as much money as they possibly could dan walker the former governor of illinois was accused of lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured depositors money and later ended up being convicted of bank fraud and perjury hopkins sutter i know this is very complicated but hopkins sutter a chicago law firm was the primary contractor or law firm for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation hopkins sutter hired or subcontracted with a law firm in little rock ar called the rose law firm to handle the suit against lasater i hope everybody will think about this my colleagues lasater co mr lasater was a very close friend of bill clinton he flew around in his private jet they went on parties together lasater was convicted along with bill clintons brother of drug dealing lasater paid one of bill clintons brothers drug loans of 8 000 and after lasater was convicted he was pardoned by then gov bill cliiton rose law firm is hired as a subcontractor for the purpose of the suit against lasater they are going to go after lasater and hillary rodham clinton and vince foster were the two lawyers from the law firm the rose law firm to go after mr lasater think about that for a minute they are going after lasater for the federal government at the same time that he is a very good friend of gov bill clinton and has been pardoned for drug trafficking by the governor dan lasater was convicted of drug charges in 1986 as i said and served only a small part of his sentence and was later pardoned by the governor now president clinton now enter hillary rodham clinton rose law firms powerhouse lawyer and vince foster they handled the governments suit against lasater it is hard to believe this conflict of interest could occur but they are handling the case against lasater bill clintons friend because of the close ties between lasater and bill and hillary clinton she never should have been involved in this matter in any way that is a big conflict of interest in late 1987 a confidential settlement was reached between the government and lasater he ended up paying 200 000 of the 3 3 million suit that is all just 200 000 the chicago tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filings court records show that hillary rodham clinton and vince foster negotiated this settlement from 3 3 million down to 200 000 it started on may 8 1987 when hillary rodham clinton signed an amended complaint on this case that reduced the damages sought by the fslic against lasater from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million she negotiated the reduction of this down from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million for the fdic at a time when the guy lasater she was supposed to be nailing to the wall was a good friend of she and bill clinton the governor of arkansas the fdic said hillarys involvement tvas not extensive enough to constitute a conflict of interest this sounds like a whitewash by the fdic and to cover their tails the fdic said under federal rules existing at the time she did not have to inform the federal government about her close relationship with lasater and lasaters company the fdic said hillary worked only 3 houi s on the case they said she was not involved in the final decision to settle at 200 000 the fdic says vince foster did most of the work on this case he was her partner at rose the fslic that hired hillary and vince foster and the rose law firm could not remember details of the case the fdics earlier inquiry was primarily a review of court records and records submitted by the rose law firm the fdic did not interview i lary rodham clinton because of the apparent fdic wh wash in late february sena alfonse damato of new york questd the fdic acting chairm andrew hove to have the fdic insy tor general conduct a thorough rev of this matter and madison guarar hove asked the inspector general complete its investigation and relp to him in 90 days that was back february here we are in septem and the report has not yet come do now why why has the igs report come down it was demanded or quested by senator damato of senate banking committee and it supposed to be done in 90 days here we are almost a year later c months later and we have not hear thing i wonder if the white house anything to do with stopping that port obviously 90 days are over we still have no report on this case thomas scorza a former assist unitedstates attorney who teaches legal etl at the university of chicago i school said the following to the c cago tribune newspaper a lawyer is required to represent the in ests of their client zealously there is a i istantial question about whether an attor was representing a client zealously if the ponent of the client is someone with w the attorney has a political financial personal relationship and make no mistake about it i lary rodham clinton and bill clin had a very close relationship lasater and this was not made kn when hillary rodham clinton took that case in looking at the settlem he went on were they the rose law firm and hil rodham clinton looking after lasaters terests or the interests of the federal posit insurance corporation actually the federal savings loan insurance corporation scc told the chicago tribune that hill rodham clinton should not h worked on the case especially si the final settlement was confidentia william wernz a former chairmai the minnesota lawyers responsibi board for the minneapolis tribune s that the bar association model r define as conflict of interest instan where it is likely a lawyer might pull a punch because he or she some relationship with the other side some third party of interest law and accounting firms are usu barred from representing the federal c eminent in s l cases if they have per ally represented the s l or if they have sonal links to the persons targeted by lawsuit and that was specifically the case 4 lasater and company dan lasater a friend of bill clintons he conti uted generously to bill clintons c4 paign for governor he flew clin around in his private jet they had i ties together they went out toget all of the time dan lasater gave roger clinton a and loaned him a large sum of moi 1l to pay drug debts and after lasater was convicted on drug charges and ite served a small part of his sentence tor then gov bill clinton pardoned him re yet his wife hillary rodham clinan ton who knew lasater very well took ec the side of the government in the case iew against lasater reduced the settleity ment from 3 3 million down to 200 000 to and the fslic was literally screwed ort out of all of that money from 3 3 milin lion down to 200 000 there was defiber nitely a conflict of interest that she wn did not let the american people know not or the fslic know about re here is a related problem home fedthe eral savings and loan of centralia il was was also seized by federal regulators and home federals former president king ir 8 betz sued lasater and company for d a 4 6 million for unauthorized trading has he chose the rose law firm to handle re his suit and hillary rodham clinton and was a big partner in that law firm and he chose the rose law firm to handle ant his suit because the issues involved iics were similar to the issues in first aw american hi after the federal government took over home federal the federal govter ernment continued the case and they 3ub had the rose law firm carrying the ney case for them op thomas mars represented lasater on om the other side of the table against the and home federal federal government suit so you had on one side of the table hil the rose law firm of which hillary ton rodham clinton was a partner like the ith case i just cited and on the other side wn was this guy named thomas mars on now where did he come from he had ent previously worked at the rose law firm so you have on one side of the lary table negotiating for the federal govin ernment the rose law firm and you de have a former lawyer in that same law firm representing lasater does that and sound like some conniving some pecur liar circumstances mars had preary viously worked at the rose law firm ave where he had worked on the american nce suit he worked on the first american 1 suit that i just talked about therei of fore he may have had some inside inlity formation on the governments case said since the case he worked on at the iles rose law firm was very similar ces king betz the man who started the case ip the first place for home federal has savings and loan was advised by or vince foster of the rose law firm to ally accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlekov ment in september of 1989 and he 3on agreed to the settlement but he did per not know that both sides of the table the were being worked by the rose law firm and a former lawyer who worked ith for the rose law firm wras king betz says that vince foster was rib handling his suit and never told him am about mars potential conflict of interton est or the clintons ties to lasater ar according to the chicago tribune her when betz was told that mars previously worked with foster and hillary job rodham in the first federal case for hey the rose law firm betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information but the cat was already out of the bag or in the bag because he had already signed off on the 250 000 settlement on a suit that was supposed to be for 4 6 million there are some questions that need to be answered by the rose law firm and by the fslic and the fdic concerning these two cases first when will the fdic inspector general issue its report on hillary rodham clinton first american and madison guaranty is this report being delayed until after the election it was ordered in february was supposed to be done in 90 days and here we are in september 7 weeks before the election and we still do not have the report why that needs to be done quickly r0 1800 now here are some questions that need to be answered by the fdic and the new independent counsel mr starr if he is investigating this and i think he probably will and in full and complete congressional investigations and hearings did hillary rodham clinton and or the rose law firm inform the federal government of her and her husbands ties to dan lasater i do not believe she did but we need to know if she did this is regarding the first american if they did not inform the government of their ties to dan lasater then why did they not because it was obviously conflict of interest to what extent was hillary rodham clinton involved in the suits they said it was only 2 or 3 hours but she signed or got the agreement to reduce the suit from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million so she was very conversant with it and very actively involved in it specifically what role did hillary rodham clinton have in the final decision tosettle the suit for 200 000 down from the 3 3 million if she was involved how were her actions affected by her ties to dan lasater and lasater co who was responsible for handling the case hillary rodham clinton vince foster or both obviously they were both partners in the rose law firm there had to be a conflict there who decided who would handle this case if vince foster was handling the case why was hillary rodham clinton involved at all we do know for sure the fdic has said that hillary rodham clinton signed the amended complaint reducing the damages sought from 3 3 million to 1 3 million now involving the home federal case why was not king betz the chairman there told about thomas mars conflict of interest he was a former lawyer with the rose law firm defending lasater why was not betz told about the ties between the clintons and lasater was the fdic informed about any of this did thomas mars the former errfployee of the rose law firm use inside information to arseptember20 1994 co range a 250 000 settlement on an over 4 million original suit these are questions that need to be answered the more we get into the machinations of the clintons the more we find all kinds of chicanery from whitewater to madison savings loan to these two savings and loan institutions in illinois to the angel fire development in new mexico there are so many questions that need to be answered that is why we need full and complete congressional hearings not just the facade we saw with the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in the house just a few months ago the people of this country have a right to know if there is corruption in this government they have a right to know if hillary rodham clinton had a conflict of interest when she was representing these individuals for the fdic i mean her husband was the governor he was a friend of the man that she was supposed to be nailing to the wall and she reduced the claim from 3 3 million down to 200 000 there are all kinds of questions that need to be answered and the only way the people of this country are going to know the facts is for us to have complete and thorough congressional hearings and they need to be held as quickly as possible i commend to my colleagues the following february 3 1994 chicago tribune article the special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize the business dealings of the president and first lady will focus on their role in an ozark land development called whitewater but there is another case buried deep in court records that could prove equally troubling to bill and hillary rodham clinton particularly if robert fiske the republican special prosecutor and former unitedstates attorney in new york makes good on his pledge to publish a report on the clintons political and business relationships when the president was governor of arkansas in the 1980s it involves a court case the first lady helped settie when she was a highpowered lawyer in little rock and the government was trying to sort out the problems of a bankrupt illinois savings and loan the illinois s l case suggests that hillary clinton as a private attorney had a glaring conflict of interest as an attorney for the federal deposit insurance corp she helped negotiate a secret outofcourt settlement that ended the governments suit against a family friend and an influential benefactor of her husband but the political problems the case could pose for the president and his wife may go far beyond the narrow questions about the first ladys conduct as a lawyer which she defends as in whitewater the illinois case places the president and his wife once again in an association with an unsavory wheelerdealer who had strong personal ties to the clintons and even stronger financial ties to the clinton administration in little rock in whitewater the trouble stems from the clintons business relationship with james mcdougal the guiding force behind madison guaranty an arkansas savings and loan that went broke and cost taxpayers more than 47 million fiske will examine whether clinton or his gubernatorial campaign benefited from mcdougals favorable treatment by a state agency in arkansas when clinton was governor in the illinois case the problem stems from the clintons friendship with dan lasater a convicted felon whose highflying bond tradingfirm played a hand in the troubles of several savings and loans including first american savings and loan association an oak brook institution headed by another politician dan walker who was governor of illinois from 1973 to 1977 it all started in 1979 in an unlikely venuethe oaklawn park racetrack in hot springs ark clintons mother the late virginia kelley had a passion for thoroughbred horseracing and her box at the track was next to lasaters an arkansas native who grew up in poverty in kokomo ind lasater started a hamburger chain when he was 19 and was wealthy by the time he met mrs kelley and clintons halfbrother roger at the racetrack in just over twb decades lasater had sold his first hamburger chain moved to arkansas founded the ponderosa steakhouse a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants started a bond trading firm and nurtured his love for horseracing the racetrack friendship soon blossomed into an introduction to clinton who was trying to regain the governors mansion after losing an election in 1980 according to a clinton family friend by early 1983 lasater had given roger clinton a job at his florida horse farm clinton had reclaimed the governors mansion and lasaters bond firm had been added to a list of brokerage firms eligible to underwrite state bond issues a classification that generated millions of dollars in business for his firm according to published reports over the next two years the ties between lasater and the clintons grew stronger the clintons benefited from the relationship lasater contributed money to the governors campaign lent roger clinton 8 000 to pay off a drug debt sponsored fundraising parties at his offices made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts and encouraged his staff to donate to the governors campaign promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations according to published reports at one point in 1985 he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by hillary rodham clinton lasater benefited from the closer ties too in the summer of 1985 clinton successfully lobbied the arkansas legislature to approve a contract for lasater to sell 30 2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system the contract netted lasaters firm 750 000 according to a report in the los angeles times meanwhile lasater spread his financial wings beyond arkansas signing deals to trade treasury bond futures with several savings and loans including walkers first american the s ls were trying to compensate for their moneylosing mortgage lending operations by engaging in the highrisk deals being peddled by lasater but things began to sour in late 1985 both in illinois and in arkansas at first american walker discovered that lasaters bond firm didnt have the magic touch according to court records walkers s l lost at least 361 572 in tbond futures trades made by lasaters firm they had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer each time they made a trade walker said in a telephone interview they did not do that meanwhile law enforcement officers in arkansas had started picking up reports that lasater had another problem he was distrib h9297 uting cocaine to friends and business associ ates at swank parties he threw in little rock and hot springs walker struck first filing a 1985 suit against lasaters bond firm alleging that the company committed mail wire and securities fraud by using first american funds for unauthorized tbond futures trades walker never got lasater in court first american was seized in 1986 by federal officials who later charged the former illinois governor with lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured deposits walker was eventually convicted of bank fraud and perjury federal officials also collared lasater they convicted him of cocaine possession and trafficking in 1986 meanwhile the federal regulators who seized first american decided to pursue the savings and loans 3 3 million suit against lasater to see if they could recoup some money for american taxpayers who funded the billiondollar bailout of hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans including first american the governments deposit insurance fund hired the rose law firm in little rock where hillary clinton was a powerhouse rose had successfully solicited the governments legal work on failed savings and loans in arkansas months earlier the lasater connection caused no end of problems for gov clinton during his reelection campaign in 1986 clinton came under attack from his republican opponent for steering state contracts to lasater while lasater was under investigation for drug trafficking clinton acknowledged being friends with lasater but denied knowing about lasaters drug activities clinton was reelected in 1987 lasater went off to serve his prison sentence after giving patsy thomasson another key clinton supporter and democratic party activist legal authority to manage his assets according to court records most of the rose firms s l legal work was andied by webster hubbel now the no 3 official at the unitedstates justice department but the firm assigned the governments suit against lasater to hillary clinton and vincent foster who later became deputy white house counsel for president clinton and who committed suicide last july in late 1987 court records show hillary clinton and foster negotiated a confidential settlement lasater paid the government 200 000 in return for the dismissal of its 3 3 million suit against him whether lasater got off cheaply at the expense of the american taxpayer depends upon his assets at the time and the strength of the evidence against him legal experts say nevertheless thomas scorza a former assistant unitedstates attorney who teaches legal ethics at the university of chicago law school said hillary clintons decision to represent the government in a lawsuit against lasater raises serious questions about her professional conduct a lawyer is required to represent the interest of their client zealously he said there is a substantial question about whether an attorney was representing a client zealously if the opponent of the client is someone with whom the attorney had a political financial and personal r~lationship in looking at the settlement were they the rose law firm looking after lasaters interests or the interests of the fdic scorza asked hillary clintons office declined to respond to specific questions about the case but issued a general statement defending her legal ethics our view is that hillary clinton when a lawyer at the rose law firm acted with the utmost integrity and professionallsm i have no reason to believe otherwise said her press secretary lisa caputo to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest scorza said hillary clinton should not have worked on the walker s l caseespecially because the final settlement was confidential the tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filing theres no evidence in the court case that the rose law firm or hillary clinton ever disclosed to their client the fdic the ties between tie clintons and lasater or thomasson who was representing lasaters interests at the time of the settlement thomasson who later became executive secretary of the arkansas democratic party is now director of the white house office of administration david barr an fdic spokesman said fdic attorneys are trying to locate records on first american to see if the rose law firm notified the fdic about any potential conflict of interest a law firm can be banned from receiving further work from the fdic and the resolution trust corp which disposes the assets of failed s ls if it misleads fdic officials about a possible conflict of interest barr said the first american case isnt the only problem for the firm which hillary clinton left before her husband assumed the presidency the fdic is trying to determine whether the rose firm misled federal regulators about a potential conflict of interest when the firm represented the deposit insurance fund against the accountants who worked for madison guaranty hillary clinton had represented madison the savings and loan at the heart of whitewater in addition fdic officials are looking into the case of home federal savings and loan of centralia another failed illinois institution which is very similar to the first american case it is not known whether hillary clinton was directly involved in the home federal case the rose law firm represented home federal in a 4 6 million suit against lasaters company for unauthorized trading but what is unusual about this case is that lasater too was represented by an attorney with ties to rose king betz former president of home federal said he initially hired the rose law firm because the claims in his suit were nearly identical to those in the first american case he said that vince foster was the lead attorney in the case and that he had no contact with hillary clinton after the government took over home federal it continued the case meanwhile though thomas mars a rose attorney who had worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first american suit against lasater left the rose firm months later he started representing lasater against home federal which was still represented by rose legal experts say the rose law firm should have notified betz and the fdic ab6ut mars potential conflict of interest because mars worked on the first american suit he could have had inside information that gave him an advantage in negotiating a settlement for lasater in the home federal suit betz says foster never told him about lasaters ties to the clintons he also failed to advise betz about mars potential conflict of interest betz said foster advised him to accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlement in we were told by the attorneys that we were not going to get any more money said betz who agreed to the settlement when told that mars had previously worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first federal case betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information mars denied any wrongdoing tnere was nothing funny going on everything was always on the up and up everything was done in a businesslikemanner he said"],

tonight there is nothing more frustrating here than having to interrupt your thoughts as the clock is chasing you i want to continue what i have just loosely called the clinton years part 3 and begin tonight with something from yesterdays wall street journal that i found very disturbing it is a description of the fine state of arkansas that matches something i tried to describe in this well in september and in october of the election year 1992 there is a newsletter that has just come into my possession by kevin phillips published by the american political research corporation it is called the american political report the headline is whitewater the politics of a second watergate when you say this to anyone in the dominant media culture who is a gentleman and admits they are liberal a lady of the same honor and they are rare most of them claim that they are perched on some olympian peak of moderate perfection when you mention in the same breath whitewater or watergate or refer to whitewater as white watergate as does the great columnist for the new york times bill safire they go ballistic on you here are some of the subtitles in kevin phillips american political report clinton whitewater and the polls and the polls are moving severely against mr clinton the clinton scandals a 20th century political perspective i will come back to that the hillary rodham factor the clinton scandals in the midterm elections that is a fascinating part 4 june congressional hearings on whitewater it may be a lot sooner than june after what happened in this house today by a vote of 408 to 15 the house of representatives the peoples great chamber has joined that 98 to 0 vote in the unitedstates senate to start hearings as soonas possible six clinton legal vulnerabilities this is a nightmare for the white house obstruction of justice shredding of evidence intimidating or offering payment to witnesses or offering promotions jobs to arkansas troopers which was not mentioned in

as one columnist observed a modified hangout watergate term stunned by more bad news the president tries to change the subject tonight on all three networks particularly on cbs they devoted about 10 minutes on the cbs show to all of the various whitewater stories breaking today on abc they described the vote of this house today to hold hearings as the democrats conceded to and then the reporter took a deliberate dramatic pause and said to do the best we could because we do not have specific dates yet or anything really substantial on whenwe are going to have the hearings the los angeles times which remember has 4 of the arkansas 10 troopers that were talking 4 on tape recording here is the l a times of yesterday a story correctly predicting what would happen today in little rock exmunicipal judge accused of fraud tries to implicate clinton david hales trial begins next week in a case related to whitewater of course he plea bargained today interesting that the unitedstates attorney down there in little rock paula casey could have had him plea bargain months ago this all would be much further advanced maybe some of it is resolved to the clintons satisfaction if she had not stonewalled former judge david hales offer to plea bargain and tell all and then after she had stopped him and demanded that he go to trial then she recused herself as having a biased background on the whole whitewater mess here is todays l a times clinton treasury aide given early briefing on failed arkansas thrift political appointee roger altman was told that the madison guaranty s l case would go to the justice department he is also a regulator raising a possible conflict beneath that another story republicans had planned to raise the whitewater issue at hearings on thursday chairman

we do not know if that 408 to 15 vote today is going to grow into a select panel but if it does it will be more of a jungle out there for the white house as a matter of fact when i pick up the papers these days an old beatles tune always rings in my head i saw the news today oh boy now here is the wall street journal yesterday rose law firm will file ethics complaint in arkansas about hubbells expenses that is webster hubbell best golf buddy of bill clinton the rose law firm has decided to file a complaint with the arkansas ethics authorities about undocumented expenses incurred by former associate attorney general webster hubbell how can they blame that on the republicans of course they cannot it is impossible as i said in my special orders last week walk out the hall here a few steps to the statutory hall which was the house chamber for 50 years from 1807 to 1857 and statue number 7 around to your left in between jeffersn davis the senator from mississippi who became the president of the 10 breakaway confederate states and on the other side is robert fulton of steamboat invention fame and there is one of the two statues from arkansas that every state is allowed to put in this incredible building the worlds greatest governmental building ever there is the distinguished face and form of uriah rose the founder of the rose law firm an appointee to the geneva convention at the turn of the century around 1908 by 1908 president teddy roosevelt was the first president of the american bar association and that rose firm was the first firm west of the mississippi when arkansas was just a frontier state it is really tragic what has happened to the 60 partners down there now that they are going to find themselves possibly as some columnists suggest in a state of bankruptcy within months what a tragedy that the four partners coming to washington what is now being called the gang of four hillary rodham webster hubble vince foster dead since july 20 and now william kennedy william kennedy hi no relation to the massachusetts kennedy family here is the wall street journal article from today kennedy clintons ethics gatekeeper hasnt paid taxes on nannys wages before white house associate counsel william kennedy 3i became a clinton gatekeeper on ethical issues he worked for nussbaum who has resigned under a cloud who had on his desk a parody of james carville clintons campaign managers theme sign about staying on message it is the economy stupid and nussbaum had on his desk it is the ethics stupi that sign must have fallen on its face when they were all conducting these midnight raids into vince fosters office it says kennedy became a clinton gatekeeper on ethics yet he had a hidden problem of his own unpaid taxes owed on a nannys wages but he disclosed it to only one person in the clinton camp surprise surprise vincent foster the deputy white house counsel who died july 20th notice very few of the papers say committed suicide they say alleged suicide or who died i may be naive but i am still clinging to the theory of suicide because anything else is so shakespearian i will be on this floor if there is ever a murder or even an indication of the body being moved i will be on this floor calling for the resignation merciful resignation of the clinton team from the white house that is for sure here is the headline of the distinguished washington times gonzalez gives in calls for hearings hale might hold pieces to the whitewater puzzle grand jury likely to hear of clintons depis it is interesting that hale might be the john dean of this breaking scandal the first one who comes forward and tells all to save himself dean went to jail it looks like hale if going to jail for 10 years maybe with good behavior he will get 5 but this thing grows exponentially here is a column i meant to put in the record from last week when i spoke on st patricks day and the following day in defense of arkansas it says it is time to come to thedefense of arkansas recently maligned with an image of a closeknit political circle of mutual back scratching in this department little rock as nothing on washington dc with webb hubble leaving the justice department jamie gorelick is about to arrive ms gorelicks nomination which went before the senate last week was fascinating because of all the people she has defended clark clifford and robert altman not roger no relation i believe i had better check that out on the first american bank where they worked when it was secretly owned by the bank of credit and commerce international or bccl one of the largest banking scandals in this country guess what i found out who writes these fascinating articles in the wall street journal it is robert bartley he was unflappable on meet the press sunday before the guns of david broder and company he has said to folks that since mlichael kingsley and others accused him on nightline excuse me on crossfire and in print in the new republic that he was one of the proximate causes of a suicide namely vince foster that he said what do these people expect me to do dry up and blow away or to defend my honor here is an article that i think is going to be probably the most quoted over the next months from what i have always goodnaturedly called a schizophrenic magazine because most of the reporters are liberal like michael kingsley and yet fred barnes is one of its senior editors and that is the new republic wait until i read what the new republic says about the scandals interlocking in arkansas by l j davis here it is so powerful it is quoted in a long editorial the longest i have seen yet in any paper in the wall street journal obviously written by robert bartley and i will cut to the chase here and read the part that fascinated me because i had said the same thing on the house floor over 1 year and 7 months ago arkansas mr davis l j davis writes in the new republic a liberal moderate magazine there is a close resemblance to a third world country with a ruling oligarchy a small and relatively powerless middle class a disenfranchised leaderless populace the wall street journal says this kind of civic culture we see in many actual third world countries i have witnessed it all through the torments of central and south america over many trips down there when i was on the committee on foreign affairs a decade ago we see this kind as likely to produce a spoilstothevictor abovethelaw approach to government that is to say the kind of careless arrogance we have seen in the handling of whitewater in the white house passes in webb hubbles law firm billings in travelgate in intervention into an ongoing corruption trial in the handling of vince fosters death and in the handling of various individuals including zoe baird kimba wood lannie gunier and chris emory a white house usher dismissed over phone conversations with barbara bush over how to set up her computer home laptop computer with no warning and less than a weeks notice chris emory longtime white house usher turned into the street whitewater is not merely about a land deal the wall street journal continues it is about all of these things and about the place they are bidding the clintons to assume in washington which god knows is guilty of enough sins of its own and above all it is about hypocrisy say that one after another the explanations are innocent hilary was lucky in commodities and unlucky in land speculation wishing they had lost money jim blair and patsy thomason are just friends she was on the hill today more about that later james and susan macdougal and david hale and dan lassiter are just former friends lay aside all suspicions and accept every cover story we are now supposed to believe that bill clinton was elected president to reform the sins of the highflying 1980s yes the key word there is hypocrisy here is something that my friend senator doi nickles sent over he is chairman of the senate republican policy committee as i have been chairman for 2 years over here a few years ago of the republican study committee he sent over documentation that i would like to include in the record at this point about all of the 25 separate allegations of ethical or legal wrongdoing that were turned into hearings and or investigations during the reagan and bush administration despite the presence of at least five separate instances or allegations of wrong during the clinton administration and senator nickles lists them congress has yet to conduct a single hearing or the slightest investigation on three occasions during the reagan administration congressional committees conducted investigations or hearings concurrent with investigations by an independent counsel four of 19 congressional hearings or investigations conducted during the reagan administration were led by the thenrepublican controlled committees of the united states senate which was from 1981 through 1986 under republican control a recent opinion poll revealed that 60 percent of those surveyed believe whitewater requires a fullscale federal investigation here are the areas where republicans in the senate feel there should be or should have been investigations scandal one travelgate i have here an article a good column by mark r levin that says whatever happened to travelgate why did that disappear this is last week he opens up with a

erosion of support among middle americans that is to say americans of middleincome for the clinton health care bill and for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller pass health care regardless of the views of the american people i would hope we would not handle it that way i do hope instead of a legislative version of blindmans bluff we will get at least 30 days to read any health care bill that will come forth for a vote"], [0.0008653252152726054, 0.0008653252152726054, 0, "i hope the members back in their offices

of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the

member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and

tentative agreement forced upon the republican party in this congress on the whitewater investigations what has happened is the democrat majority has said the only way we are going to have hearings in either the house or the senate is if it is very structured and very limited they want to limit it to three things the death of vincent foster the removal by the white house personnel immediately after his death of files from his office and white house attempts to influence the resolution trust corporation investigation of mr and mrs clintons role in the arkansas s l but the investigation by the house and the senate should be much much broader i wantto tell my colleagues whr first of all there are questions about mr fiske the special prosecutors objectivity mr fiske was a very close associate at various times when theywere both in new york practicing law with bernie nussbaum one of the chief advisers to president clinton as a matter of fact mr fiske the special prosecutor special investigator in this case tried to get mr nussbaum appointed assistant counsel during the irancontra investigation mr fiskes law firm represented the international paper co which got a 10 million loan from the arkansas development finance authority in arkansas his firm also represented the international paper co during the time when they sold hundreds of acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske recommended louis freeh now head of the fbi to be the head of the fbi to mr nussbaum at the white house so there is some question about whether there will be complete thoroughness on the part of mr fiske and his staff in investigating the white house allegations but beyond that there is a lot of other things that need to be investigated because more and more is coming out daily first of all why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon a convicted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 dan lasater pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in december 1988 but he served only 6 months of a 2 2year sentence while he was reportedly under investigation by the arkansas state police for drug dealing president clinton and the government of arkansas gave him 664 million in bonds to sell for the state which garnered him 1 6 million in commissions why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon copvcted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 after all this involvement with him and they gave big contributions to clintons campaign he is thenpardoned for cocaine trafficking was it because dan lasater was a large contributor was it because dan lasater had flown the governor around arkansas and the country in his private jet was it because dan lasater gave roger clinton president clintons brother a job at his florida horse stables and loaned him 8 000 to pay back a drug debt did bill clinton know about the lasater investigation and lasaters drug use at the time he gave him 664 million in state bonds to sell according to published accounts and mr dennis patrick between wo million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without his knowledge that may have involved laundering of drug money one day 23 million was traded in his account patsy thomasson the chief personnel officer at the white house was running lasater co she was chief financial officer at the time now she is special assistant to the president of the united states where did this money come from where did it go did ms thomasson know about these transactions i do not know how she could not have there are of course other things that need to be explained in 1985 the arkansas development finance authority was created by bill clinton to provide economic development loans to small businesses in arkansas a number of serious questions have been raised about adfa which need to be investigated listen to this on december 29 1988 adfa deposited 50 million in a bank in the cayman islands why are you taking money out of the state of ar kansas and putting it in the cayman islands this money was transferred through simmons first national bank of pine bluff ar why did adfa deposit 50 million in an offshore bank instead of a bank in some other part of the country or in arkansas the interest rates were approximately the same the state departments international narcotics control report described the cayman islands as a haven for the laundering of drug money and here is the arkansas development finance authority sending 50 million down there was the 50 million plus interest repaid to adfa right now we do not have any documentation as to whether it was ever repaid we do not know what happened to it did the arkansas development fixiance authority make any other offshore deposits and for what reasons public documents show that adfa was steering millions of dollars in bond underwriting business to lasater and his company who i said before was convicted for drug dealing why would adfa give all of this business to lasater co while dan lasater the companys president was under federal investigation for narcotics trafficking i the american people need to knowthe answers to these questions and we are very very concerned that mr fiske may limit the investigation so that we never get the answers if somebody at the white house was involved in the laundering of drug money then we should have a full accounting it should be explained to this body and to the american people and if there is no reason to believe that then why does not the white house patsy thomasson and everybody else come forward mr fiske and give us the ability to investigate it so we can clear up

and bob dornan of california about some new revelations into whitewaterrelated activities as reported today in the washington times and i would like to expand a little bit on the story and i hope everybody will bear with me a little bit because it is a very convoluted involved story that leads everyone who knows something about it to believe that there needs to be a complete congressional investigation involving whitewater as well as possible drugrelated transactions a fellow named jerry seper of the washington times wrote and i am going to quote the first paragraph whitewater madison investigators are looking at a little rock investment firm owned by a convicted cocaine dealer to find out if drug profits were laundered through banks and other financial outlets and later masked as campaign contributions to arch governor bill clinton now what he is talking about here and i will jump through a lot of this is a fellow who is named dan lasater mr lasater is a businessman who is very successful he started a company called lasater co and mr lasater has been involved in business down in arkansas for a long time now mr lasater was a major contributor financial supporter of bill clinton as well as a personal friend throughout much of bill clintons political career during the time that bill clinton was governor and running for reelection as i said mr lasater gave him major contributions and major financial support mr lasater in 1986 was indicted and convicted of dealing in drugs and he received a 30month jail sentence he was believed to have been involved in not only drugs but laundering drug money at the same time bill clintons brother was involved in this alleged scheme and he was convicted as well mr lasater did not go to prison he spent 4 months in a halfway house and then i think he had 2 months under house arrest and then in 1990 bill clinton pardoned mr lasater and mr lasater after being pardoned became the chairman of the board of the phoenix mortgage co at that time a lady named patsy thomasson who had been associated with mr lasater and bill clinton she was also at that time in the late eighties and early nineties head of the democrat party in arkansas miss thomasson was the executive vice president of the lasater co and when mr lasater was indicted and convicted she took over as the chief executive officer and ran the company in his absence when mr lasater was pardoned by bill clinton miss thomasson became the president of the phoenix group so she was an associate of mr lasater before during and after his conviction for drug crimes now mr lasater while he was being investigated by the state police of arkansas for being involved in cocaine trafficking received a 664 million bond contract from the state of arkansas signed by the governor and he made 1 3 million off of this transaction this was during the time he was being investigated and later convicted for drug trafficking now a fellow named dennis patrick who was county court clerk in kentucky and this is a convoluted story so please bear with me it is hard to follow was contacted by an old schoolmate named steven love and mr love worked for mr lasaterin his brokerage house in arkansas mr love had gone to school with mr patrick and they were close friends he called ir patrick and said he wanted to take him on a fishing and hunting trip all eipenses paid on a private jet to an exotic place he was going to tell him how he could make a lot of money mr patrick went with him during the trip mr love told him that he was going to try to help him to set him up and help him make at least 20 000 a month from bond transactions mr patrick thought this was very interesting but he did not think anything would come of it a month later mr love called him and told him he had made 20 000 and he ought to come down to arkansas to visit him and the lasater firm because he had been the beneficiary of this 20 000 he had not invested anything he had not signed anything but he thought if i made 20 000 i would even get on skates and go down there he went down to arkansas mr love called over to the first american bank to somebody he knew over there and told them that he was sending mr patrick over there and they were opening up an account for 20 000 for him mr patrick went over and signed some papers opening up this account after that subsequent to that mr lasaters firm started running through patrick associates dennis patricks company bond transactions these bond transactions ultimately over the next 2 years 3 years amounted to between 60 and 107 million mr patrick did not know anything about them he did not know anything about them until later when two of the principals in the agency of the lassister co came to visit him and left him with some documents that he did not understand they were bond transactions these bonds were transferred without his approval and nobody knows where the money came from to buy the bonds and the 107 million was transferred to the security pacific bank branch in new york and first american bank inlittle rock mr patrick did not know anything about it he did not know where the money came from he did not know who bought the bonds but he did find out subsequently that these transactions had taken place and the money went into mr lasaters account i mr lasater as i said went to jail patsy thomasson was the chief financial officer for that company so that she had to know about these financial transactions patsy thomasson for those who do not know is now the director of the presidents administration at the white house she runs the white house today she is the lady that was the executive officer running this company or in large part during the time that this 197 million in bond transactions took place it is very possible very possible that this money was drug money that was being laundered through buying unitedstates treasury bonds and then sold through these two banks security pacific bank and first national first american and the money was then going into mr lassiters account we believe we think that it is real possible very possible that patsy thomasson knew about these transactions she is one of the lead principles in the white house the director of administration running the clinton white house we think that this alone is reason enough to have a congressional investigation there is so much involved in this that it almost becomes hard to follow my colleagues and i have been working on this all day long but i would like to show to my colleagues copies of the transactions that took place these bond transactions that took place in 1985 and 1986 they just came to the attention of the media and the congress today they are related to the entire whitewater scandal this congress needs to have hearings on this we know there is an investigation going on with the special counsel many are concerned that this is not going to get the complete hearing that it should with the special counsels investigation we are not trying to impugn the integrity of the special counsel we do believe he had close ties mr fiske had close ties and has had close ties with mr nussbaum who used to be at the white house we know that for a fact because they had legal dealings together on a number of cases we know mr fiske represented the international paper co and international paper sold several hundred acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske is investigating all of this in order to make sure that mr fiske does his job properly as well as the congress does its job in conducting its oversight requirement under the constitution we believe that congressional investigations are absolutely necessary here is a man who was convicted of dealing in drugs here is a man who was pardoned by the nowpresident of the united states here is a man who during the time he was under investigation by the arkansas state police got 664 million in state bond contracts from which he made 1 3 million here is a man who was very close to the president of the united states was a major major contributor and went everyplace with the president as i said before he was pardoned patsy thomasson who is one of president clintons righthand persons at the white house and has been for a long long time the head of the demo crat party in arkansas during his administration she was tied to lassiter before during and after the tinie he was convicted of drug dealing she was running his company when all of these bond transactions 107 million took place and nobody knows from when the money came but they know the money was transferred through dennis patricks account he did not know anything about it so it must have been an illegal transaction that should be investigated by the irs and the fbi the money went to mr lassiter and his account in these two banks i alluded to earlier in order for us to vindicate the president get all of this cleared up in order for us to vindicate and clear up patsy thomassons relations with mr lasater in order for us to protect dennis patrick and i might add that dennis patricks life has been not only threatened they tried to kill him three times since all of this took place the man has been in hiding with his family because he is afraid he is going to be killed he was in to see us today in order to protect him we need to have congressional hearings it is absolutely imperative this goes beyond whitewater it goes into drug trafficking it goes into money laundering it goes into all kinds of things in order for this president to be able to do his job effectively we think this all needs to be cleared up the only way it is going to be cleared up is through a dongressional investigation let m say one more thing and then i will yield to my colleague the gentleman from california that is this some people will say this is political i think it goes way beyond politics but we must look back to the reagan and bush administration when things that were of much less consequence than this much less consequence than this to the american people were investigated by congressional hearings there were 23 congressional hearings during the bush and reagan administrations and every time we asked for anything any information relating to whitewater or anything else we were stonewalled by the administration and the entire executive branch it was that way in the ron brown affair and it is that way in whitewater and we believe it is going to be that way in this drug investigation we are talking about right now and the possible money laundering i say to my colleagues and to anybody else who is paying attention this is a very serious matter it deserves congressional oversight it deserves congressional investigation it is our responsibility as a congress to look into this i would say to my colleagues let u get on with it if it was a republica administration we would have don this months ago it is a democrat ad ministration and let us do the

extensively on what the troopers had to say about womanizing and a certain southern governor again ie has only two troopers out of five listed moving on imagine going before the elite of the national press and the white house press corps as carville did at this breakfast and showing a chart with gennifer flowers and sally perdue on it gennifer flowers released tapes and she is marketing hours more of the tapes that are pretty darn incriminating sally perdus said oh he the person in question smoked marijuana all of the time because it increased his aggressiveness what are they doing on a chart that carville brings before the press this food chair was lightly reported upon by the way most americans are hearing this for the first time in this 1 200 000 audience that watches cspan then he has on there rev jerry fawell from liberty baptist college then he has on there reed irvine a solid american who spent most of his years in federal service retired and then founded a great organization that i vigorously endorse accuracy in media he says these six sources the tw o troopers the twowomen confessing adulterous affairs a judge who is under indictment and who copped a plea to two or three felonies a media watchdog and a reverend that they feed believe it or not cliff jackson a fulbright scholar at oxford during the 2 years clinton was also supposed to be there attending school remember clinton never got his degree from oxford add then there damato and sheffield nelson who i guess is running again for governor of arkansas he ran against clinton in 1990 johnsonsmnick this is the consulting firm whos newsletter caused the stock market to drop when it reported on some of the speculation surrounding vince forters suicide 0 1530 then they have got me bob dornan hence my special order tonight then they have floyd brown who runs an organization with david bossie out in virginia that accumulates a world of material on everything that comes under the heading of whitewater so he has got me right up there with fulltime investigators the current gubernatorial candidate in arkansas a dc consulting firm and a charter friend of bill from those 2 years in england when he clinton was avoiding the draft three times then we all the aforementioned sup posedly feed the star that is the tabloid that published about a fifth of the gennifer flowers tapes published written transcripts we also feed rush limbaugh and we feed british tabloids which by the way are not tabloids in the sense that we would describe the star or the national inquirer but are more newspapers like the sunday telegraph by the way the sunday telegraph ran a story a week ago sunday front page on cocaine use in arkansas and tying cocaine use to the presidents half brother roger clinton i am told roger clintons band was called dealers choice since roger clinton had legal trouble over cocaine use i think it is fair to assume there may have been more than a little double entendrein theiname of his musical group dealers choice i think it probably was a little play on words to an inside joke about his highflying cocaine use with another friend of bill bill lasater whose former associate is the current head of the administration of the white house patsy thomasson all of them are charged in this british newspaper by the way an interesting footnote england does not have the robust freewheeling interpretation of free speech rights that we have under our first amendment many american performers have sued british newspapers for libel and walked away with millions there was this frontpage story a week ago accusing a sitting president of using cocaine when he was attorney general and governor i think president clinton instead of for the first time in american history setting up a legal fund to take in money to fight charges of sexual harassment i think mr clinton should take some of those highpowered lawyers and them to london get involved with some british barristers and sue the sunday telegraph for this cocaine story a week ago sunday if successful he would have the millions of dollars he needs to cover his mounting legal fees for the paula jones case and have some left over to help out on whitewater interesting concept perfectly valid next to the british tabloids is a very hardcharging talk show host g gordon liddy he is on about a hundred stations rush limbaugh on the same line is on about 650plus stations so that pretty well covers america then those people feed the washington times one of the nine best papers in america the alternative i like to think untruthful press here in washington dc the new york post which was running exclusive stories under chris ruddys byline who i bumped into in the hall downstairs he is an aggressive young new york post reporter now working the hill scene then the american spectator and its great founder publisher editor bob tyrrell who was i thought stupidly and viciously attacked last night on nbcs dateline they kept saying you accused the president of adultery and bob tyrrell would say no you keep getting it wrong i am a reporter i reported the accusations of the five troopers then there is the new republic a schizophrenic magazine with a great conservative senior editor fred barnes and an ultraliberal friend of mine michael kinsley the dashing nowbearded host of crossfire when i shaved my beard last week kinsley saw an opportunity and he started growing one i must say michael you look marvelous excuse me for addressing kinsley directly you tell him he looks marvelous with that new beard then the wall street journal editorial page going after bob bartley there so there is james carvilles food chain he says all of these various levels feed the poor pathetic mainstream american press which just gobbles up all of this stuff and then report it to the america people what a bunch of baloney if you turned this chart upside down it would be more accurate so i decided to do my own flow chart to detail who really gets information from whom around here i am sorry i do not have a bigger version but let me translate this for you what starts a real media food chain in america well it starts off with people seeking the truth is that not what journalism is all about and i will jump cut to the chase here it ends up with the american people digesting all of this and with an unbelievable historical sense of fairness determining what is correct and what is not the liberal dominant media culture throws most of it in the ash can for example last night and this morning except for the great job done by my republican whip newt gingrich on one of the morning talkinghead shows the bias demonstrated last night in analysis particularly on pbs and even worse on public radio today about the watergateexcuse me freudian slip the whitewater hearingswas appalling it is just the most offensive leftwing media bias i have ever seen in my life so let us look at the real media food chain you start with the truth now up here on line 1 i will agree with carville it is exjudge david hale all five troopers roger perry larry peterson danny ferguson ronnie anderson and l d brown ferguson is the one name along with bill clinton on the sexual harassment suit of paula jones ronnie anderson have five children and three of them are triplets i kind of give him an excuse pass he went on the record with the american spectator and with the l a times and then went underground with five kids he has got a right to protect his income and there is j d brown the hottest of all the troopers sheffield nelson we have moved up from line 2 to the top line how did carville forget good old jim mcdougal who just did terribly in a congressional primary down in arkansas and his wife susan mcdougal who is probably going to start to sing like a canary when they go to settle the suit against her by zubin mehta out in california totally separate scandal where she allegedly ripped off the great musical impresario who brings us those three great tenors placido domingo carreras and pavarotti that is the same man that susan mcdougal is accused of bilking for 300 00 or 400 000 then there is sally perdue bobby ann williams marilyn joe jenkins and the list of about 20 other women who have a story to tell they are still popping up all over the landscape flowers is in a category by herself she taperecorded him and there is paula jones carville forgot to put paula jones on the media food chain chart i guess she wasnt on the radar screen them these people tell their stories then it is analyzed by investigative reporters chris ruddy and by jlm leach jim leach and his excellent staff do work that feeds me information the same for al da mato they are both on the banking committee they both have relevant congressional positions from which they can investigate some of these things then there is jerry seper of the washington times an aggressive excellent reporter i wish everyone in america could subscribe to the washington times to get their front page truth accurate reporting on all matters coming under whitewater then there is l j davis who did a tremendous reporting job in the new republic he said he was knocked on the head with some sort of a blunt instrument that knocked him out for an hour or more when he concluded his reporting in arkansas then there is david brock the tremendous young reporter for the american spectator give him a name credit on the line then there is floyd brown and dave bossie whose name i forgot to add and then there is bill remple and doug franz of the l a times they were on nightline one night these two investigative reporters for one of my hometown papers the los angeles times one of them slipped in describing the troopers talking about the veracity of the first four troopers one of them said we believe completely our troopers whose troopers arkansass troopers no the l a times troopers remple and franz troopers franz and remple had tape recorded material that jack nelson the washington dc senior editor for the l a times would love to destroy if he could get his hands on it i believe remple and franz have trooper danny ferguson on tape so vividly and so clearly that if they were ever to release it to the electronic media or at least to the printmedia i believe that the paula jones case would soar back to the front pages and clinton would probably have to resign the presidency this presidency is in the hands of the l a times now all these folks give their information gleaned from these sources here at the top to the new york post the british dailieswhich is a more accurate name than tabloidto the wall street journal editorial page bartley gigot and company to the washington times to the new republic to the american spectator and to the l a times notice my name has not appeared yet i am not on the inside in this investigation like mr leach and"], [0.0008960296399891376, 0.0008960296399891376, 0, "today i rise to express my opposition in the strongest terms to the proposal being offered today by bill clinton and the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise to the american people as he has broken so many other promises in his short tenure mr clinton does not understad one basic factamericans are not undertaxedcongress is spending too much in my view bil clinton sold the american voter a bill of goods i am afraid that this president who received only 43 percent of the popular vote and this congress do not understand

fair to you because you enjoyed this inspi rational trip to normandy with me and we got to be good friends but let me just reemphasize some of the points on dr elders who seems to have a lock on her job partly i guess because of the dumping of lani guanier another lady of africanamerican descent who had been appointed to something and then clinton her friend from law schocl at yale suddenly discovered her writings he said and jerked her ap pointment i did a 1minute speech today that i titled in the minefield the electoral minefield that clinton has to go through the next year and a half that the most explosive mine under the ground is dr elders she is the one who can blow his lights out i have before me again this bob novak column from today and i want to underscore some of the things we missed during the fourway discussion bob novak writes and he was terrific on crossfire tonight i might add president clinton has rejected requests from the catholic archbishop of washington to disavow surgeon general joycelyn elders comments about sexuality signalling that she must be treated with kid gloves no matter how embarrassing her statements the reason i want to do this is on the show our distinguished colleague vic fazio said he never heard of these letters this correspondence between the catholic cardinal the archbishop of washington dc and all the surrounding environs that make up a betterthanyouraverage diocese and archdiocesel he said he never heard of it so he is going to hear about it tomorrow with all the dates because i am going to give him this article tomorrow we are friends i will give him the transcript of this colloquy tonight for some speed readings senior clinton officials and i continue novak have to follow suit finessing options that dr elders is apt to offer whenever she testifies before congress when she recently said that more federal funds should be spent on aids than on cancer is that the victims are younger her superiors rolled their eyes bur could not reprimand her to quote a highranking official the president feels very strongly about joycelyn elders hence the reason he has not disowned what she said while he was gone but he backs everything she is saying thats a clue to whats wrong with the clinton presidency novak goes on he named as surgeon general of the united states somebody her own colleagues admit is unqualified and undisciplined but as an african american woman up from poverty and out of arkansas elders need not worry about her job cardinal james hickey of washington found that out in a correspondence with clinton it began when hickey learned that the surgeon general interviewed by a gay publication the advocate endorsed homosexual adoptions and called homosexual sex normal and healthy novak left out that she said particularly for young people on march 21 the cardinal wrote to the president to take strong exception to elders criticism of how religious leaders view human sexuality hickey accused the surgeon general of encouraging life style which puts socalled homosexual unions on a partisan with marriage and family and condoms homosexual behavior among young people he then asked the president publicly to disavow elders remarks he goes on that was not an easy letter for clinton to answer how to balance gays homosexuals and blacks against traditional catholics on may 6 six weeks later i find that insulting as a runofthemill catholic he replied that he is committed to building a society that promotes tolerance and acceptance ofdiversity guess he still wants to shove homosexuals who are active into places in the military now this is clintons words issues such as homosexual marriage are left to the individual states and are not under the jurisdiction of the federal government the cardinal responded may 16 within a few days that contrary to the clinton formulation dr elders as a federal official continues to advocate a redefinition of the family clinton is a little faster this time 18 days later he responds with clintons june 3 reply he recited all is administration had done for the family starting with the family leave act but left the cardinal unsatisfied monsignor william lori speaking for hickey told this column one can only really conclude from both letters from mr clinton that dr elders is truly speaking for the administration i have a feeling that she is speaking for hillary rodham clinton but i guess it appears she is also speaking for her friend from arltansas bill clinton in the midst of this correspondence elders before the senate committee may 11 to be asked why the government plans to spend more against the number 9 killer aids than against number 1 cancer and number 2 heart disease her answer was stunning and i think it is distasteful when talk show hosts kind of mock her accent 0 2050 so i will just kind of read this straight she says we know that aids is a ravishing disease in our country that is destroying our bright young people i feel that if we do not find a vaccine if we do not find a good drug by the way thank god she is not saying cure there never will be a cure not when that little infinitesimal hiv virus is locked inside those helper t cells no way are we ever going to get that out that is beyond science for millions of years but she wants that vaccine or to find a good drug how that is going to help africa which has no pharmacies i do not know she says if we dont we are going to lose our entire society so there is threat again of heterosexual aids transmission whipping through the whole of society and all of that has been disproven elders continues most of the people who die with heart disease and cancer are our elderly population you know and we will all probably die with something sooner or later what probably it is an inevitability what is she saying sometimes her mind just wonders off how did she get through medical school now what does the assistant secretary her boss assistant secretary for health the respected bob novak says dr philip lee say he quotes a lot of things that joycelyn says i dont agree with but i still respect her right to say them blah blah blah blah i dont look at whether this will affect older people or younger people i myself i look at whether this is an area where we can make progress in dealing with disease unquote dr philip lee novak continues elders highsounding job is low in the chain of command subordinate to both health and human services secretary donna shalala and subordinate to dr philip lee but they had no part in selecting the surgeon general and cannot discipline her now for all of her failings joycelyn elders is an appealing compassionate person whom administration officials the president included would prefer to have had concentrate on antismoking and antiteenage pregnancy campaigns the reality is that dr elders is out of control and nothing will be done about it and this tells usmuch about the presidency 50 years ago today our colleague bob michel of illinois the republican leader was with his 9th division fighting on the cotentine penin sula the cherbourg peninsula up on the outskirts of cherbourg the german defenders were digging in the unitedstates loss of life was tremendous the british still had not gotten into caen which we drove through several times from deauville going to and from the very moving and thought provoking 50th anniversary commemorations along the bleach of utah normandy gold juneau seward the british took st honorina i wonder if that means st honore the beautiful little city on the coast where henry v landed meanwhile in the pacific which i talked about last night i put in some material on saipan in the record last night it is in todays record the united states marines japanese troops fought viciously on the slopes of saipans mt tapotchau tapotchau we all know omaha beach and we all know about iwo jima but a lot of americans died on mt tapotchau meanwhile in the biat caves an island that most americans do not know about let alone young people in the biat 6aves the fighting went on we had the upper hand but meanwhile the japanese troops on the mainland of new guinea inflicted serious and heavy losses on american forces fighting in the sarmi sarmi area 50 years ago and that is why i would like to close by asking to put in the record a column from last sundays new york times june 19 by maureen dowd i never met this reporter she has called me a couple of times for a brief quote she has a column i guess it is every week called dowd dowd maureen dowd on washington this one she simply calls beached and it brings back some memories of our trip to normandy it was cold and rainy as the normandy invasion started and nothing was going as planned as we hit the beaches helen thomas was in the lead charging off the aircraft carrier george washington with toothbrush and tape recorder sam donaldson provided air cover in a chinook helicopter hovering over the english channel general hillary as a british paper dubbed her arrived on the field of battle with her hairdresser sylvan one word never mind destiny president clinton has a rendezvous with wolf blitzer the boys of point du hoc scaled their cliff under german fire in bad weather on june 6 1994 but the boys on the bus never made it to pointe du hoc at all on june 6 1994 the white house press corps missed the presidents speech because their helicopters turned back because of bad weather and the backup buses did not leave in time to get to the coast from the landing at le havre the reporters stranded at collevillesurmer were in a panic the clinton lieutenants who pride themselves on their hightech virtuosity said calmly that they would play a tape of the pointe du hoc speech but when they put the tape in and clinton began to speak no words came out the sound a white house official explained helpfully is coming later by bus the fog of war had given way to the fog of white house amateurism as yuppies retraced the steps of heroes one thing was certain midway into the first term the clinton white house has not yet gotten the knack of smoothly moving around hundreds of grouchy journalists who pay handsomely to be ferried by the government with comic timing worthy of evelyn waugh the white house kept losing people tom brokaw said he was 2 hours late for an interview with the president because army helicopter pilots delivering him sam donaldson and harry smith and cbs to the aircraft carrier where clinton was spending the night g~t lost and could not find the largest ship in the world after flying aimlessly over the english channel for 45 minutes the pilots got low on gas and had to return to the airstrip in deauville call the ship for coordinates and start again the navy was vastly amused another day the white house marooned 24 reporters and staffers in the misty british countryside for 12 hours unable to figure out a way to get our group 10o miles from cambridge to portsmouth the next stop on the presidents schedule i drove it the day before along with my wife and walked in eisenhowers steps it is funny that i did not have this problem a furious a p radio reporter was filing reports on a president he could only see on the relly in the churchill pub where the press had been dumped white house aides paced the tarmac scanning the skies for a missing helicopter and screamed into cellular phones with dying batteries i tried to call my boss in portsmouth to warn him i would miss my deadline but the instructions on the pay phone were in british sipping the champagne ordered by the paris march reporter i fantasized about replacing the corner dart board with the head of one of clintons prepubescent pressminders things were no better in paris after the state dinner at the elysee palace the photographers were told that there would be a photo opportunity by a bridge where the first couple would stroll hand in hand and gaze at the eiffel tower at midnight take that paula jones but when theclintons got out of their limousine near the pont desarts the bridge of arts it was not exactly an intimate moment they were surrounded by about 40 peoplebill staffers hillary staffers the secret service and the french police security did not allow the american photographers off the bus thus stymieing the scheme of the white house advance team to bathe the clintons bruised partnership in a little paris moonlight after a few confused seconds the clintons climbed back into the car and motored off for a tour of the louvre with the exception ofthe first lady a tidy traveler the presidential operation has the smell of a dormitory about it with everyone crashing for exams each white house reflects the personality of its leader and this president immune to punctuality and discipline will always have a pigpen cloud of chaos around him what you see traveling with the clintons is what you already know he is learning she is searching he is learning to be commander in chief she is searching for a personal style and for a way to blend old rituals with new power at the end of th6 day in normandy bill clinton walked down to the beach with the veterans of omaha beachjoe dawson walt ehlers and robert slaughter the tableau was appealing the young president enjoying the company of the aging heroes but suddenly the presidents aides began tugging the veterans away midconversation so that clinton could walk off at sunset down the beach in his dress shoes and have a preplanned meditative moment with the bluffs on one side and the sea dotted with warships on the other what maureen dowd could not know is that major ship in the background the unitedstatess san jacinto an aegis cruiser was named after george bushs carrier the unitedstatess san jacinto which 50 years ago tonight was launching george bush in the morning pacific time against the mariana islands we have the 50th anniversary of bushs second loss of his airplane and he lost all of his crew his other two crew members coming up the 50th anniversary on september 2 a few months from now maureen closes originally the white house told photographers they were considering a where have all the flowers gone moment where clinton and children would throw flowers into the sea i may barf but they settled on a moment of solitude the president knew he was supposed to look reflective as he had done at the nettuno cemetery the sicilyitaly cemetery south of anzio he knew he was supposed to look reflective for the three cameras and dozen photographers who joined him this soulful moment but after looking soulfully out at the ocean for a moment he seemed at a loss for what to do next according to a photographer on the scene who was scared that clinton was about to mouth the words what do i do now then spying the stones at his feet left by his advance cstaff to show him where his camera marks were the president crouched down and began to arramge the stones into a cross he gathered more stones to finish the cross and then bent his head as though in silent prayer the white house aides were ecstatic these are the prepubescent young aides bumping into one another wasnt it great they asked reportera i will bet one of them said awesome dude"], [0.0009069204097613692, 0.0009069204097613692, 0, "i enjoyed listening to the gentleman from wisconsin and the majority leader make their version of history for all of us to understand but try as they might to trash the 1980e the fact of the matter is every income group improved if we could only get back to the 1980s instead of the malaise of the 1990s is it just democrats that bear the burden of this no democrats ruled the congress but we had republican presidents we had disastrous plans for the 1980s to fix the budget so we all had republicans and democrats our fingers in it together we dont make any claim to the contrary this plan advocated by president clinton is more of the same old warmedover dinner it did not work in the 1980s and it will not work in the 1990s focus for a minute if you will on what the formula has been it is always a promised immediate tax hike followed by a promised future set of spending reductions when was this formula tried we began in 1982 with the first disastrous tax hike up until that point the biggest in history tefra it was called in 1984 we had defra in 1987 we had another effort in 1989 yet another in 1990 the disastrous budget summit agreement that cost george bush his presidency now the democrats led by president clinton come into this chamber and before the united states ask us once again to put blinders on and pretend the emperor is wearing a magnificent suit of clothes in reality it is just the same old failed nonsense we get immediate promised tax hikes now the largest in history and promised future spending reductions of course it turns out when you read the fine print that even in this plan we discover there will be no net spending reductions for the first 2 years of the plan we will never get beyond the first 2 years of the plan that is the idea dont you think it is fascinating we have a 5year plan and we get the first couple of years and then we are onto a new 5year plan with yet more tax increases and further spending reductions look at this chart these numbers have changed a little bit i am going to be very honest this is a moving target and this chart was prepared a month ago so they are a little different let me just outline briefly what the effect of the clinton plan is it is 140 billion in new spending under these numbers 359 billion in new taxes and after we go through all of that what do we end up with after we penalize farmers and bluecollar workers and middleclass workers and everybody in this country shared sacrifice it is like socialism equal sharing of misery as churchill said what do we end up with we end up with an annual budget deficit of 228 5 billion the gentleman from texas the ranking member of the committee on ways and means tells me this is now projected to be 250 billion but it is over 200 billion wherever the numbers may fall what does that do for us it is a serious fiscal risk for this country to end up after the largest tax increase in history and energy tax that is going to cost 600 000 jobs and the effect of the other taxes in the clinton plan may be to cost 1 to 2 million jobs and then we end up with an enormous annual deficit let me show the members by comparison what has happened in the past this chart is not upside down it just so happens that the government has not had a very good record with its budget in past years look this goes clear back to 1940 these are inflationadjusted dollars look at what happened here in world war i in inflationadjusted dollars we had annual budget deficits of over 500 billion but look here near the end of world war ii the tremendous drop that occurred down to about 180 billion guess what folks the next year there was a surplus a surplus that is about 45 billion under this pathetic administration plan after huge tax increases we will end up with an annual budget deficit of over 3200 billion after 5 years and having added a cumulative total to our existing national debt which is about 4 trillion now it will be 5 trillion that will not work it will not work for farmers it will not work for housewives it will not work for children it will not work for senior citizens it will not work for anyone who hopes to thrive in this republic a good democrat john f kennedy used to say a rising tide lifts all boats another way of saying that is when the rich get richer the poor get richer sure we can go back into socialism and have the equal sharing of misery kind of like we got a taste of that right now it is going to get worse if we enact the clinton plan we have had various statements about farmers let me quote from the president of the american farm bureau federation writing to president clinton he said i am compelled to express our members deep concern about the energy tax proposal and your proposed economic package if imposed this tax will stifle economic output increase production costs for farmers cause farm prices to decline and jeopardize our ability to compete in the world markets agricultural products are processed packaged and transported to consumers they will be more costly due to the multiplier effect of energy cost increases at each point in the food distribution chain we ought to get real and recognize the key to balancing this budget freeze it is a reduction in spending when i hear about how many billions that are being cut that is only inside the beltway they are not cutting anything as far as i can tell they are merely reductions below the planned increases but they are net increases it is a disaster we have got to quit talking like that if you are going to talk about a cut tell me that you are spending less next year than you are spending this year that is a cut that is the type of approach we are going to have to take or at least a freeze so we allow the growth in the economy to reduce the deficit paul craig roberts wrote an article saying that if president reagan had continued the partial freeze in spending in 1987 for 2 more years his administration would not have been known for its

chairman over the past few months i have extensively reviewed all of the arguments for and against the north american freetrade agreement i have talked at length with and listened to my constituents to three past presidents to president clinton and to many past and present cabinet officers to both our business community leaders and to our workers and i have listened attentively to our floor debate since the debate on this issue first began over a year ago i have openmindedly waited to hear and to understand any compelling arguments as to why this agreement truly benefits our nation our economy and our nations workers but the more i have heard the less i am convinced that this nafta is good for our nation with its high price tag nafta will cost our taxpayers billions of dollars it will throw our labor markets into turmoil and will cost thousands of american workers their jobs the joint congressional economic committee reported that nafta will cause a potential gross job dislocation of 500 000 or moreand downward pressure on unitedstates wages as well naftas environmental provisions are unwieldy unworkable and have been virtually closed to public participation it will place the health and safety standards of our states at risk because we will simply be unable to effectively enforce them equally important this agreement is not linked to any guarantee that mexican wages will rise as productivity increases in mexico nafta will force american workers to compete with mexican workers who make as little as 6 per day in some mexican export industries productivity is 80 to 90 percent of that in similar united states industries but wages are only 10 to 15 percent of united states wages naftas worker retraining program is not worth the name it proposes to spend the same limited amount of money to retrain hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the entire country as was spent to retrain the workers of only one automotive plant in new york moreover we must consider the threat of increased narcotics traffic crossing the mexican border without question the flow of illicit drugs into this country will increase as our borders are opened as transportation system are streamlined and as border inspections are reduced under nafta this administration was able to find a 17 million customs duties break for the honda motor corp as part of this bill but it could not find any new funding to deal with narcotics traffic that is sure to increase just as it erupted in europe when the european community opened its borders liberalizing trade is an important goal and we should support mexico in its economic reform efforts but in doing so this agreement must not neglect our nations interests and our interests are not well served by an administration which tries to buy a trade agreement at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer with a number of sweetheart deals that amount to protectionism by any other name it is a sorry spectacle when the administration is willing to put us on the road to protectionism in the name of free trade yet this is precisely what is occurring when special protection is promised to our vegetable citrus sugarcane and beet growers the congressional budget office should be required to provide us with the cost to the treasury and to the consumer of these and any other special interest deals designed to win approval for this agreement it is my understanding that this legislation is trying to lower trade barriers at the same time it is laying the cornerstone of several new centers facilities banks and even bridges voters cynicism about washington only worsens as the mexican government and united states corporations pour millions of dollars into the lobbying campaign for this agreement a study conducted last may by the center for public integrity found that mexico was spending at least 30 million to sell this agreement to the united states congress since then millions more dollars have been pumped into this effort according to the center mexico has mounted the most expensive elaborate campaign ever conducted in the united states by a foreign government the mexican government has also helped to finance a private investment fund set up to buy american companies and move their work to mexico amerimex has tried to target some united states manufacturing firms by promising to replace our 10 an hour workers with 1 50 an hour mexican workers if nafta is adopted many american companies are going to have a hard time paying decent wages not to mention complying with environmental and safety standards in a poll conducted last year some 40 percent of 455 executives surveyed indicated they were likely to move some manufacturing to mexico after nafta is passed unlike the situation prevailing in the united states and in canada a governmentdominated alliance of business labor and farm organizations in mexico has broken the traditional tie between a workers wages and his productivity with the result that wages are artificially set and are thereby vrevented from responding to market forces nafta and the labor side agreement do not address this important problem nafta proponents argue that mexican wages have been rising over the past 2 years but these wages are still at about the same level as that prevailing in 1980 at present the average hourly wage in the united states is 16 17 per hour versus 2 35 an hour in mexico president salinas has promised to address this wage and productivity disparity but there are no guarantees that there will be a follow through on his commitment or that any successor mexican administration will choose to honor it in regard to the critical question of job creation there are no commitments about the agreements effects on our labor market only many confusing and contradictory studies the administration bases its claim that nafta will create some 200 000 jobs over the next 2 years based on the shortterm projections of the institute for international economics over a longterm scenario however this same institute projects a net job loss the economic strategy institute estimates that nafta will stimulate foreign investment in mexico especially in its exportoriented industries and that by the year 2002 as many as 220 000 jobs could move south a recent study by the joint economic committee concluded that the trade agreement could produce significant disruptions in the unitedstates labor market and the gross dislocation of 500 000 workers citing the 1993 trade statistics for mexico from the department of commerce the jec study concluded that our trade surplus and the related increase in united states employmentis fast disappearing together with the fact that mexico is likely to devalue its currency in the near futurewith or without a trade agreementthe administration claim of 200 000 new nafta jobs over the next 2 years appears to be completely unrealistic a study completed last month on the impact of the united statescanadian freetrade pact on canadas labor market concluded that the net employment effect has so far been slightly negative the migration of canadian jobs southward to the lower wage and less regulated workplace in our country should be a red flag for the implementation of nafta especially in light of the much greater difference in wages and working conditions prevailing between the united states and its neighbor to the south while many american workers will find their wages being held down or reduced by the agreement the american taxpayer will be asked to contribute billions of dollars for the agreement as well according to the joint economic committee report issued last week the total cost of nafta comes to 20 1 billion over the next 10 years this includes 8 8 billion in lost revenues resulting from tariff reductions 3 9 billion in proposed worker retraining which may be required and income support and 7 4 billion for the cost of the environmental cleanup and infrastructure development other estimates for naftas costs range from 13 billion to 54 billion depending on the estimates for the repair of large scale environmental problems along our border and for the comprehensive retraining and other support for labor force our society could be impacted with other costs as well many experts believe that the increased commercial border traffic resulting from nafta will lead to an increase in the flow of illicit drugs into the united states a september 1993 gao report on drug control efforts along the border indicated that the sheer volume of traffic makes effective interdiction an extremely difficult task about 8 million shipping containers enter the country in a single year and thousands of vehicles cross the bordef from mexico every day the drug problem lies in detecting which of these conveyances are transporting illegal drugs without impeding commerce according to the report an increased flow of commercial traffic under the proposed north american freetrade agreement can only be expected to exacerbate the problem one of the leading experts on the flow of illicit drugs into this country former unitedstates customs commissioner william von raab who served under president reagan has warned that nafta is likely to promote a quantum increase in drug availability here such an increase has taken place in europe when the border barriers were removed while the administration points to increased cooperative efforts of drug enforcement officials on both sides of the border there are no guarantees that mexico will continue its efforts if nafta is approved in advocating this agreement the administration also points to increased mexican cooperation in meeting the environmental pollution problems throughout that country and along the united statesmexican border the key environmental issue in regard to nafta however is the ability of the environmental side agreement to enable individuals or environmental organization to seek redress for any clear pattern of environmental abuses on this count the environmental side agreement is seriously deficient it fails to give these organizations or individuals access to the complaint and adjudication process the process itself is overly long and tortuous the agreement establishes a commission whose main function is the discussion and study of environment problems they are going to try to talk and study the problem to death and when more than talk is required its complicated and lengthy procedures requiring up to 470 days to completewill result in fines only after a countrys repeated failure to enforce its laws the ineffectiveness of the commission was described by top mexican trade negotiator jaime serra puche to the mexican congress on august 19 1993 in his remarks he noted the limited scope of the commissions powers and the timeconsuming process needed to reach enforcement recommendations he concluded that the long timeframe of the process makes itvery improbable that the fines or sanctions could ever be levied by any one of the governments against another in conclusion i believe that this agreement is deficient on too many counts accordingly i call on my colleagues to defeat this agreement before us today and to work with all interested parties in crafting a credible agreement with mexico that will truly improve living standards on both sides of

successful the reauthorization bill this year is straightforward and does not make any major changes to the hmta hazardous materials transportation in this country has never been safer we enjoy a

stringent oversight of the program has helped to achieve that safety record and i am sum that our actions today will serve to continue our enviable record h r 2178 as amended reauthorizes the

bill reported by the public works and transportation committee due to a jurisdictional conflict with the energy and commerce committee i have a commitment that this issue will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted areas"], [0.9876716071739793, 0.012328392826020718, 1, "i from 26 million down to 10 7 million
