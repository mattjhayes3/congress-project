april congress passed a responsible budget that called for spending restraint reduction of the deficit and by slowing the unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers we must continue the policies that grow our economy and keep our tax bills from rising i urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying bill the tax relief extension reconciliation act i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0022326218895614147, 0.0022326218895614147, 0, "i thank the gentleman from georgia who is doing such an extraordinarily wonderful job as he represents the positions that our party holds on so many issues that are important to the american people i am going to be heading to my district for the weekend as most members are spending some time there having the opportunity to talk with them but as the gentleman from georgia was saying we wanted the opportunity to just address and maybe do a little bit of correcting on some of the points that our colleagues from across the aisle have been saying and stating sometimes i think that they are just sadly misinformed on some of these issues they saidthat republicans are not looking to cut spending i just find that extraordinary they said that democrats are the ones that are wanting to cut spending the level of hypocrisy in that statement is absolutely astounding we have a democratic party in this house whose message and i honestly believe many days is the only message that they have that message is spend more whatever it is spend more whatever they are wanting to do if they do not think the outcome is right go spend more and for years they have held this thought that if you just put more money in the pot then the outcome is going to be what they want spend more spend more and what holds them together i think that is something that is a curiosity to many people because they are not united on foreign policy they are not united on winning in iraq they are not united on border control issues they are not united behind working families who tell us repeatedly that what they want is lower taxes lighter regulation preserving individual freedom and having their shot at hope and opportunity our colleagues across the aisle are not united on that the one thing that they repeatedly seem to be united on is spending more of the taxpayers money spending more of your hardearned money and it is amazing to me government never gets enough of the taxpayer money government has this huge voracious appetite for the taxpayers money they just cannot get enough of it there is always another program many of them are great programs but one of the truths that we all see here in this body if government moves in to solve a problem generally neither the private nor notforprofit sector will move in and address that problem 1415 so you have additional costs that come about every time we talk about winning in iraq our friends across the aisle seem to say let us get out regardless of the sacrifices that are made every time we talk about controlling the border they are over there saying no way yesterday i was on a cnbc program and a democrat member of the house said that their party had never been invited to offer spending cuts there are 435 members of this body and they are waiting for an invitation to come in and participate in how to reduce the size of government this morning i was on the floor and i said please consider this the invitation come on everybody needs to work on this it should be a bipartisan effort it should involve every single member of this house how we go about reducing what the federal government spends i have three bills that would enact acrosstheboard cuts 1 percent 2 percent and 5 percent cuts and for all of their talk today about how they want to cut spending not one single democrat is on those bills not one we have got 14 republicans who are on those bills and not one democrat has signed on to commit to finding 1 2 or 5 percent of waste fraud and abuse in government spending i ask my colleagues who is really leading on this issue i hear plenty of accusations from the left i hear plenty of complaining and i see zero action a lot of talk no action they controlled this body for 40 years and in that 40 years they built layer after layer after layer after layer of government they cooked them a big old government cake layer upon layer we have got programs out there that do nothing but waste our money we have got 342 different economic development programs there is a lot of work that we can do everyone is invited to come in and work on these issues and anytime we even try to restrain spending look at the rhetoric that we hear it is our party in this house it is our leader the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert who truly is leading on this issue not the minority leader it is our leaders who are pushing this it is our party who would like to reduce government spending by billions of ddllars billions more in next years budget it is our party that would like to see acrosstheboard spending reductions their solution that they offer is repealingtax relief that is well deserved by hardworking american families repealing that reliefand raising taxes period that is the only thing that unites their party i hope that they

help you to keep from spending again what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is

take into account all of the costs associated with each individual facility impacted by such a plan clearly there are benefits to the consolidation and realignment of postal operations but i rise today to ask the chairman and the ranking member and the gentleman from illinois for their support in working with the postal service to make sure that all impacts are taken into account not just those that are fiscal in nature it is critical that congress understands the closing of a postal facility has a very great impact on its local community"]]}
