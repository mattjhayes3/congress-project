on the budget for giving us this opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who

community cut 4 7 million native american head start cut 3 8 million child abuse 2 2 million abandoned infants assistance 1 3 million i can only say oppose this majority leadership budget realize that our children are our best investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and affording prescriptions for seniors the majoritys budget proposal leaves the medicare trust fund in a precarious position and its future in question the congressional budget

the social security trust fund congress and the president have come upon the historic opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay for more government spending with that i yield to the gentleman from arizona who serves

fundamental question and that is is it right is it fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to

surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the centerpiece of this

contributions to president clintons 1996 reelection campaign and how the clinton administration either intentionally or through incompetence has irreparably damaged and compromised the security of every man woman and child in the united states last summer during president clintons trip to china jiang zemin the president of china told him that he had no involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states and president clinton took his word for it in that july 2 1998 press conference president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that giving illegal campaign contributions to the democratic national committee or the presidents reelection committee why would president clinton say that mr speaker the new york times reported in may that johnny chung was given 300 000 by ms liu chaoying a chinese aerospace executive who is a lieutenant colonel in the peoples liberation army in communist army and her father at one time was the head of the chinese peoples liberation army in april of 1996 27 months before president clintons meeting with president jiang of china sandy berger the head of the national security council was briefed that china had stolen w88 nuclear warhead designs neutron bomb data and that a spy might still be passing secrets to china at los alamos one of our nuclear research facilities now the w88 nuclear warhead design is a miniaturized nuclear warhead and you can put as many as 10 of them on one missile so you can hit 10 cities with one missile launched from china thereby endangering as many as 50 or 60 million americans and the neutron bomb data that kind of information would allow an enemy of the united states communist china to launch a missile at the united states with a neutron bomb warhead and when it explodes kills everybodyin the city but it does not destroy the infrastructure the roads the bridges or the buildings now sandy berger the head of the nsc would have had to have told the president about this why would president clinton say thatc lie beieved president jiang of china on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when communist chinas prime minister zhu rongji was here hp was asked about chinas theft of unitedstates nuclear secrets and prime minister zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i do not believe such story and president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this country and in this government that i do not know anything about and he was indicating that the stealing of this technology and the illegal campaign contributions thatwere authorized by the leaders of the communist chinese government could have happened without their knowledge if that happens in communist china they either shoot them or put them in prison so it is disingenuous for the president to say that he believed him when he knew full well that this was taking place in july of 1997 a year before his meeting with president jiang and 27 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu the administration acknowledges that nsc director sandy berger briefed the president told him about weaknesses in our nuclear laboratories and about chinas spying so when president clinton met with president jiang and prime minister zhu he had already been briefed by nsc director berger sometime before about the possibility of spying and espionage taking place at our nuclear facilities before the president met with zhu the l a times reported that johnny chung had testified under oath that he was directed to make illegal campaign contributions to the presidents reelection campaign by general ji shengde who met with him three times and ordered that 300 000 be directed to chung for political contributions and that there were other conduits other people that they were working with to get money into the presidents reelection campaign and to the democratic national committee now johnny chung was a friend of the president he was in the white house 50 times he brought other people in communist leaders to meet with the president and he was one of the major conduits of bringing illegal campaign contributions into this country general ji shengde was the head of the chinese communist military intelligence the equivalent of our defense intelligence agency in this country and he was the one that was giving the order to funnel these illegal campaign contributions from communist china into the presidents reelection campaign and into the democrat national committee now why would president clinton suggest that maybe the chinese leadership did not know about the spying at los alamos why would he say that when they do something in china as i said before they either shoot them or throw them in jail now regarding chinese espionage in april of 1996 27 months before president clinton accepted president jiangs denial and 3 years before he suggested that chinas spying might be the fault of big government the department of energys chief of intelligence notra trulock told national security advisor sandy berger the head of the nsc that china had stolen both w88 nuclear warhead designs that is the miniature nuclear warhead that they can put 10 of them on one missile and neutron bomb data that a spy might still be passing those secrets to china from los alamos our nuclear research facility according to energy officials who took part in the meeting and read highly classified materials used to prepare for it sandy berger was also told how the stolen technology could fit int o beijings overall nuclear strategy and how the w88 technology could be used as part of a plan to rely on the mobility of trucklaunched missiles with small warheads to better survive a counternuclear attack by the united states according to the new york times energy officials said the briefing was a culmination of a 5month interagency study of the w88 theft and related issues and it was pretty was a pretty specific briefing one american official who was present said that sandy berger was even told that investigators had identified a prime suspect at los alamos in the theft and would shortly turn their information over to the fbi for a formal criminal inquiry why did sandy berger the head of the nsc appearing on nbcs meet the press last month say the information he was told about 3 years ago was very general and very preliminary why did he say we did not have a suspect in the theft of the w88 technology why did he say that we did not know who we did not really know how and we did not really know what we know at the end of the briefing that i just talked about according to officials that were present notra trulock referred to a report from a chinese source which had been provided to the department of energy by the fbi in march of 1996 over 3 years ago the chinese source indicated that officials inside chinas intelligence service were boasting about how they had just stolen secrets from the uwnited states and had used themto improve beijings neutron bomb the source further suggested that chinese agents solved a 1988 design problem by coming back to the united states in 1995 to steal more secrets the source who in the past has drovided reliable inforirao o ever detailed how the information was transferred from the united states to communist china according to one official the intelligence about the neutron bomb was hot off the press and it was included in the briefing to warn the white house of the possibility of continuing chinese espionage in november of 1996 almost 1 years after first suspecting the theft of nuclear secret from los alamos charles b curtis the deputy secretary for energy ordered a series of security measures to be carried out on a straight timetable during the next several months none of these measures were carried out until september of 1998 almost 2 years later and there was a threat and a strong indication that espionage had taken place and our top secrets were being stolen by the communist chinese why did we wait 2 years why did they not implement those series of security measures in march of 1997 4 months before president clinton was scheduled to visit china the energy departments acting secretary for defense programs victor reis and the acting director for nonproliferation kenneth baker prevented notra trulock when he saw further evidence that the chinese had other ongoing spy operations at the weapons lab and he asked to meet with secretary of energy federico pefia they kept him from briefing secretary pefia for 4 months why in april of 1997 when the fbi requested a wiretap to be put on the phone of the conversations of wen ho lee the chief suspect in the theft of americas w88 miniaturized warhead technology the nuclear technology they were turned down by the justice department why would the justice department turn down this request for electronic technology to be put on this gentlemans phone when they thought and highly suspected and even knew that he was giving top secret nuclear technology to the chinese communists that endangered every man woman and child in this country why would the justice department not allow electronic technology and wiretaps to be put on his phone why and who at the justice department turned down this request this guy was accused of stealing americas most advanced nuclear technology why was this request turned down why in august of 1997 fbi director louis freeh told energy department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence to arrest wen ho lee but that mr lee could now be removed from his position without harming their investigation and that doe was to determine whether or not to keep lee on since the case was not as important as what damage he might do or continue to do by accessing additional information why did the department of energy keep lee on with fbi approval retaining his security clearances until december of 1998 about 2 years later when he was moved to a nonclassified area and took a lie detector test for the first time why again in 1997 in july a year before his meeting with president jiang and 21 months before his meeting with prime minister zhu sandy berger the head of the nsc received a second detailed briefing about chinas spying and soon after told president clinton about weaknesses at the laboratories and about chinas spying in august of 1997 gary samore the senior national security council official assigned to the china spy case asked now get this asked the cia director to seek an alternative analysis on how china developed its smaller warheads in other words he did not want to talk about them being stolen from los alamos through espionage he wanted to find out an alternative analysis from the cia on how they might have gotten this technology immediately after he gotthis briefing from notra trulock in august of 1997 why when presented with such overwhelming evidence of chinese espionage did gary samore at the national security council seek to downplay the significance of the information asking the cia to come up with another explanation about chinas advances why in may of 1998 notra trulock energy departments director of intelligence was demoted to acting deputy director of intelligence after he made a third report to the energy department inspector general about a steady pattern of suppression of counterintelligence issues somebody was trying to keep a lid on all this mr speaker in july 1998 the same month that president clinton was meeting with chinas president jiang when the house intelligence committee requested an update on the spy case from notra trulock trulock testified that acting energy secretary elizabeth moler ordered him not to go to the panel for fear that the information would be used to attack president clintons china policy why did elizabeth moler do this the chinese thefts of unitedstates nuclear secrets according to paul redmund the cias chief spy hunter were quote far more damaging to national security than aldrich ameshe is the spy who is now in jailand the spying would turn out to be as bad as the rosenbergs now you recall the rosenbergs were the ones who gave nuclear secrets to the russians and the soviet union back during and after world war 11 both of them were executed for giving that nuclear technology to the soviets so that they could build their nuclear missiles that were directed at the united states and he said this mr redmund that this spying would turn out to be as bad or worse or as bad as the rosenberg case you can see how really bad this is at the same time that china was conducting its highly successful espionage operations against the united states the committee on government reform which i chair for 2 years has known about and tracked millions of dollars that were given to the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee that can be directly traced to hong kong macao indonesia south america and communist china long before president clinton met with president jiang and long before he met with prime minister zhu we knew for a long time that chinas head of military intelligence general ji shengde had been pulling the strings for a massive conglomerate called china resources which unitedstates intelligence agencies have said operates fronts for the peoples liberation army in hong kong and worldwide for a long time we have known that china resources has joint ventures with the indonesiabased international firm called the lippo group we have also known that the lippo group is run by mochtar and james riady we have known that the ethnic chinese james riady is a close friend of the presidents and has frequently visited him at the white house he was also instrumental in getting john huang appointed to a very important position at the commerce department and later at the democrat national committee we have known that james riadys chief adviser on political donations was john huang who is a former employee of the lippo group and who accepted this job at the commerce department and then left the commerce department to work at the democrat national committee where with the help of james riady and the lippo group and mochtar he collected nearly 3 million in illegal campaign contributions for the democrat party and the presidents reelection committee we have in our possession checks copies of checks which represent illegal contributions to the democrat party drawn from accounts in the lippo bank which is controlled by the riady family it is now being reported that johnny chung who gave more than 360 000 to the democrat party has told a grand jury that some of the money he contributed to the democrat party came from chinas head of military intelligence the very same people that wanted this nuclear technology general ji shengde general ji is the man in the chinese military most likely to be directing chinas spy operations and most likely to be interested in americas nuclear secrets it now appears that general ji was the mastermind behind chinas efforts to get the clintongore team reelected johnny chung has reportedly told a grand jury he was coordinating efforts to funnel money into the campaign along with others according to general ji is it possible that he was working with john huang and charlie trie as well johnny chung john huang and charlie trie together raised over 3 million in illegal donations that we know of that have been linked to the bank of china it is important to repeat that on july 2 1998 during president clintons trip to china when he was asked to comment on his discussions with president jiang zemin about chinas involvement in campaign fundraising in the united states president clinton said they looked into that and he was obviously certain and i do believe him that he had not ordered or authorized or approved such a thing the illegal contributions and that he could find no evidence that anybody in governmental authority had done that the president said he believed that president clinton at his own press conference on march 19 1998 in response to the question can you assure us the american people that under your watch no valuable secrets were lost and he said quote can i tell you there has been no espionage at the lab since i have been president i can tell you that no one has reported to me they suspect such a thing has occurred on april 8 1999 at a joint press conference with president clinton when chinas prime minister zhu rongji was asked about chinas theft of nuclear secrets zhu said i have no knowledge whatsoever of any charge of any allegation of espionage or the theft of nuclear technology and i dont believe such a story this is the prime minister of china president clinton responded china is a big country with a big government and i can only say that america is a big country with a big government and occasionally things happen in this government that i do not know anything about how could president clinton who knew at least 1 year before meeting with president jiang and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying and had all this information about illegal chinese efforts to funnel money into the 1996 clintongore reelection efforts say i do believe president jiang it is just almost disingenuous it is inconceivable that president clinton did not know about chinas espionage and chinas funneling of illegal contributions into this reelection campaign when he met with prime minister zhu how could the president who had been briefed by sandy berger in july of 1997 and probably as early as april of 1996 about chinese spying suggest that maybe chinas spying was the result of big government and that maybe chinas leadership did not know about their spying at los alamos wen ho lee we know had not only been involved in that spying at least that is what we believe now and he has already taken some lie detector tests and is still under investigation we also know that he called convicted spy peter lee at the livermore laboratories where a neutron bomb was being researched some time ago how could the president say that this was a result of big government it is impossible that the chinese leadership did not know about this spying you get shot in china when you do something like that without telling the leadership on march 7 1997 president clinton said i dont believe you can find any evidence of the fact that i had changed government policy solely because of a contribution in february of 1998 5 months before he met president jiang and 14 months before he met prime minister zhu president clinton ignored strenuous objections from the department of justice which was investigating the loral corporation for an unauthorized technology transfer to china and granted loral a waiver for official transfers of essentially the same missile technology to china that loral was being criminally investigated for giving to china without authorization in 1996 bernard schwartz the chairman of loral corporation contributed over 1 365 million to various democratic accounts including the reelection of the president in a march interview with cnns wolf blitzer when questioned about chinas spying at los alamos vice president gore said the law enforcement agencies pursued it aggressively with our full support on march 14 1999 sandy berger asserted that upon learning of chinas nuclear espionage the administration quote imposed and enforced the strictest controls on china of any country except those for which we have embargoes such as libya end quote if the vice president and nsc director sandy berger are right why after showing deceptive answers in his first lie detector test in december of 1998 did it take the clinton administration another 2 months to give mr lee a second test after failing that second test why did it take them another month to get rid of him why did elizabeth moler who ordered notra trulock not to brief the house intelligence committee say that she could not recall being told about trulocks request for a briefing even when a memorandum from mr trulock concerning the briefing request was found in the safe in her office after she left her job at the energy department if what the vice president and sandy berger say is true why within 2 months after becoming energy secretary in january of 1993 when keith fultz assistant comptroller general with the general accounting office briefed hazel oleary and strongly recommended that the department of energy improve controls over foreign visitors to doe weapons laboratories and urged oleary to seek a further briefing about espionage at doe laboratories from unitedstates intelligence agencies did fultz say that oleary say she did not seem very interested in the matter why according to the washington times did a former contractor for one of the department of energys three nuclear weapons laboratories recall that oleary quote decided in her infinite wisdom to lessen security at the labs nuclear technology is being stolen and she lessened security at the labs the cold war is over the contractor says that she indicated and in mrs olearys mind it was not necessary to have so much money spent on security we did away with the people in actual security guard forces security clearances were deemed virtually unnecessary in all but a very few areas former secure areas were opened up and many documents and files were allowed to be seen which at one time were of a secret or classified nature why according to the washington times did the white house originally tell the cox committee that the president was not told about chinese espionage until 1998 we know he must have knownback as far as 1997 or 1996 when his nsc director sandy berger found out about it why did david leavy spokesman for the national security council explain this discrepancy by saying well after the cox committee process weve remembered more on april 7 1998 speaking at a unitedstates institute for peace event president clinton implied that anyone critical of china was using quote caricatures and exaggerating the chinese threat let me share a portion of the presidents speech according to the record now we hear that china is a country to be feared a growing number of people say that it is the next great threat to our security and our wellbeing they claim it is building up its military machine for aggression and using the profits of our trade to pay for it they urge us therefore to contain china to deny it access to our markets our technology our investment and to bolster the strength of our allies in asia to counter the threat a strong china will pose in the 21st century what about that scenario clearly if it chooses to do so china could pursue such a course pouring much more of its wealth into military might and into traditional great power geopolitics this would rob it of much of its future prosperity and it is far from inevitable that china will choose this path therefore i would argue that we should not make it more likely that china choose this path by acting as if that decision has already been made we have to follow a different course we cannot afford caricatures well the president knew that they had been stealing nuclear secrets from our laboratories our nuclear laboratories neutron bomb technology w88 technology mrving technology for warheads and it had been given to them by a person who worked for the laboratory the president had to know this as far back as early 1997 and yet they kept the man on there for over 2 more years and the president said we do not need to worry about that why is china taking this additional nuclear technology if they do not really need it if they do not have any intentions of using it just a couple of years ago they fired some missiles into the sea of china next to taiwan one of the leading military people in china said that he did not think the united states would worry too much about that because if we got involved we would be much more concerned about los angeles than we would about taiwan the implication was that there might be a threat that they would do something like launching a missile at los angeles if we stuck our nose into the taiwanese issue on march 29 1999 one week before president clintons press conference with chinese prime minister zhu newsweek reported that when the cia recently showed data obtained from its sources on china to a team of nuclear weapons experts they practically fainted these are our nuclear weapons experts and when the cia recently showed that data that was obtained from its sources about chinas stealing of that technology our nuclear weapons guys almost fainted the data much of it written in chinese and never read had been stored in cia computers and forgotten until now it showed that chinese scientists were routinely using phrases descriptions and concepts that came straight out of unitedstates weapons laboratories like los alamos the chinese penetration is total said one official close to the investigation they are deep deep into the labs black programs and black programs are our most sensitive nuclear technology security issues and they are deep deep into them according to our experts newsweek even reported that china may have even recently acquired two unitedstates cruise missiles that failed to detonate during last falls unitedstates attack on terrorist osama bin laden and may be attempting to copy their sophisticated guidance and avoidance avionics technology how can the president say that anyone who is critical of china and the threat are using caricatures over the last 2 years my committee has been conducting an investigation into illegal fundraising including illegal efforts by the chinese to influence our elections we have had 121

china when my staff attempted to travel to china to interview some of these people the chinese government denied us visas and said they would arrest anybody we sent over there to investigate this we asked the bank of china to provide us with bank records that would show the origins of millions of dollars in foreign money that was funneled into the presidents reelection committee and the democrat national committee the bank of china has turned us down flat the clinton administration has refused to do anything to help us get this important information when so many people take the fifth amendment or flee the country it is obvious that a lot of laws have been broken the clinton administration failure to investigate chinas funneling of illegal contributions into the clintongore reelection campaign and chinas theft of americas most advanced nuclear secrets are absolute tragedies either intentionally or through its own incompetence the clinton administration has caused irreparable damage to americas national security it has compromised the security of every man woman and child in this country this has to be investigated the american public has a right to know what is going on regarding these illegal campaign contributions and the thefts of our nuclear technology and whether or not there is any connection between the two we can no longer accept the compromise of this nations national security and we intend to pursue it as hard as we possibly can but we need the help of the justice department which has been stonewalling us and we need the administration to

billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of

july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in

nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export factories and western investors which of these three want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the

motion to recommit with or without instructions passage of this rule will allow the house of representatives to consider important bipartisan legislation to repeal a misguided tax on social security benefits for most of the programs existence social security has been exempt from federal income tax but in 1993 as part of the largest tax increase in american history president clinton and vice president gore proposed a tax increase on social security benefits they claimed this tax would reduce the federal budget deficit at which time it was 255 billion the controversial clintongore proposal was vigorously debated in this house of representatives opponents of the plan argued that control of federal spending not tax increases was a better way to reduce the budget deficit at the end of the debate the clintongore proposal was passed by a single vote in the democratcontrolled house not one republican voted for this proposal in the senate vice president gore cast the deciding vote enabling president clinton to sign this tax increase on senior citizens into law despite passage of the clintongore tax increase budget deficits continued and the money collected from the social security tax increase funded even more government spending with deficits increasing in 1994 the republican party became the majority party for the house and the senate for the first time in 50 years the republican congress enacted muchneeded tax relief controlled government spending and passed the first balanced budget in a generation tax cuts and fiscal responsibility along with the hard work of the american people have caused the federal budget to become balanced faster than was forecast this year the federal budget has a surplus of 233 billion even proponents of the 1993 social security tax increase should agree it is now time to repeal this tax on senior citizens proponents said it was necessary to cut the deficit and now the deficit is gone this social security tax is more than unnecessary it is bad and unwise tax policy it penalizes seniors who work and discourages americans from saving the tax is also unfair it changes tax policy in the middle of the game penalizing recipients who based past work and saving decisions on old law in essence this tax on social security benefits tells americans not to save because if they do they will have their benefits of social security taxed i am troubled that our national savings rate is at an alltime low in fact private savings are actually a net negative at this time it is clear to me that as long as we have a taxon social security and one that does not encourage savings and investment we are going to have a problem with the national savings rate opponents will argue that this tax is for the rich this is simply not the case this tax affects seniors who make more than 25 000 if they are single or 32 000 if they are married that is not exactly the rich of america it is called the middle class of america furthermore these income levels are not indexed for inflation meaning more and more lowerincome people will be impacted by this tax every year according to the congressional budget office 10 million beneficiaries are hit by this tax this year and more than 17 5 million beneficiaries will be hit in 2010 the average tax this year is 1 180 it will grow to 1 359 in the year opponents will also argue that repealing the clintongore tax increase on social security benefits will weaken medicare this is also not the case the legislation requires that funds from general revenue will be transferred to offset to the penny the amount being generated by the social security tax thus maintaining medicares current financing with passage of this underlying legislation congress says that social security recipients should not be penalized for retirement and savings through an ira or a 401 k plan or for taking a parttime job after retiring the gentleman from texas chairman archer from the committee on ways and means aptly stated to us in the committee on rules yesterday when he sought this rule the only people that pay this tax are those who saved during their lifetimes or those who will be working clearly this is

a great hearing in minnesota today it really builds on what we have learned i think today was the 21st state that we have gone to the 23rd field hearing that we have gone to people at the local and at the state level we have asked them what is working in education and then really and we should maybe do this in future hearings to give us a grade as to how washington is either helping them or assisting them in getting them and enabling them to get done what they want to get done at the local level i think one of the witnesses that we had today i do not remember exactly which one it was maybe the gentleman from colorado does who said when one takes a look at the system that we have created here in washington of hundreds of different programs hundreds of different mandates and the number that we have heard today was we get 6 percent of the money from washington we get 70 percent of the rules and the regulations that is not outlandish i mean consistently when we go from one state to the next ohio they have documented it they said we get 7 percent of our money from washington we get 50 percent of the mandates 50 percent of the paperwork so that is consistent from all the states that we have talked to but one of the people said only you in washington could come up with a system that looks like this if you are actually focused on kids if you were focused on results which is kids learning you would have a very different set of programs and requirements only a system that is focused on process you know that this is what we want to have happen and this funding stream and a system that measures process rather than kids learning is what we have created here in washington again we heard it in minnesota today we have heard it at every single state that we have gone to that is the formula for kids learning parental involvement number one that is the key a focus on basic academics again we have got a charter school today talking traditional public schools talking about a focus on basic academics you have to provide a safe and a drugfree school you cannot have learning go on where kids are concerned about their safety or they are concerned about what their colleagues or their peers are doing in the classroom or in the hallways you have to focus on getting dollars into the classroom that consistently is the formula the gentleman from wiscqnsin is talking about we have got this program we have got that program what have we learned we learned that when one has got hundreds of education programs one has got streams of paperwork of bureaucracy that every time wisconsin michigan or minnesota sends dollars to washington for education they have got to come back to us begging to get some of their money back we then give it to them we give it to them with a whole string of mandates so they end up spending it on things they do not necessarily believe are their priorities instead of getting a dollar back for every dollar that they send here when one calculates all the paperwork all of the bureaucracy all these types of things we believe that at most they get 60 cents back maybe sometime later as we go through the process there are some other things that we can talk about we can talk about exactly how effective the bureaucracy is here in washington this is a department that now for 2 years in a row has failed its audit meaning that it cannot come back to congress it cannot come back to the american people the people that fund this agency and say we have been very careful in managing your money and we can tell you exactly where it goes we know for 2 years they failed their audit we know that for at least 3 more years they will not be able to get a clean audit we all know that in that kind of environment there have been a number of opportunities for waste fraud and abuse we can maybe outline what some of those are later on as we go through this process then we can also talk about what some of our priorities are for addressing this issue my colleagues have already mentioned one which is let us fully fund and meet the commitments that we have made to local school districts by increasing and meeting our commitment on idea we can talk about eliminating bureaucracy and red tape through the edflex program giving school districts more flexibility through the state the straight as program where we give them the money and say you decide whether you want to hire teachers train teachers reduce class size or whatever and also we want to focus on getting 95 cents of every federal education dollar into the

back home want us to work together and find solutions to the challenges that we are facing i am proud to say that over the last 41 2 years we have listened and we have responded to those concerns to work to change how washington works to make washington more responsive to the folks back home i am proud to say that we accomplished some things we were told we could not do we were told we could not balance the budget we were told we could not balance the budget and lower taxes we were told we could never reform our welfare system but we did i am proud to say in the last 4 years t jiat we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years producing a projected 2 8 trillion surplus of extra tax revenues we lowered taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years and 3 million illinois children now qualify for the 500 per child tax credit back home in my state of illinois that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming here to washington we also reformed our welfare system which was failing beyond imagination we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation as a result of our welfare reform we have seen the welfare rolls in illinois cut in half we have balanced the budget we lowered taxes for the middle class we reformed our welfare system that is pretty good folks often say those are real accomplishments but what is next on congress agenda we are working to continue responding to the issues and concerns of the folks back home and we have a simple agenda in this congress the republican agenda is simple good schools low taxes and a secure retirement for all america and our budget that were working on today reflects that i am often asked some questions in town meetings back home one of the most important ones we addressed this year i am often asked by folks whether at a senior citizens center a union hall or a vfw when are the politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund that is a pretty important basic question of course washington has raided the social security trust fund for over 30 years back when lbj was president washington began that process and bad habits are hard to break i am proud to say this republican congress is going to lock away 100 percent of social security revenues for social security only let me point out here what this means and i will compare the republican budget with the clintongore budget on social security the republican budget of course locks away 100 percent of social security for social security i would point out that 137 billion of the social security surplus under our lockbox will stay in social security now the president talks about 62 percent of the surplus for social security and what the president and vice president gore are talking about doing is spending 38 percent of social security on othei things that is what the folks back home call raiding the social security trust fund republicans say 100 percent of social security for social security clintongore they say 62 percent and spend the rest on other things we want to put a stop to that and that is why the lockbox proposal republicans are moving through the congress is so important because it is the first step we should take as we work to save social security let us lock away social security first before we consider any other reforms another question i am often asked is no one ever talks about the national debt let me point out that in this budget this year we are in a position where we are going to be able to pay down 1 8 trillion of the national debt last year we paid off 50 billion this year we are projected to pay off 100 billion of the national debt and under our budget we propose the potential of paying down 1 8 trillion of the national debt saving social security paying down the debt i am also asked at the union halls and the vfws and the other community centers and the grain elevators in the district that i represent when are we going to do something about the tax burden on families today the average family in illinois sends 40 percent of their income to washington and springfield and the local courthouse in taxes the tax burden today for the middle class is at its highest level ever in peacetime history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product goes to washington that is the highest level ever in peacetime history and it is putting a tremendous squeeze on middle class families i believe as we work to lower the tax burden on middle class families we should simplify the tax code we should work to bring fairness to the tax code beginning with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty it is simply wrong that under our tax code 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married let us lower taxes by simplifying the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty let us pay down the national debt and let us save social security"],

i listen to the concerns back home i hear several things the folks back home in llinois tell me they want low taxes and good schools and they want a secure retirement and that is the republican agenda this year we want to ensure that our local public schools and private schools are strong and that our public schools are run by locally elected school boards and local teachers and local parents and local school administrators and that dollars we provide actually reach the classroom to help kids learn we also want to save social security by walling off the social security trust fund and ensuring that 100 percent of social security dollars go for social security and we want to lower taxes now that also means we have some big challenges ahead of us how are we going to accomplish that there is a big challenge and an opportunity and my colleagues and i have participated just in the last hour talking about some of those challenges but the biggest opportunity and challenge is what are we going to do with the socalled surplus 2 8 trillion in extra tax revenue most of which is social security well the president says we should take 62 percent of it for social security and spend the rest republicans say we want to do it differently we want to ensure that 100 percent of social security dollars go for social security and what is left over the incomes tax revenue surplus we want to use to lower the tax burden on working families and pay down the national debt that is a big challenge our goal this year is to do something that has not been done for a generation we are going to stop a practice that began with president johnson back in the 1960s when he was looking for a way to finance the vietnam war and to finance the great society programs and grow government president johnson and the congress in the late 1960s began the practice of raiding the social security trust fund our number one goal this year as we work to save social security is to put a stop to that to stop the raids on social security let me point out something here this coming year there will be about 137 billion in surplus social security revenues republicans say let us give 100 percent of that to social security the president because he only wants to take 62 percent of the surplus wants to spend a big portion of the social security trust fund in fact he wants to spend about 52 billion of the social security trust fund revenues this coming year over 5 years that is 250 billion raided from the social security trust fund we want to put a stop to that while we put a stop to the raid on the social security trust fund we also want to pay down the national debt and with money that is left over after we protect the social security trust fund dollars when it comes to those income tax revenues the extra tax revenue that comes from the income tax the real surplus beyond social security we want to use that to give back to the people who sent it here some ask well how will we lower the tax burden taxes are at their highest level in history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product today goes to the federal government the average illinois family sends 40 percent of their income to local state and federal government clearly that tax burden is too high well i suggest as we look for ways of lowering the tax burden on working middle class families that we work to simplify the tax code to address the fairness issues in the tax codes when i am back home whether at a union hall or the vfw clearly they identify the need to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the need to eliminate the death tax and to eliminate the earnings limit we can save social security let us wall off the social security trust fund and bring fairness to the tax code"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9971844553947449,

regardless of party label he won folks over with his heart and his ability to be just like everyone else to connect with his fellow man without pretense if another mayor had turned down a state dinner at the white house because of his wifes bowling engagement it would have been a serious breach of etiquette to ralph perk and the city of cleveland it is a badge of honor mayor perk served as mayor from 1972 to 1977 at a time when the city was developing some financial difficulties but ralph perk was able to work with the federal government and the nixon white house to secure funding to alleviate a number of those difficulties he is credited with establishing a regional sewer district and he is also credited with paying off the bonds using city funds to pay off the bonds of the financially strapped cleveland transit authority to create what is now the greater cleveland regional transit authority although it has been more than 20 years since ralph perk served as the mayor of our fair city he has never been nor will he ever be forgotten he was a true cleveland original a man who loved his hometown with all of his heart and served it with great spirit and dedication he will

and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am

have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled

collect sales taxes on commercial internet transactions instead i will be supporting the istook amendment which will limit this new moratorium to two years the growth of ecommerce has presented policy makers with a host of complex new issues over the last few years one of the largest challenges however is not a new issue but an ageold problemtaxation some argue that online retail transactions should remain exempt from tax collections due to problems with defining pointsofsale in the cyber marketplace additionally opponents of taxing internet sales argue that requiring taxation will stifle growth creativity and innovation in this new industry on the other hand state and local officials view the intemet as a tide that will erode local and regional tax bases with devastating consequences to traditional brickandmortar retailers as well as critical state and local government functions to come to grips with this problem and these competing pointsofview in 1998 congress passed the internet tax freedom act that prohibited any new state local or federal taxes on electronic commerce until october 2001 in addition it created a 19member advisory commission on electronic commerce to study the intemet taxation issue and report its recommendations to congress the advisory commission issued no recommendations because of a lack of consensus on this issue but despite this fact congress is set today to vote on a bill that would extend the current moratorium for an additional five years even though the current moratorium does not expire until october 1 2001a full 17 months from now congress should take this 17 month opportunity to hold public hearings on this issue rather than rushing to the floor a contentious and politically motivated bill that pits traditional business against ebusiness while almost everyone agrees that there should be no new taxes or fees on internet services or access there is little consensus on allowing state and local governments to collect sales taxes on remote electronic commerce transactions the distinction between these two forms of taxation is subtle but critical taxing internet services and access would surely stifle the growth and innovation of this emerging industry taxing remote sales transactions however will not restrict this growth rather it will ensure that all business entitieswhether located on main street or cyber streetwill be able to equitably and fairly compete moreover allowing state and local govemments to collect sales taxes on remote transactions will ensure that critical state and local services such as education and public safety will continue to be adequately funded and controlled at the state and local level where they belong this is why 34 of our nations governors republican and democrat including governor bill graves of kansas oppose extending this moratorium as well almost every municipal and county government in my district has passed resolutions opposing legislation like h r 3709 that erode their taxing authority i have included one such resolution for the record i am supporting the istook amendment that provides a two year extension of the moratorium because i believe that congress our states and our municipalities need time to develop a fair simple and equitable system that is guided by the following principles fairness any solution should apply not only to internet transactions but to all remote transactions so as not to unfairly discriminate against ecommerce transactions but we must also recognize that not taxing remote transactions including ecommerce unfairly discriminates against traditional facetoface transactions simplicity the solution should not be difficult for the digital economy to apply or for local and state governments to administer limited scope sales should be taxed in order to provide a level of fairness to traditional brickandmortar businesses but the use of the internet itself should not in other words congress should not tax data transmission network services or anything else that would amount to a tax on the medium itself the advent of ecommerce should not be viewed as either a threat or potential windfall for state and local governments assessing taxes on internet sales should all else being equal have no effect on state and local tax revenue what is lost as a result of decreasing facetoface sales should be offset by gains from increasing online sales indeed as a matter of fairness and fiscal responsibility remote sales should not be beyond the scope of state and local tax jurisdictions further those state and local jurisdictions should not have to cede their independent authority to a federally mandated flat sales tax system the ultimate solution should use the same tools that enable ecommerce to construct an easytouse mechanism for businesses consumers and governments alike to operate in the digital economy a software based solution that is able to identify and levy the appropriate level of

arkansas however i have been tremendously disappointed with the leadership shown or lack of leadership shown by the unitedstates department of agriculture during the entire process that has led up to the publishing of the tmdl rule the total maximum daily load during the entire process there has been much much to be faulted there are serious questions about the science and financial analysis underlying these new water quality regulations proposed by epa recent reports by the general accounting office the society of american foresters and other respected experts have questioned the wisdom of epas proposed rules our colleagues on the committee on transportation and infrastructure have called on the epa to withdraw this rule as have a number of agricultural and environmental groups even usda in their own testimony before the committee on appropriations took strong exception to some of what epa proposed in their tmdl rule although they seem to have tempered that concern somewhat this house has already spoken on this issue with a provision passed by the house in the vahud appropriation bill that does not allow epa to implement the proposed rule in fy now usda has the technical and scientific expertise to review the actions of epa and help guide them toward a reasonable solution that might actually work in the field and that is why the gentleman from arkansas offers this amendment today and why it is very pertinent to the discussion today if the department of agriculture is not willing to use their resources to stand up to epa for the benefit of farmers and ranchers and the environment then we should spend their money helping those same landowners that are already trying to preserve their soil and protect water quality that is the simplistics of this amendment now i find it very frustrating because i happen to have been chairman of the subcommittee on department operations oversight nutrition and forestry when we reorganized usda in 1992 and one of the things we agreed to in this congress and with the administration was that we wanted to improve the ability of usda to be a coequal with other branches of government when it comes to dealing with environmental and food safety issues the problem is that we do not have a coequal when one part of the coequal does not stand up for that which is in their own testimony and also in which they have said we agree so the purpose of this amendment today is pretty simple it is delivering what we hope will be a very strong message to both epa and to usda that common sense must apply and to all of those groups that keep pounding on epa to do things that do not make common sense to require our farmers and ranchers to spend unlimited amounts of money fixing a problem that may not be fixable with any amount of money if we could just come back just come back to a common sense approach in which we recognize that farmers and ranchers want to solve the tmdl problem i certainly in my district have some very serious problems in which all farmers and ranchers are willing to work with reasonable people to come up with a reasonable solution that will solve the problem therefore i am not here today saying we should do nothing but many times doing something is very very detrimental to the very cause in which we are talking and today it is clean water when there is someone within a bureaucracy that so believes they are right that they are completely completely willing to ignore all common sense and forge ahead with requiring paperwork burdens and things that absolutely will not solve the problem in the opinion of everybody but them there is a problem so this amendment is very serious let us put the money where there is an indication that we will have a willingness to solve the problem hopefully though we will have the kind of common sense approach to this question that will lead us to a solution that can be embraced by all certainly that is the desire of farmers and ranchers that i
