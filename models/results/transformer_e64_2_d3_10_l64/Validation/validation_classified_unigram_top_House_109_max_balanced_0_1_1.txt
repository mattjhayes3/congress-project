my good friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this

"lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and failure to protect our borders is a national security issue and i come to you tonight with some doturbing news the threat is even more serious than many americans know tucson arizona is 65 miles from mexico i have it here on the map it is shown by the red dot it is the route to two interstates one going north and south and one going east and west just southeast of tucson arizona is the university of arizona technology park on that park which is surrounded by an oldfashioned chain link fence is a technology firm called raytheon raytheon is a defense contractor that makes tomahawk cruise missiles well neighbors in tucson arizona have sent me some pictures of what appears to be illegal entry into the perimeter of this plant here we have the chain link fence this photograph is taken inside the perimeter on these premises 400 acres is the raytheon plant it is true there is another fence around raytheon that is a fence that is a cable type fence that keeps trucks from coming through but someone of course could crawl underneath or over that particular fence and you see there is all types of litter inside the fence and the question occurs where does this come from these are trails that are similar to what you see along the texas border where i am from but border towns down in southeast texas dont have a plant that makes tomahawk cruise missiles tucson neighbors say these trails are filled with trash backpacks water bottles and clothes and why is that well it seems that the illegals that come from mexico sneak under this fence and hide on these 400 acres until the human smugglers come back later and pick them up and transport them throughout the united states raytheon public relations officials have said well they hadnt heard anything about it from the security and they have strict security procedures to enter that facility but a supervisor at raytheon security said yes illegals have been known to come through the grounds but they were just passing through and some illegals have been found working at the raytheon plant by subcontractors but they were ordered off the premises i would like to show you some more disturbing photographs that the tucson neighbors have sent me this is a photograph taken inside the perimeter of the chain link fence and you see numerous backpacks where illegals have come in to the perimeter have hidden on the premises when the human smugglers come to pick them up and take them into the heartland of america they bring with them the backpacks that allow them to change clothes it is somewhat disturbing to me that we have this contractor that makes tomahawk missiles that allows this to occur on their premises because you see lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and you would think that a company that has submitted a border security plan for the department of homeland security just 2 weeks ago would be concerned about their bordertoo after all it is a national security issue i have one more photograph to show you taken on the same premises but on the other end of the perimeter a similar photograph of backpacks water bottles left by the people that illegally entered the united states how ironic that it is that they hide on the premises of a place and an institution that is trying to protect the national security of the united states the raytheon problems are our problems because the unitedstates mexico border is not secure we have to stop the illegal entry at the border between the united states and mexico otherwise we will continue to see these backpacks throughout the united states and some may have clothes but some may also bring in to the united states property and explosives that could damage the united states it is a national security issue it is a border security issue we have an obligation to the american people and have to have the moral will to protect the borders and the

all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you

are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students

determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when

tantamount to a federal felony murder rule and it presents constitutional issues as well as questions of the appropriateness of the death penalty in certain cases the provisions of this bill will be duplicative of state jurisdiction laws in many instances and actually conflicting with others one such conflict would be where a state has chosen not to authorize capital punishment and the federal government pursues the death penalty against that states wishes another concern we always have to consider is expansion of the death penalty when we know that there is a frequent error rate in applying the death penalty one study showed that 68 percent of the death penalty decisions by the trial court were eventually overturned there is another conflict or difficulty that will arise in the efforts to further international copperation in pursuing suspected terrorists we are already experiencing difficulties in securing the cooperation of the rest of the civilized world in bringing terrorists to justice due to our existing proliferation of death penalty offenses when other countries will not extradite criminals to the united states if they will be subject to the death penalty when we add these difficulties to the other controversial issues as to whether someone who supports an organizations social or humanitarian programs knows that it has been designated as a terrorist

colleague in offering an amendment that would restore funding for the department of housing and urban developments hope vi program created in 1992 by former secretary jack kemp and president bush this program offers to renovate existing public housing sites and replace them with new mixedincome housing this grant program has been remarkably successful in its revitalizing of some of the most troubled and distressed communities we have all seen these conditions that exist in public housing developments throughout the nation dilapidated buildings and homes rampant rodent and insect infestation barely functioning plumbing and sometimes sewage that flows into our childrens playgrounds with high rates of violence and crime these are the conditions that have overtaken too many of our public housing facilities the very same conditions in which too many families are struggling to live and to raise their children this program is aptly named because hope is exactly what these grants supply to our communities i can speak firsthand of the outstanding results of this program i have seen in tampa st petersburg and bradenton areas that have been completely revitalized as a result of hope vi for example in bradenton village the successful partnership between federal and local governments as well as the private sector has restored and revitalized a community that years ago was left crumbling and suffering today bradenton village is a vibrant and thriving area and a testament to the success of the hope vi grant program that success is not limited to florida programs it has been remarkable and responsible for rebuilding substandard housing and replacing them with quality affordable housing across the country it is not just about bricks and mortar by creating more options giving consumers more and better choices in housing education job training and job placement hope vi grants transform lives li 1800 our amendment which i am so pleased to offer with the gentleman from alabama who has been a stalwart friend and supporter of housing programs will ensure that hope vi can continue to deliver on its promises the davisharris amendment seeks to restore 60 million to the hope vi program so it can continue its mission of revitalizing communities across america 60 million is a far cry from the funding hope vi has received in the past but it is enough to keep the program going and keep hope alive and we can continue to make a difference in our local communities let us invest in hope vi and invest in the strength and possibilities of our communities i

strong support for remaining in the world trade organization this is the right decision to make it is the right decision to make because the wto and its predecessor the gatt have served as a catalyst to reduce both tariff and nontariff barriers for unitedstates exports since the formation of the gatt average tariffs in industrialized countries have gone down from 40 to less than 4 percent since the creation of the wto in 1994 unitedstates exports have increased by 300 billion of course the wto has also served as a useful forum to breakdown barriers to unitedstates agricultural exports where

system among our constituencies i find the lack of any serious effort to reform the current wto culture and structure to fix the flaws with the unsatisfactory there are a host of problems with the wto and the number of problems is only growing the wto completely lacks any degree of transparency hearings are closed to the pub lic and public transcripts are not released where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who h4316 are supportive of the unitedstates government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wtos failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the unitedstates with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements this rampant judicial activism is rapidly undermining the support for the wto as the wto is particularly prone to yankeebashing support for the current broken system is perhaps fading fastest here at home a slew of activist decisions against the unitedstates attacking our trade remedy laws and another decision amounting to micromanagement of unitedstates tax policy have come at a steady pace these decisions have been particularly frustrating to many members of congress because of limited opportunity for oversight by congress of the wto or its decisions which affect our domestic laws and domestic employers i along with several of my ways and means colleagues last congress introduced the trade law reform act this legislation included a provision to establish a wto dispute settlement review commission this commission composed of retired federal judges would report to congress after reviewing wto decisions adverse to the unitedstates in order to determine whether the relevant decision makers failed to follow the applicable standard of review or otherwise abused their mandate today we have spent two hours debating whether congress should withdraw from the wto yet absent a new entity to administer and advance rulesbased trade there is no question that we must remain committed to and engaged in the wto i would submit that instead of debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate on ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better the unitedstates must move swiftly to put an end to judicial activism in the wto and reorganize the structure and culture of both the appellate body and the dispute settlement body additionally the ustr should deputize private parties

have beenissuing ratings on the likelihood of an issuers default on debt payments since the early 20th century today credit rating agencies rate companies countries and bonds despite being often underestimated and overlooked their power is immense credit rating agencies have a great impact on the bottom line of companies municipalities and school districts the better the credit rating the lower the interest rate that the borrower must pay this expansive influence finally came into question because of the recent corporate scandals and the fact that the two largest nrsros standard poors and moodys rated enron and worldcom at investment grade just prior to their bankruptcy filings essentially they told the market that enron and worldcom were safe investments even though their problems were very apparent in the marketplace as a result reforming the rating agency industry has been the subject of much debate in the house committee on financial services s ps and moodys monitoring and reviewing of enron and worldcom fell far below the careful efforts one would have expected from organizations whose ratings hold so much importance and enron and worldcom were not their only problems but what are the other options that are out there there are 130 credit rating agencies in the financial market however only five are rated and designated as nrsros by the sec this label is the root of the problem the sec coined the term nrsro without defining it in its 1975 rule on net capital requirements when it obligated brokerdealers to hold more capital for those bonds rated junk by a nrsro since then other regulators in the private investment community have taken up the term but also without defining it as a result credit ratings matter only if they are issued by an nrsro the commission still has never defined the term and it has been over 30 years it is more than naive to assume that the sec will actually define it now their track record is not encouraging to receive the illusive distinction companies must be nationally recognized this artificial barrier to entry has created a chickenandtheegg situation for nonnrsro credit rating agencies trying to enter this industry as a result of the artificial barrier to entry there are only five nrsros reputable credit rating firms have been unable to receive this distinction after trying for as long as a decade firms like egan jones in my home state of pennsylvania receive no explanation from the sec because no process actually exists this secimposed barrier to entry has consolidated the industry thus fostering a duopoly moodys and s p enjoy over 80 percent of the market share and rate 99 percent of the debt in the market as a result moodys and s p are raking in record fees since 2000 moodys and s p have earned average annual returns on assets of 37 and 39 percent respectively over a 6year period this compares to the average return on assets over the same period earned by unitedstates manufacturing firms of less than 5 percent per year these excessive profits are governmentgranted to those two nrsros by virtue of the special status granted to them by the government as a result of this lack of competition the quality of ratings has decreased prices are inflated innovation has been stifled and anticompetitive industry practices have been allowed in conflicts of interest like tying notching and
