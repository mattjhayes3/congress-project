eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.03756153583526611,

resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution

secretary for natural resources and environment in this capacity mr crowell will supervise the forest service and shape and implement public forest management policy mr crowell was formerly an attorney for georgia pacific corp before it was forced to divest itself of some of its holdings as part of an antitrust agreement at that time he became general counsel for the louisiana pacific corp a company formed from georgia pacifics divested assets louisiana pacific is the second largest lumber producer in the nation and purchases more public timber than any other company in addition to serving as counsel for these corporations mr crowell aggressively promoted dramatic nonsustainable increases in national forest timber sales and other controversial forest policies which would largely benefit huge timber corporations mr crowell has spent his entire career as an attorney and spokesman for the major timber corporations as such he has been an outspoken advocate for the management of our public lands for the single use of timber management above all other uses he is the wrong choice to oversee the forests that belong to all the american people he is the wrong choice to direct the agency legally responsible for carrying out perpetually sustainable multipleuse management of these lands as someone who represented the largest public timber purchaser in the country mr crowell promoted the industrys point of view on a number of issues the small business setaside program national forest management act regulations clearcut sizes strearnside buffer strips departures from the forest services evenflow nondeclining yield formula and others on all of these issues mr crowells efforts were expended to maximize timber production from the forests at the expense of the rest of the multiple uses if the senate confirms this nomination i fear that the 190millionacre national forest system will suffer the same kind of abusive management that has befallen the private forests mr crowells confirmation will put the timber industry in charge of the national forests when that happens our public lands will face the same irresponsible cutandrun mismanagement and soil and watershed degrading harvest practices that have wreaked havoc on the private industries own timberlands the private industrial forests are now running out of timber and the industry is casting its rapacious eyes on the last oldgrowth reserves in the public forests mr crowells own public statements on forestry issues indicate that he will facilitate this dismal process mr crowell wants to eliminate restrictions on clearcut sizes he opposes designing them to enhance wildlife habitat and minimize visual impacts this is despite the fact that clearcutting the national forests was considered so objectionable it was almost eliminated by the monongahela decision after a great national debate on this and other forestry issues the congress passed the national forest managemnent act this critically important act included specific language to mitigate the effects clearcutting could have on esthetics on wildlife habitat and on soil and water resources in opposing these clearcutting standards mr crowell puts timber production first because of fear that such mitigation procedures might reduce maximum harvest levels mr crowell wants to harvest more timber from streamnside buffer strips again timber production has a priority over watershed values and the protection of fishery resources timber harvesting and its associated roadbuilding has caused extensive damage to our formerly productive anadtomous fisheries the watersheds of the national forests are our last reservoir of habitat of this valuable sport and commercial fishery thoughtless shorttermi excessively timber oriented management of the national forests can eliminate this habitat reservoir streaniside buffer strips are critically important for fishery production and ought to receive maximum protection from timber harvest mr crowell has opposed wilderness allocations because they reduce timber production disregarding the other multiple uses that wilderness provides to all the people these multiple uses provided by wilderness are available in perpetuity at little or no cost if however the national forests are to be dedicated as industrial tree farms with timber production paramount those multiple uses will be degraded future management costs for restoring those cutover lands will fall on the taxpayer mr crowell has aggressively opposed the small business timber sale setaside program louisiana pacific georgia pacific and the others claimn timber production as the dominant use of the rational forests they seek to minimize protlectlon of the other uses of the forest in the same way they want total control of the marketplace through elimination of the protection offered to small firms by the sbas setaside program without that program of course the smaller firms would be quickly driven out of business by the major timber corporations mr crowell has been the chief industry spokesman in this effort all of these examples demonstrate a mind set of maximizing timber production for the benefit of these corporations regardless of the cost to the environment sustainable yield of resources or to smaller independent timber companies this attitude is further reflected by mr crowiells insistence that the national forests increase harvest rates of the countrys last reserves of oldgrowth timber by departing from the evenflow nondeclining yield harvest formula this extremely irresponsible demand will produce a shortterm gain for some but will leave the northwest and other regions facing a dramatic shortage of timber in the future the cost to timberdependent communities millworkers and overcut regions will be severe what georgia pacific louisiana pacific and most timber companies want of course is to increase timber production from the national forests it is a laudable goal which i fully support provided that the harvest level is sustainable and that other forest resources are not degraded in the process mr crowell and others have long advocated the best way to increase harvest levels would be to scrap the evenflow nondeclining yield formula for determining harvests mr crowell has called this formulawhich says that we must only harvest as much timber as we can replace absurd i strongly disagree when congress passed the national forest management act of 1976 nfma it was widely hailed by both the timber industry and environmental groups as one of the most farsighted and progressive pieces of forestry legislation ever established the act affirmed that the publics forests are to be managed for all the multiple usestimber production watersheds fisheries wildlife and recreation among others under the act all of these resources are to be managed on a sustainedyield basis but one of the acts most basic principlesone that is absolutely crucial to maintaining longterm steady production of timber from our national forestsis the concept of evenflow nondeclining yield this concept was made part of the act to guarantee that national forest timber is managed to provide a perpetually sustainable supply of timber if we cut too fast we will not have the trees essential to maintain a strong forest economy without the evenflow nondeclining yield protected firmly in law w6 could easily see pressures for shortterm profits erode our longterm base supply of timber much of the timber industry if guilty of overcutting their own lands yet continues to press for the elimination of the evenflow formula it is clear that many large timber companies are perfectly willing to sacrifice the longterm economic wellbeing of thousands of millworkers in order to reap quick prof its h11714 co i sincerely hoped that when confronted with the responsibilities of administering the multipleuse sustained yield act and the national forest management act mr crowell would temper his outlook after all the assistant secretary is expected to manage public resources in a balanced fashion for all uses and interests not remain an advocate for singleuse timber management this hope was darkened by mr crowels response during his confirmation hearing one of the more significant opinions he expressed was that it would be possible to increase timber harvests to around 35 billion board feet per year from our national forests this would mean that present harvest levels would be tripled it would cause widespread degradation of noncommodity forest resourcesour watersheds fisheries wildlife and recreational opportunities such a policy would mean the end of the evenflow formula and rapidly complete the liquidation of the pacific northwests oldgrowth forest oldgrowth forests are an irreplaceable resource at present harvest rates we have only a 30 to 50year supply liquidation of this reserve at an even faster rate runs the grave risk of causing a dramatic decline in future harvest levels of course the liquidation of the northwests old growth is of less concern to the timber corporations represented by mr crowell than it is to smaller companies and independent mills it is of less concern to the major timber corporations than it is to the miliworkers and timberdependent communities in the northwest the big corporations are already making plans to leave the northwest they can move their operations to the southeastern united states to southeast asia to brazil the smaller companies and their employees are left to watch the clearcuts grow back this was not merely an offhand statement by mr crowell it is a reflection of a mind set of someone who has long served the interests of major timber corporations it is a policy which has been advocated by them for years to see someone who holds that point of view given authority over the forest service ought to deeply disturb those concerned with sustained yield management of our natural resources the timber industry is fond of saying that it is more efficient to liquidate our reserves of oldgrowth timber because it is dead decadent and dying they want to cut it as fast as possible so that it can be replaced by thrifty young stands they portray the oldgrowth forests as on the verge of collapse and themselves as heroes for rescuing the public from imminent resource waste this line is sheer nonsense those forests have been standing for 200 300 400 years or longer they are at an equilibrium between mortality and new growth they are not going to fall down and go to

and allows them to select sale sites as ties in his role as general counsel for a result all forest service actions in the parent corporation and potential alaska are bound to effect kpc and conflicts of interest in actions the unitedstates louisiania pacific in a direct way forest service might take against mr crowell has promised to remove kpc as a result of that guilty verdict himself from involvement in any spethe court found that kpc and alas cif ic matter effecting louisiana pacifkan lumber pulp co a japanese ic does this mean that he will avoid having to do with all forest service activities related to timber management in alaska apparently so the forest service has several actionis that it could pursue in response to the antitrust verdict of guilty the conspirators manipulated stumpage values by falsely reporting the costs of harvests and the price of materials sold stumpage value manipulation is a breach of contract the forest service could sue the corporation to recover funds lost to the treasury the forest service could discharge the 50year contracts the forest service could debar the firms from bidding on timber sales in the tongass it strains credibility to assume that the personnel within the agency would be insensitive to their assistant secretarys past association with louisiana in considering these options the activities ofgeorgia pacific and louisiana pacific are so closely tied to usfs actions and policies it is difficult to imagine that mr crowell would not be continually confronted with potential conflicts of interest for example how can he deal with the issue of departures from the evenflow nondeclining yield formula when the nations major public timber purchaser louisiana pacific would obviously benefit how will he deal with the issue of log exports and enforce the federal regulations against the substitution of federal timber for privately exported logs when his former employers may benefit from such activities mr crowell presided over a national forest products association task force which recommended weakening n m a regulations dealing with clearcut sizes and harvesting within streamside buffer zones how can he deal in a balanced fashion with regulatory changes that will dramatically effect watershed qualities fisheries forest diversity and oldgrowth forests when weakening of these regulations will have a direct financial benefit to his former employers and other timber companies in mr crowells reclusal statement he said that he would not involve himself in any matters regarding the sbas timber sale setaside

severe economic problems congress must use its wisdom creativity courage and statesmanship to solve them we must act quickly because the people of this country have suffered too long ou economy is beset by an inflation rate teetering on the brink of running away a growing real tax burden and an adverse regulatory environment leading to a slowing of the growth of our real gross national product serious underinvestment aggravating a failure to achieve a reasonable strategy for longrun economic growth negative productivity growth in the american business sector in the past year and the lowest productivity growth of any industrial nation the past 10 years as the american manufacturing plant continues to age and a continuing gnawing problem of heavy structural unemployment especially among blacks and teenagers clearly the major economic concerns of americans today are inflation taxes federal deficits government regulation and structural unemployment today as ranking house minority member of the joint economic committee i am introducing a package of legislation which can serve as a republican economic program to solve the foregoing list of economic ills the goal of the package is to stimulate economic growth and curb inflation it incorporates the best economic proposals of the last congress it is in the forefront of sound modern economic theory which takes into account both the supply side and demand side of our economy the economic package contains five elements tax reform reduced federal spending savings promotion reduced federal regulation and a targeted program to cure structural unemployment i believe this is a wellbalanced program and it hits at the key sore spots in our economy in recent years policymakers have been at a loss to explain why inflation and unemployment have been so stubborn the fact is inflation and unemployment have only been as inflexible as the policymakers the policymakers have lumped tax policy and spending policy in one categoryfiscal policyand have lost all flexibility by treating it as one rigid policy tool they have linked fiscal policy to monetary policy in rigid fashion as well monetary and fiscal policies were either both too tight or both too easy all stop or all go demand was pumped up or drawn down no attention at all was paid to supply policy or to ways in which tax policy could be used independently to affect costs prices employment and growth inflation is too much money chasing too few goods the trick is to fight inflation by reducing money growth while stimulating production the supply of goods and servicesthrough carefully designed tax reduction and restructuringand reducing the growth of federal spending to eliminate federal borrowing and crowding out these targeted policies some easy and some tight could solve our problems in recent years we have pumped up demand by increasing spending and creating money faster than ever we have had the biggest deficits in history we assumed that supply would automatically rise to satisfy the demand this policy did not work output did not respond output did not respond because government has strangled it with higher taxes higher costs and higher regulatory burdens government has pumped up demand and throttled supply no wonder we have had inflalion furthermore that same inflation has only made the supply situation worse inflation lowers the rate of return to every worthwhile growth activity as the reward falls the activity declines inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets the marginal taxes taken out of each costofliving raise have reached amazing levels even middleincome taxpayers now face tax rates of 40 to 50 percent on each additional dollar earned in fact if the trend of 197279 continues by 1986 everyone with an income of 20 000 in 1972 purchasing power will be in the 50percent marginal bracket the high and rising marginal tax burdens have reduced the rate of return to labor there has been no increase in real aftertax spendable earnings for the average worker since 1965 extra effort is taxed at record rates workers have substituted leisure early retirement and nontaxable fringe benefits for added work and added pay saving is also hard hit the aftertax reward to saving is miserably inadequate in view of the great social service that saving performs saving is inherently double taxed income is taxed when earned if it is spent on a good or service only a small sales tax is incurred if it is saved the service acquiredinterest or dividendsis taxed at rates up to 70 percent inflation increases this doubletax burden as it pushes taxpayers toward the upper brackets reducing the reward to saving even further taxpayers have substituted consumption for saving and taxsheltered saving for ordinary saving the supply of saving to the stock bcnd and other credit markets for u e by ordinary business has been choked off inflation has caused a gross understatement of depreciation the amount of plant and equipment that is wearing out as a result business profits are overstated and taxes are overpaid by 25 to 30 percent the rate of return on the use of equipment is reduced leading to a drop in desired investment the cost of just standing still increases as depreciation allowed by the tax code proves inadequate to replace old machinery even as overstated taxes and mandated pollution control spending reduce corporate cash flow firms must dip into that cash flow to pay inflated prices for new machines little is left over to raise dividends or make higher interest payments to overcome the reduced desire to save on the part of taxpayers the supply of credit to business is further reduced and the cost of that credit increased by the increasing preemption of our limited supply of sayings by government borrowing to fund the federal deficit the general profitability of business is further eroded by an enormous regulatory burden the cost of which is now in the neighborhood of 100 billion a year almost 5 percent of gnp it reduces productivity and discourages all forms of production it curbs the use of plant and equipment labor and land it exacerbates inflation and results in the underemployment of every conceivable factor of production how do we fight this situation there is no great mystery the methods have been thoroughly studied and are ready to use if we only have the will here is the program to fight inflation and defend the value of the dollar curb the creation of new money to keep slower money growth from causing a credit crunch and recession get the government out of the credit market by curbing the growth of government spending to end the deficits to further increase the supply of credit for real growth encourage saving by cutting personal tax rates and index the personal income tax to keel inflation from undoing the tax cut institute tax incentives for additional saving to offset the double taxation which saving now faces to encourage business to use the added saving to produce real growth enact replacement cost or indexed depreciation encourage the employment of all inputs in their most efficient uses by cutting corporate tax rates to discourage the use of shelters to prevent the taxation of illusory capital gains due only to inflation adjust the purchase price of capital assets for inflation when calculating taxable gains to reduce our soaring regulatory burdens abolish existing regulations that are excessive duplicative or contradictory require that regulations be drafted to minimize costs to consumers and businessmen establish a regulatory budget which puts a cap on the cost each federal agency or department could impose on the private sector to increase work effort and the supply of labor reduce personal tax rates and index the income tax to keep inflation from undoing the tax cut to make untrained workers employable institute a wage subsidy for the hiring of unskilled workers putting the hardcore unemployed into real training programs in the private sector delay further increases in the minimum wage in order to prevent thousands of teenagers and unskilled workers from being priced out of the

provisions encouraging increased personal savings by all americans a brief history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"], [0.9538145065307617, 0.9538145065307617, 0, "jocko conlan whose son john b conlan jr is a former member of congress is a hall of fame umpire who officiated in the

congress and as an american of irish descent i would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the efforts of this group to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern ireland the friends of ireland came together primarily out of concern over the violence prevailing in northern ireland our objective is not only to develop a close working relationship with the republic of ireland but also to inform the american public of all aspects of the conflict working toward a solution which will respect the rights and traditions of all the inhabitants of northern ireland two recent events relating to northern ireland seem to me to hold out hope for an end to the fighting the first is the result of a poll conducted by the london sunday times among the people of northern ireland which offers a revealing glimpse of the mood and aspirations of both catholics and protestants more important it suggests promising directions for future talks the sunday times poll shows that contrary to the stereotypes arising out of the endless violence the vast majority of the people of northern ireland are strongly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political ends even the tiny violentminded minority has declined radically in the past few years negotiations toward an adequate political solution would receive overwhelming popular support right now furthermore the results of the poll show that although the majority and minority have radically different views of the ideal settlement there is common ground between them two thirds of all respondents representing a crosssection of the population indicated that they would aecept a settlement based on an independent assembly with powersharing guarantees for the catholic minoritythe principle embodied in the sunningdale agreement in 1973 which was blocked at the time by extremist elements eight years of violence are a powerful argument against extremists on both sides other poll results indicate that the political polarization which led to the election of irish repuiblican army terrorists and protestant hardliners in the last election has decreased and may diminish further if moderation ii 4493 results in progress toward a settlement however continuation in the status quo may cause this conciliatory mood to evaporate especially among the catholic minority the sunday times poll notes a vast and growing gulf between the catholic community and the british government the british army originally welcomed as protectors by an embattled minority have earned the fear and dislike of most catholicsnot just the ira and its sympathizers this gulf however could narrow if the government demonstrates a willingness to make concessions to the minority point of view abandoning the narrowmindcd approach which is leading to increased tension in the province a second event may provide a chance to end the current stalemate membe~rs of the irish commission on justice and peace an agency of the catholic church in the republic have succeeded in drafting a settlement which would end the hunger strikes in the maze prison and lessen the tension between the two sides brought on in part by the propaganda victories of the ira i join many of my colleagues in congress in urging that prime minister thatcher and her government review the opportunities presented by this draft and consider the advantages of waiving their insistence on points which serve only to limit british op1 tions in pursuing an end to the violence in its approach to the conflict in northern ireland mrs thatchers government has concentrated on controlling the activities of the ira british government officials in northern ireland appear to view their role as that of the forces of law battling terrorists criminally masquerading as political dissidents in this light better policing may seem to be the key to suppressing the violence however the catholic community has been understandably uncooperative with this effort in the bloody context of irish history the catholic minority cannot see british attempts to stabilize an unsatisfactory social order as anything but continued oppression for the catholics the army brought british rule without british justice due process and protection of individual rights britains most revered legacy to america are notoriously absent from proceedings against alleged terrorists in northern ireland the right to trial by jury protections against selfincrimination the right to counselall are abridged or suspended in the socalled diplock courts set up under the prevention of terrorism act accused terrorists are tried and usually convicted by a single judge as many as 90 percent of convictions are obtained solely on the basis of confessionselicited after an average of 3 days of detention followed by months of waiting for trial in an atmosphere tainted by repeated charges of physih 4494 co cal abuse and psychological torture under the judges rules prevailing in the rest of the united kingdom or under any reasonable judicial system these confessions would be considered highly suspect in the diplock courts they result in a conviction rate of 94 percent most of those arrested and convicted under these procedures are catholic the british government dismissed bobby sands and his compatriots as common criminals perhaps they were but they were not convicted under common conditions bobby sands it is said had a string of murders and terrorist attacks on his conscience he was convicted only of being present in a car in which a gun was found for which he was sentenced to 14 years in jaila term which anywhere else in england would be considered presposterous the british goverrnent claims he was just a common thug but it has never adequately proved that to a jury of his peers let alone the world is it any wonder that men convicted under special procedures demand special treatme t mrs thatcher has refused to negotiate with the prfsoners in the maze in her words one of the most humane and liberal prison systems in the world on principle one does not negotiate with terrorists since the british government has already waived so many of the basic principles of british justice in northern ireland however one may wonder why this particular principle is of such overriding importance that it must be upheld at the cost of continuing bloodshed at any rate the british government does not object as a rule to negotiating with terrorists lord carrington the british foreign minister recently stated that he was willing to meet with noted terrorist yasir arafat in the interests of peace in the middle east inspired negotiations with rhodesian terrorists led to the birth of the nation of zimbabwe a proud achievement of british foreign policy however suppose the british instead of negotiating with mugabe and his associates had instead cordoned off the suburbs of salisbury and announced that they would defend forever the inhabitants right to remain within the british empire meanwhile allowing this little enclave to govern itself in a fashion repugnant to the principles of british democracy would they be as eager to denounce the violent response of black dissidents as terrorism terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances the vicious behavior of the ira and of the ulster volunteer force serves no legitimate purpose it only poisons the atmosphere and adds to the fear and suffering of the people whose rights these organizations supposedly champion as mrs thatcher has accurately pointed out these terrorist groups are engaged chiefly in deny ng others their first right the right to life random violence and brutal often misdirected retaliations have taken the lives of thousands of innocents since the fighting began in 1969 1 am proud that the efforts of prominent irishamerican politicians have succeeded in dimninishing the american base of support for ira operations and i hope that by participating in the activities of the friends of ireland i will help to diminish that support still further americans of irish descent must understand that support for the ira whether direct or channeled through organizations such as the irish northern aid society recently ordered by a federal district court to register as an agent of the ira can only inflict further suffering on tht people of northern ireland catholic as well as protestant aid to extremists will only thwart any efforts to moderate the conflict and end the violence mrs thatchers government has stated that it considers its prime responsibility in northern ireland to be protection of the lives of its citizens all other considerations are secondary this is an approach made in good faith to a tragic and seemingly intractable political impasse and it is true that the violence has abatedat least outside the detention centerssince the terrifying days when the british army first marched in to rescue the catholics of bogside from their fellow citizens however the authoritarian attitude carries with it certain risks selective protection of rights under an arbitrary system of justice amounts at best to order without law in short tyranny clearly the catholic community sees it that way the sunday times poll shows that the catholic community in belfast overwhelmingly disapproves of the british governments handling of the situation in northern ireland their profound and increasing alienation is demonstrated in the same poll by increasing despair about the prospect of peace in the future especially among the young after hundreds of years of oppression and 50 years of gerrymandering discrimination and the hostility of the ruling class the catholic minority took its cue from the american civil rights movement of the sixties and began to march for civil rights and an equitable share of power in the local government this movement was met almost immediately with violence in 1969 as in 1914 the extremists of the ruling order were the first to arm mrs thatchers government in denouncing the undeniable atrocities of the ira should keep in mind what the catholics of belfast and bogside have never forgottenthat the provisional ira was born out of catholic fear to defend the minority against the ulster police and their auxiliary thugs mrs thatcher justifies her attitude toward the ira by saying that ~ if 1 the bomb is seen to succeed then the terrorist has beaten the ballot box 0 but the catholics of northern ireland have never had much success with the ballot box people who cannot turn to statesmen for protection will inevitably turn to terrorists the ira will continue however unjustly to win the propaganda war until the british government can offer its citizens more than the unpalatable choice between repression and lawlessness in 1969 the catholic minority demanded civil rights and found itself in danger of mass violence the british government has protected their lives to a certain extent but their original aspirations civil rights and equitable representation have been all but forgotten in the drive to impose order on an unresolved conflict most catholics now identify the british army as an ally of the other side the claim that british rule weighs equally heavily on the protestant majority is hardly credible to a people who remember that the arrival of the army was followed by mass internment a barbaric action directed almost exclusively against the catholic community or who listen to the pronouncements of a government which alternates assurances to the majority that their wishes will forever be respected with denunciations of the ira as the root of all evil in the province more years of military rule in northern ireland will have anything but a stabilizing effect continuation of the present order can only result in further alienation of the catholic community perpetuate violence and increase despair it is time to stop wasting the lives of british soldiers and irish civilians trying to maintain an unworkable status quo the settlement drafted by the irish commission for justice and peace offers a ray of hope in the grim impasse between british prison authorities and ira prisoners i urge the government to seize this opportunity it is rare for the ira to show signs of moderation such concessions must be rewarded if northern irish politics are to recover from their sectarian paralysis the people of northern ireland are weary of violence most would be ready to accept a reasonable settlement concessions on both sides would improve the climate for achieving such a settlement and lighten the despairing view of the future held by most of the catholic minority this chance is too important to be thrown away for the sake of a hypocritical and inconsistent principle sidney smith a british essayist of the 19th century once observed sourly thatthe moment the very name of ireland is mentioned the gnglish seem to bid adieu to common feeling common prudence and common sense and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots unfortunately the history of british rule in ireland bears out this bitter view the british government is no mere impartial peacekeeping force the army bias in favor of one side has become so obvious that one observer has characterized its role as that of the third combatant britain bears a heavy responsibility for the distrust and hatred prevailing in northern ireland today so far the response of the british government to the irishi commission proposal has been discouraging

what has happened to the initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9350451827049255, 0.9350451827049255, 0, "the escalation in armed hostilities in el salvador over the last several weeks and the administrations stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with the strict provisions of statute contained in the war powers act"], [0.9276004433631897, 0.9276004433631897, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that the committee on post office and civil service be discharged from further consideration of the joint resolution

illinois stated that his disapproval resolution does not violate the concept of home rule because language restrictions are often times attached to the annual appropriation bills for the district of columbia he went on to cite examples such as the provision prohibiting the use of funds to implement a hiring system that uses a drawing to rank prospective police officers and firefighters who pass the written test the restriction on the transfer of sludge outside the district of columbia and the denial of funds for the local gambling board let me make it very clear that certainly congress can and does place restrictions on the use of funds but there is really no comparison between restrictions on the use of money and the disapproval of a local ordinance which has been approved by locally elected officials let me explain why with respect to the police and fire hiring policy the language placed in the appropriation bill does indeed prohibit the city from implementing the system of a drawing to detcrmine the selection order of those who pass the written test but this system was put in place as an administrative matter by the mayor with the city councils consent it did not go through the length process which gives all those who wish a chance to be heard on an issue and results in an ordinane that comes from those most directly involved on the second issue the house merely provided a temporary 60day delay in the transporting of sludge to a new landfill that is much different than completely turning around a statute that has been debated and approved by the local legislature and chief executive concerning the gambling board there was no language in the appropriation bill prohibiting the use of funds for implementing the gambling initiative the house did absolutely nothing on that proposal so the gentlemens argument that his disapproval resolution does nothing more than what is done through language on appropriation bills is spurious and not supported by the facts let me say at this point that even though language provisions are included on appropriation bills many members feel that it is wrong for the congress to dictate how the local government should spend revenues which for the most part are raised from taxes fees and charges imposed on local residents i realize this is an emotional issue and that many of the points in d c act 469 may not have been fully explained arid although the congress has the authority to place language in an appropriations measure that limits the use of funds or delays an effective date there can be no question in anyones mind that such language provisions are entirely different than disapproving a local ordinanceone that has received the benefit of public hearings and the leadership and approval of a locally elected mayor and city council the facts do not support the comparison the gentleman from illinois attempted to make earlier and even if the facts were accurate one wrong does not justify another regardless the gentlemans disapproval resolution goes deeper in that it pierces the veil of integrity as far as the issue of local selfgovernment and home rule are concerned it is clear that the government of the district of columbia acted within its authority in passing the sexual assault reform act in doing so it was acting within the authority which is was granted under the home rule act of 1973 passage of this resolution of disapproval would be a clear and dangerous violation of home rule although since 1973 there have been 10 resolutions of disapproval considered in only one instance when the council attempted to dictate location of chanceries was such a resolution passed and the law overturned in that instance there was a clear and compelling federal interest i do not believe such a case can be made here it should be noted that some 24 states have enacted provisions regarding sexual assault and sexual conduct among consenting adults which are consistent with the law passed by the district of columbia city council beyond this fact though this act neither violates the constitution exceeds the authority granted under home rule nor violates a federal interest it is a sad day when the clarion call of a small band of zealots in this body railroad legitimately enacted laws because those laws do not meet their standard of morality the singleminded nature of this resolution will make a mockery of progress toward home rule here in the district of columbia passage of this disapproval will assure the residents of this city that for all the talk about home rule and the need to encourage selfgovernance the congress remains ready to step in whenever it is so inclined to second guess the actions of this citys lawfully elected government such a mixture of

it is the understanding of the conferees that the resolution contains sufficient funds and authority to operate the office of adolescent pregnancy for the duration of the resolution to maintain the option for congress to consider future funding for the adolescent family life program there is no statement in the conference agreement concerning the public health service hospitals under the rate of operations prescribed by the resolution the secretary would have 25 million available for conversion activities for those hospitals whose conversion plans are approved chairman natcher and senator schmitt agreed during the conference to write the secretary a letter indicating that he should maintain as much flexibility as possible in funding and approving conversion proposals since more funds for conversion might be forthcoming in the fiscal 1982 appropriations bill in regard to pay and related issues the senate rcceded on an amendment no 13 which had proposed a relaxation of the federal pay cap in the house bill to the extent that increases would have been allowed for executive levels iii iv and v the effect of the conferees action is to extend the pay cap for members of congress high executive branch officials and the judiciary through november 20 1981 house conferees receded to the senate on amendment no 35 which eliminates the 25 000 ceiling on honoraria which can be received in any year by federal employees including members of the unitedstates senate house members are limited to 15 percent of congressional salary for such income amendment no 38 also includes language providing a permanent appropriation in future years for ~compensation of members as authorized by law at levels recommended by the president for other federal employees the conferees also agreed to remove the statutory 3 000 limit on living expenses which can be deducted from federal taxes by members of congress while away from home amendment no 46 states that it is the sense of congress that limits on such deductions should be the same as the limits for businessmen and other private citizens on the issue oi the report language which relates to amtrak rail service i must say that i am dismayed with the decision to extend special treatment to the cardinal train this train represents the most political route in the amtrak system it has failed consistently to attain the congressionally required criteria for longhaul trains yet it remains in service for a select few a recent amtrak management recommendation to the amtrak board of directors indicates that this route again fails to meet the performance criteria that we had estatiished in this congress after a great deal of debate in fact the route is projected to attain only 122 passengermiles per trainmile figure the requirement for continuation of this line has been decided by the congress to be no less than 150 the report states it is therefore our judgment that the cardinal should be discontinued it is ludicrous to offer special treatment to this poor performance train at the expense of superior train routes which can better serve the publics traveling needs i am pleased to report that there is no language in this resolution which precludes the secretary of transportation from implementing the washington national airport policy plan the resolution offers the secretary the necessary flexibility regarding implementation as many of you are aware the plan is designed to assure the maximum safety of air operations in the washington area reduce noise and congestion at national airport and encourage the greater use of dulles international airport this longoverdue plan is one which should not be sidetracked by a few special interest groups the policy attempts to balance the competing interests of airlines their passengers congress and the residents of the washington area in developing this equitable plan safety as always was given the highest priority"]], "top_unsure":

legislation highlights a very important problem that law enforcement has throughout the nation and that is to locate and identify missing children as well as to provide some kind of central clearinghouse for unidentified dead there is nothing more heartwrenching for parents than to have their children missing not knowing the whereabouts of their youngsteis and not knowing whether they are alive or dead the problems that law enforcement has had in tracking down missing children have been accentuated in several very highly publicized cases where children have either been found brutually beaten or dead or after an expense that runs into the tens of thousands of dollars have been tracked down through private detective agencies alive and returned to their parents i do believe however that it is important to state that this legislation is not a panacea for all of the problems related to tracking down missing children perhaps it has been oversold by some of our friends in the news media the fbi has maintained an unidentified persons file since 1975 that file has applied to people of all ages not just to children or other unemancipated people the big problem that the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights discovered during the course of its hearings is that the entry of names and physical descriptions of missing children by local law enforcement officials has been spotty at best i am proud to say the testimony revealed that local law enforcement in my own home state of wisconsin ranked first among the 50 states in utilizing the ncic file but some local law enforcement officials have not entered the names of one missing person child or adult into this file even though the tool is and has been available the committee report indicates that fbi statistics show that only 10 percent of all missing persons are ever entered into the system furthermore the subcommittee on investigations and general oversight of the labor and human resources committee of the other body conducted a survey of 25 of the nations 35 largest police departments which showed that only 14 to 24 percent of missing children had been reported to the fbis ncic missing persons file so i would hope that the debate over this legislation and the passage of this legislation would provide a hint to local law enforcement that really the burden is on them to utilize the machinery that has been available in the fbi since 1975 as well as the additional powers that are created in this bill in my judgment an equally important element of this legislation involves the unidentified dead file although the fbi has been conducting a pilot program in colorado for the past 2 years with the express intention of expanding it nationwide when testing is complete the system created by this legislation will be new to the law and it should help identify missing persons generally including unemancipated children there is nothing worse than to have lost a loved one and not to know whether he or she is alive or dead in this sense the parents and families of missing persons are in much the same emotional position as the parents and families of mias in vietnam in sum even though i have reservations as to whether this legislation will be as effective as some of his supporters believe i urge its adoption by this body and hope that state and local law enforcement will learn from it and devote a higher priority to missing children particularly children who disappear within their jurisdictional borders i yield 5 mhiutes to the gentleman from florida but before doing so i would like to publicly commend him for his tireless work in pushing this legislation through both the subcommittee and the full committee without his efforts this bill probably would not be

attempt to address in part the critical and growing problem of our nations serious defeiency in language skills this measure would create a new post within the state department of the assistant secretary for language services to be responsible for administration of a new bureau of language services for those of my colleagues who may question the need for the legislation which i am today proposing there are a couple of points which i would bring to their attention these concern the very great importance of competent linguists to our foreign policy th ability of our language specip1 qt to do the job under preseit circumstances and the overall language problem in the united states today first the importance of linguists in the conduct of unitedstates foreign policy perhaps the most important point to be made here is that performing translation or interpretation services for our nations diplomats is more than a skillit is an art diplomats are concerned as few others are with the nuance of language and it is the task of the interpreter to convey subtleties of meaning while traversing the frequently immense gaps between languages mistakes can be not only costly but disastrous recall as an example president carters message to the polish people that he lusted for them when in fact he merely desired to be their friend barbara gamareklan writing in the new york times recently provided a vivid description of the critical role of a state department linguist the diplomatic interpreter is an intrinsic part of the highwire act of international diplomacy bringing to the job skills that go far beyond a simple translation of words interpreters must deal under great pressure with egos as large as those of lyndon b johnson and fidel castro and with issues as momentous as disarmament and hostages in iran they must know the latest technological and economic terms must somehow convey puns must communicate emotions gestures and diplomatic politeness obviously we must have highly skilled professionals to fill the ranks of our linguist corps the next question is then how well are our language specialists performing today the answer is i think extremely wellunder the circumstances the fact of the matter is that with the present office of language services deeply submerged within the administrative hierarchy of the state department we are courting a disaster similar to that which befell president carter in warsaw consider for a moment if you will the organizational structure of the state department at the present time in addition to the immediate office of the secretary of state the offices of several under secretaries of state and a handful of other offices there are a total of 17 bureaus in the state departmenta bureau of consular affairs refugee programs european afi 711 h 712 co fairs and so forth one of the largest of these is the bureau of administration and it is here that we must look to find our corps of professional linguists under the deputy assistant secretary for operations within the office of facilities management and administrative services sandwiched between the audiovisual services division and the claims staff in the state department directory we at long last arrive at the language services division where a cadre of some of the most highly trained professionals in our government provide liaison between the united states and the myriad of nations and languages with whom we interact still one may ask what is the need for an entirely new bureau solely for language services the answer is that our linguists must have greater and more direct access to those they servethe secretary of state the president and otherswithout the need to work through a complex web of intermediaries the following incident will serve as an example of this when president carter prepared for his visit to warsaw in 1979 members of the white house staff alerted the language services division at the state department of the need for a polish interpreter the division selected a linguist for the job and informed the white house staff that the interpreter would need to accompany president carter aboard air force one to warsaw discuss the nature of the speech the president would deliver and review the presidents notes in preparation those requests were denied the interpreter was flown into warsaw aboard a commercial airline left standing in the rain at the tarmac with the press and public waiting for the presidents plane to arrive and only at the last moment was a transcript of the presidents remarks thrust into his hands the consequence of this affair was a national embarrassment which few of us have forgotten in the text of my bill i also note the lack of prominent career paths for linguists in the unitedstates government in and of itself this is by no means a justification for the creation of a new bureau for language services but it nonetheless reflects a very real problem this leads me to my third and final point concerning the state of language skills in our country as a whole today a few years ago congressman simonwho has coauthored the bill i am introducing todayand i served on the presidents commission on foreign lpnguage and international studies that panel was created in response to a growing awareness that our countrys businessmen and diplomats were increasingly lacking in skills needed for interaction with other nations the commissions final report characterized our nations incompetence in foreign languages as scandalous the problem may not yet have assumed the dimensions of an energy shortage or arms race or trade deficitbut the signals are ominous in testimony before the house education and labor committee last summer the deputy director of the cia and past director of the national security administration adm bobby inman had this to spy the foreign language capability of our country is poor and getting worse decisive action should be taken on the federal level to ensure improvement in foreign language training in the unitedstates unless we begin to take remedial action today our growing deficiency in foreign language skills will ultimately lead to a less effective diplomatic corps a severely handicapped intelligence apparatus and unitedstates businesses and industries which are not competitive in foreign markets i do not mean to suggest that my bill is a panacea for all these ills but it is an important first step i include the text of my bill at this point for the benefit of my colleagues h r 5738 a bill to improve the translation and interpretation services available to the united states government by providing for the establishment within the department of state of a bureau of language services to be headed by an assistant secretary be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that a the congress finds and declares that 1 the availability of competent linguists for translation and interpretation services is an essential prerequisite for the effective conduct of united states foreign policy and is moreover vital to the natons commercial ventures abroad and foreign intelligence gathering activities 2 there is a critical and growing gap between the needs of united states government agencies for foreign language specialists and the available supply of such specialists and this problem is aggravated by the lack of prominent career paths for linguists in the agencies of the united states government 3 the ability of linguiets presently employed by the united states government to provide translation and interpretation services in a highly competent and proficient manner is impaired by their subordinate status within the administrative structure of the department of state and other agencies and 4 more than 25 agencies of the united states government utilize the services of foreign language specialists and there is a
