michigan has been hit by a crisis of massive proportion its impact on the longterm health and future success of its residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the

congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we

someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas

congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to

today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9925004467368126, 0.0074995532631874084, 1, "from virginia for this legislation being brought to the house floor tonight the foreign aid authorization act first passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our foreign aid this is a commonsense bill and it doesnt cost any money i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9916615337133408, 0.00833846628665924, 1, "today i rise to recognize the second congressional
