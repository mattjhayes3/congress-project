thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would

the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding

let me commend my good friend and colleague the chairman of the full appropriations committee and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on rural development agriculture and the related agencies mr wnirren for his hard work in running the conference and bringing us a bill that i believe the president will sign and that significantly addresses the needs of rural america yet serves an extremely broad spectrum of constituencies i also want to thank the other members of the subcommittee who have worked hard and in a bipartisan manner on behalf of agriculture and of all rural residents they truly recognize the importance of agriculture to the unitedstates economy and to the wellbeing of all americans i also want to thank our staff for their dedicated assistance with 146 amendments containing over 400 items of disagreement i am happy to report to you that most of these have been worked out very satisfactorily from the houses and the administrations point of view let me stress that we had a very difficult task but after 3 a days of meeting with our counterparts in the senate i believe we have a bill that will address the concerns of members on both sides of the aisle and the needs of the american public this years total new budget obligational authority is almost 10 billion below fiscal year 1988 in fiscal year 1988 our bill had 56 18 billion in total obligational authority and this year it is down to 42 512 billion the funding levels of this bill are within the proposed levels in the presidents budget 27 million below the presidents request and 1 986 million below the 302b allocation and the outlay allocation the bill is in line with last years budget summit agreement three major programs that were expanded this year include the women infants and children nutrition program the food safety inspection service and tie food and drug administration first the wic program has been increased by nearly 127 million for fiscal year 1989 above the 1988 level and is more than 52 million above the presidents request this program has proven itself over and over again as one of the most effective methods of inprovlng our nations future citizens health and prosperity unfortunately funding limitations have prevented us from being able to serve even half of those eligible for the program wic is not the only nutrition program other nutrition programs help disseminate information vital to our citizens health through the human nutrition information service and send food for peace to africa asia south america and other regions of the world where there is a shortage of food we have provided funds to help serve nutritious meals for both the young and the elderly of the united states through programs like the school lunch program and the elderly feeding programs under title iii of the older americans act of 1965 second the food safety and inspection service has been increased by more than 12 9 million above fiscal year 1988 to 404 954 000 this is a vital program to assure that americans have meat and poultry products that are wholesome unadulterated and properly labeled and packaged while americans enjoy a nutritious abundant food supply we must be ever vigilant to ensure that our meat and poultry products are the best and safest possible third the food and drug administrations appropriation las been increased by more than 31 million to 481 844 000 for fiscal year 1989 the primary goal of the fda is to protect the consumer by setting standards on food testing drug safety conducting research on health hazards and helping to promote orphan drug development although may important issues are addressed in this bill none is more vital than providing assistance to our farmers and ranchers agriculture has been and will continue to be the backbone of americas economic military and political strength unfortunately the backbone of america has lost over 261 000 farmers and ranchers or 11 percent of the farm population since 1981 on the other hand you and i have both heard how much better off our agricultural producers were in 1987 the united states had record net cash farm income totalling 57 billion in 1987 compared to 52 billion in 1986 and 47 3 billion in 1985 estimates for 1988 earlier this year indicated an income in the 50 to 55 billion range but that was before the drought began to take affect and this level cannot be sustained and will fall in 1988 but for now the good news is that the ccc needs only 8 8 billion to restore prior years lossesa substantial drop from 14 3 billion of a year agoanother positive sign of the improvement in the agricultural economy last year also dramatic increased exports are helping to reduce total spending on agriculture the number of farm workers in the civilian labor force is 2 75 million s of april 1988 when added to the 20plus million workers who support the production and delivery of food and fiber to our citizens you have the largest single industry in the united states agriculture employs as many workers as the transportation steel and automobile industries combined one of the reasons our country has been able to achieve so much is so little of our family income is used to buy food in fact our families spend the smallest percent of their income for food than families in any other country in the world only 12 3 percent for all food and 7 9 percent for food purchased for use at home for every dollar spent on food last year only 25 cents went to the producer while athome expenditures for food averaged a 31 cents return to the farm away from home food purchases only returned 17 cents this clearly indicates consumers ability and willingness to spend more for food for conv ience and in conjunction with entertainment the annual percentage change in

times that we disagreed on certain aspects of proposed legislation or on major national issues but we always were able to go into depth on these matters without being unusually disagreeable trent

done considerable damage along the gulf coast trent jack edwards and i along with a couple of our staffers were flown down by the air force to survey the damage with the ideal of getting federal

the national oceanic and atmospheric administration act of s 1667 authorizes noaas programs to operate and modernize the national weather service conduct research on atmospheric processes involved in ozone depletion and global climate change operate weather and environmental satellites and manage environmental data archivesthe bill authorizes almost 770 million in fiscal year 1988 for noaas atmospheric and satellite programs this is 79 million below the senatepassed level and is roughly equal to the amount contained in the house version of h r 2763 the appropriations bill approved by the house on july 1 by a margin of 292 to 102 for fiscal year 1989 the bill authorizes 870 million which is 146 million less than the senatepassed version the 1989 level recommended by the committee includes the administrations planned weather and satellite procurements and a 4percent inflation increase i want to take a few moments to address the administrations opposition to this bill few members of this body have been more supportive of the administration than i however i believe the administration is wrong on the three points of objection it has raised the administrations first objection states that the bill authorizes 40 7 million more in fiscal year 1988 than was requested actually the committee recommends an increase of 11 9 million above the request as follows there is plus 2 3 million for landsat 4 and 5 and advanced system studies both landsat 4 and 5 are operating beyond their designed lifetime but continue to provide data to users through eosat the additional 23 million provided by the committee in fiscal year 1988 will assure continued operation of the system through the fiscal year as well as provide additional funds to begin development of a muchneeded advanced technology civil earth remote sensing satellite there is plus 6 7 million for severe storm research these additional funds maintain this important research at the fiscal year 1987 level aimed at a wide variety of activities including industry and agriculture and protecting the lives and property of our citizens there is in this bill plus 1 7 million for fire weather agriculture weather and fruit frost warnings these consist of daily forecasts for fire danger rating computations spot forecasts for wildfires and onsite mobile units for large fires within national parklands they include observations forecasts warnings and advisories and issuing of warnings of low temperatures that are especially important in citrusfruitgrowing areas these are services central to the mission of the national weather service and should be maintained finally plus 1 2 million for climate forecast centers these funds are necessary to maintain the current centers these centers are an important link that bring together federal state and private institutions to produce and disseminate climate data and information the committee intends that these climate forecast centers continue and that access to climate data and products be maintained the administrations second objection is that the bill would prematurely authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1989 i cannot agree with this the committee on science space and technology is very familiar with the programmatic and funding needs of noaa for fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 and these are covered in this bill there is no need for either the committee or the house to devote additional time to noaas fiscal year 1989 authorization finally the administration objects that the bill would impose restrictions on the department of commerces ability to manage effectively the national weather service through closings or consolidations of offices all the bill requires is certification from the secretary of commerce prior to any closing consolidation automation or relocation of any weather service office this provision does not in any way hinder the secretary from taking such actions but only that congress be notified in advance it should be noted that the national weather service has proposed to close 7 offices and reduced staffing in 21 other offices in each of the last 3 years without success because of congressional actions by establishing a procedure for such closings or consolidations the committee has improved rather than hindered the departments ability to manage the national weather service in summary i cannot agree with any of the administrations objections to s 1667 i want to reaffirm my strong support for the bill and i urge my colleagues to vote for it"], [0.9689497947692871, 0.9689497947692871, 0, "i thank

agreement issues surrounding american foreign policy in central america and nicaragua in particular have generated a significant public debate throughout the country it has also had the unfortunate effect to date of causing an unhealthy partisan cleavage in this body when we last considered this question i sought a bipartisan agreement focused on humanitarian assistance one which stressed the necessity of arriving at a peaceful diplomatic resolution of the conflict i was disappointed that this house ultimately voted to ban aid of any kind and in the process lost the expedited parliamentary procedure under which it was considered i am pleased however that we have this opportunity to reconsider the issue again so soon this amendment builds on the strengths of the earlier hamilton substitute the emphasis here is on the provision of humanitarian assistance to the contras and the vigorous pursuit of economic and diplomatic measures under the aegis of the contadora process to help secure regional stability by prohibiting the department of defense or the central intelligence agency from distributing the 27 million dollars worth of food clothing and medicine there is little chance that the intention of congress will be misunderstood this amendment further clarifies the role of american intelligence agencies by permitting solely the sharing of intelligence information this provision emphasizes the humanitarian character of american assistance to the contras and the intention of the united states to support a negotiated settlement among the states of the region as well as a churchmediated solution to nicaraguas domestic problems the michel amendment provides that if the president determines that negotiations based on the contadora process have failed to alleviate regional tensions or if other forms of economic suasion have proven to be insufficient then he can request additional assistance for the contras under expedited procedures conversely if the contadora process and other measures yield results beneficial to peace and stability in central america the president may request funding in furtherance of the peace process also under an expedited process these are important signals to the government in managua congress will also monitor the general progress of human rights in nicaragua by requiring the president to provide an analysis of alleged violations of human rights on both sides of the conflict many of us have been concerned not only by the human rights violations of the sandinista government but also by allegations of atrocities committed by those seeking to democratize nicaragua this provision will send a signal to both sides that the united states cannot condone the abuse of civil liberties and will not ignore the senseless loss of civilian lives this framework was absent from our previous consideration of this issue i believe it significantly strengthens the proposal this amendment is an attempt to bridge the partisan gap that has developed over our policy in the region i further believe that this is a proposal which the president can and will support i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the

this special order and permit those of us who had the pleasure and great pleasure of serving with john grotberg an opportunity to speak to the record for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings bonds sales in 1986 are a true tribute to him it has been an honor to have served with

reminded that events in the soviet union are of profound importance to every american and indeed the future prospects for peace and freedom in the world depend to an important extent on what happens in the soviet union history teaches that a government which is not at peace with its own people will not be at peace with other countries that is the issue at stake today and that is why house resolution 455 makes absolutely clear that there is an inherent link between respect for human rights and the achievement of lasting peace the best indication of how serious and credible the kremlin truly is in all of its professions of desire for world peace will be found by looking at how these same men treat their own citizens this resolution declares that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the soviet union is an essential factor needed to improve relations between our two countries and it goes on to emphasize that continued human rights abuses in the soviet union

soviet union were some of the most interesting and important that i have attended in my congressional experience the many witnesses who came before the subcommittee stressed repeatedly the importance

people need to seek a redress of their grievances if they cannot leave an intolerable and repressive society then they are caught in the worst situation imaginable congress has always placed a high priority on the rights of people to emigrate think for a moment about the jacksonvanik amendment and this resolution carries on in that same spirit so i urge a unanimous vote on behalf of this

policy of congress as a measure of national security to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the nations children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and

who are doing the school lunch program and the child nutrition program back in the districts of august 1987 all of the problems and they recite them year after year after year however they will say then at the end dont change anything because if you have money out there instead of commodities the congress may take that money away from us and they cant take the commodities away that is not the way it happened in 1981 folks they discovered that that was not true at all as a matter of fact they lost commodity money was that not a shock to them all i want to point out is if the american public ever knew the amount of money involved in trying to make these distributions they would rise in outrageouswhateverbecause in many instances you buy and then you store and then you shift to the state and they store and then you shift to the local school district now they cannot take care of 50 pounds of frozen hamburger so they have to send it out someplace to store it then when they want to use it they also have to send it out and have it reprocessed so they can use it so for years and years and years we have been trying to find a way to improve food distribution as someone said in our hearings it does not matter which administration it does not get any better it is getting better now why is it getting better because for the first time in the history the department now has a little competition because you authorized some program where you said you could either take cash or you could have a commodity letter of credit let me talk about commodity letter of credit what could be any better if you want to move surplus commodities or commodities that you think are going to be a glut on the market than a commodity letter of credit why is it so great first it is controlled by the secretary of agriculture they cannot take it and go buy what they want to buy they can only buy what he says they can buy that is one so he takes care of any surpluses or anything he perceives that is going to be a glut on the market second they can buy locally and take that surplus away before it ever becomes a storage item and it does not have to be reprocessed in most instances so you get the best of all worlds there now cash cash is something that has been going on a long time is it not amazing we have one state in this union that does this totally different than any other state the state of kansas many years ago decided that we are not going to have any distribution program anymore we are going to get rid of that whole mess as a matter of fact we are going to get out of it so what happens well as the good senator said well i think the government then ought to give us cash in lieu of those commodities that we dont want to bother with and somebody over here in the house must have traded something off i do not know and said we will help you get it so the state of kansas gets their bonus commodities and then they get cash for everything elseonly one state but the commodity letter of crediti do not see how you can do a better job of taking care of surplus than having a commodity letter of credit let me say that the bill as it originally came in my estimation did not do anything more than the secretary can presently do however he seemed to think he needed additional authority so i have no problems with that even though as i said i do not think it does anything any different the original bill than what he now has the power to do but i am happy to support the compromise that we have i think it will take care of both the need to improve nutrition on the one hand and on the other hand to take care of the excess commodities that we have you have to understand the program everybody gets the surplus commodities no matter what program you are under you all get the bonus commodities we are really not talking about those we are talking about those that the secretary goes out and purchases and then tries to distribute through a horrible distribution program and sometimes i think the school food services is linked up somehow or other with the distribution peoplethey get in bed together as i sometimes think lobbyists are lobbying from all different angles and representing and probably getting much more money than any of us in the congress of the united states get because i guess they have more accounts let me say that i rise in support of what we have come up with as a compromise i rise in support of h r 1340 the commodities distribution reform act of 1987 this bill which has been under the supervising eye of two committees of jurisdiction contains a good compromise which balances the agricultural removal programs with those of providing a nutritious meal to schoolchildren the elderly and the needy i applaud the committee members and their work in arriving at a bipartisan compromise this substitute contains not only improvements to the commodity distribution system but contains an extension of the current existing cash and cloc programs for years we have heard the continuous complaints and chronic problems about the distribution system involved in getting foods to the local recipient our intent in this substitute is to grant the department of agriculture the statutory authority which they believe they do not have and yet need to improve the program we therefore are not only giving them this authority but are giving them a mandate to use that authority in a timely manner we are serious about these changes we have relaxed the time lines in order to allow for meaningful comment to regulations which we expect the department to implement maximum public comment will ensure the best promulgated regulations there exists a vital link between the state and federal agencies we expect states as we expect the department to make reforms each state should make complementary reforms so that we can proceed knowing all has been done to make a complicated program work better an important aspect of this bill is the pilot project extension even though we commend the department for recent changes to improve the program i believe the pilots should be given credit for the serious reform of the commodity distribution program taken recently by the department the competition of alternatives is forcing the department to perform better these programs are not designed to dismantle the commodity removal programs but are alternatives to the current distribution method of those commodities available the bottom line is still removal no matter the method then using the surplus to feed people since the current commodity distribution program applies to everyone except the 64 pilots and the state of kansas it has the greatest impact on the most number of youngsters therefore we intend the commodity program to work and work well however if the interested groups including the department do not greatly improve the program with these legislative changes i am reserving the right to revisit offering the cloc option to all local agencies again i rise in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to join me in support of its passage i would like to engage in a little colloquy very quickly if we could have it with the gentleman from california"], [0.00045186281204223633, 0.49954813718795776, 0, "ih r 2213 furthers the national policy of universal telephone service particularly for citizens

legislation that addresses a real problem in this nation we have accomplished it in an effective manner that takes into account the needs of the affected industries and of the public needless to say this is frequently a difficult task the bill before us will accomplish a great deal it will ultimately provide the hearing impaired with the same access to nearly every telephone injoyed by the rest of the public that is and should be an important public policy objective the testimony heard by the telecommunications subcommittee during our hearing on h r 2213 in february suggested that some kinds of telephones should be exempted from the bills reach h r 2213 exempts many kinds of telephone services such as land mobile and cellular radio in which h9aring aid compatibility is not now possible to achieve economically the bill also creates a technology exception through which new telephone services can grow until it is possible to make them compatible with hearing aid technology in a costeffective way h r 2213 also ensures that the development of new telephone services and of new hearing aid technology will be stimulated riot stifled in the emerging information age full
