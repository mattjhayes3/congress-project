in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [0.0013575610937550664, 0.0013575610937550664, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me i rise in strong support of this rule as well as strong support of this historic legislation the social security and medicare safe deposit box act of 1999 how many of us over the last 30 years and i have only been in the house and had the privilege of serving here for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"], [0.0015173436840996146, 0.0015173436840996146, 0, "this is a great opportunity this evening to talk about an issue that many of us haye raised in this congress over the last several years that is an issue that really is a fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on ways and means on wednesday will do it is the goal of the house to act and approve and send to the senate by february 14 valentines day our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty think about it what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working people than elimination of the marriage tax penalty this legislation will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost everybody who suffers it that will be a big change in our tax code the legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the house in the next couple of weeks will help 28 million married working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married working couples elimination of the marriage tax penalty i am joined by a number of my colleagues today who have been real leaders in the effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty as i pointed out earlier of the 435 members of this house we need 217 to pass a bill so an overwhelming majority of the house have joined in cosponsoring this bill i am joined today by a number of cosponsors of this legislation who have stepped forward and fought hard to eliminate the marriage tax penalty at this time i would like to yield to the

primary topics one closely related to the second that first topic is trying to eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"], [0.0016927719116210938, 0.9983072280883789, 1, "i wish to congratulate the gentleman from south carolina for this motion i rise to endorse it and ask my colleagues to accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller classes greater accountability and modem schools and pay down the national debt these are the policies that invest in our children and in the future of our nation in the 21st

that is the problem that we have in our country and also in dealing in congress with the issue of illegal narcotics and the tremendous impact that illegal narcotics are having on our young people tonight i am going to focus a little bit on some of the issues that relate to the question of the district of columbias appropriation and some specific measures that are in the appropriations bill that deal with the district of columbia i also intend to talk a bit about the general war on drugs and review a little bit how we got ourselves into that situation time permitting i also hope to talk some about colombia and the administrations potential request which certainly will dramatically affect our spending as soon as we finish with the problems we have now in funding the fiscal year 19992000 requirements we are expecting a rather substantial request to come in by the administration and we will talk about that and colombia and how we got ourselves into that particular dilemma and i will also talk a bit about the situation in panama that whole region that has been such an active area as far as illegal narcotics trafficking and disruption in general for the entire hemisphere so those are a few subjects and then time permitting i will get into some of the updates that i usually try to do on problems relating to illegal narcotics and how they affect all our communities across the land the first thing that i want to talk about tonight is something that i hear repeatedly over and over that the war on drugs has failed that indeed we have lost the war on drugs i have some very good friends even on the conservative side and i noticed one of the columnists who is very conservative in his opinion this past week came out and said why not legalize narcotics that the war on drugs is a failure i always try to relate my topic of discussion to the facts and deal with the facts and statistics information that we have had presented to us in the subcommittee which i chair which is the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of the committee on government reform we have had many many hearings since i have taken that subcommittee h10852 cc over the beginning of the year dealing with illegal narcotics and we have looked at the question of whether or not the war on drugs is indeed a failure we have looked at the question of legalization in fact we probably conducted the first hearing the only hearing to date on the question of legalization and decriminalization of drug penalties we have talked in our subcommittee and held hearings on the problems wvith mexico with colombia with some of our treatment programs and most recently the education program that this congress has funded to the tune of a billion dollars over the next 5 years getting an update on that first years progress in that program additionally the southwest border and the billions of dollars we spent in federal resources at that border in trying to contain not only illegal narcotics but illegal immigration and trafficking illegal commerce across our borders so we have covered the gamut of this topic we have heard from gao dea department of justice department of defense department of state many many agencies of federal government and rely on their facts and support and statistics in our reports basically i came to the conclusion and i think my colleagues would too if they spent time in those hearings as we have done we came to the conclusion that in fact the war on drugs did not fail what happened was we had an end of the war on drugs in 1993 with the clinz ton administration which took over not only the executive branch of government which executes the law but also had very substantial majorities in both the house of representatives and also the other body the united states senate they controlled and dominated the agenda the legislative agenda and the executive and administrative operations of this government for over 2 years from 1993 through 1995 i have had these charts out before and i will refer to them once again foremost in our responsibility as a federal government are our programs to stop illegal narcotics at their squrce outside the country now state and local governments law enforcement folks cannot do that but it certainly must be done and whether we legalize what are now illegal narcotics or not we would still have a fundamental responsibility in keeping what would be an illegal commodity coming into the united states in this case it happens to be primarily heroin cocaine and methamphetamines the first thing that the clinton administration did after completely decimating the drug czars office and that was the beginning of the ending of the war on drugs they took the drug czars office down from a staffing level of over 120 to some less than 2 dozen personnel that was the first cut slash burn that ended the war on drugs"], [0.0017320218030363321, 0.0017320218030363321, 0, "committee of conference

instructions when the republican party became the majority party in 1995 congress began enacting a series of commonsense reforms these reforms have changed the way the federal government operates and have saved billions of taxpayer dollars one of the first things congress did was apply all laws that it passes to itself previously congress would pass burdensome regulations on the private sector but exclude itself from compliance to these laws in 1995 congress passed the paperwork reduction act to identify and reduce burdensome federal paperwork requirements on the private sector especially small businesses continuing toward a goal of creating a 21st century government in 1996 congress passed the federal acquisition reform act to reduce bureaucratic requirements within the federal procurement system we have all heard examples of inflated prices like the 187 screw sets purchased by the government for 75 60 each more often than not such fleecing of taxpayer dollars is due to the cumbersome federal procurement system not fraud the federal acquisition reform act has streamlined the process of doing business with the federal government by significantly reducing such waste in 1997 congress passed the travel and transportation reform act legislation to remedy poor management of the federal governments massive travel expenditures this bill is now law and has led to a concerted effort by federal managers to improve the federal travel efficiency and cost effectiveness the congressional budget office estimates savings of 80 million per year with the passage last year of the presidential and executive office financial accountability act congress created a chief financial officer for the white house this nonpartisan cfo position in the executive office of the president will facilitate prevention and early detection of waste fraud and abuse accordingly the bill promotes efficiency and cost reductions within the white house today congress takes another step toward increasing efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars with consideration of the government waste corrections act in private industry companies routinely audit themselves to determine if they have overpaid vendors and suppliers overpayments are a fact of life for businesses government entities and even our own households overpayments become more likely with larger volumes of payments overpayments occur for a variety of reasons including duplicate payments pricing errors and missed discounts or rebates on average private industry recovers 1 million for each 1 billion that is audited overpayments at the federal level are an especially serious problem when considering the size and complexity of federal operations as well as the widespread financial management weaknesses of the federal government recovery auditing and activity already occurs in limited areas of the federal government recovery audits of the department of defense alone have identified errors averaging 4 percent of federal payments audited or 4 million out of every 1 billion recovery efforts throughout the entire federal government could save billions of dollars more with this in mind the government waste corrections act requires federal agencies to perform audits if their direct purchases for goods and services total 500 million or more per fiscal year agencies that must undertake recovery auditing would also be required to institute a management improvement program to address underlying problems of their payment systems the government waste corrections act is a commonsense government reform that incorporates proven moneysaving private sector practices to the federal government i encourage all members to support the rule and the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"],

opposition to the amendment i have to apologize to our colleagues that we are taking up the time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take to the voters the

comment on the colloquy that we just heard with respect to regional differences in the fluid milk dairy prices and i would like to recite for this house what the history of this matter is since 1937 we have been operating under an outmoded system of milk marketing orders which mandates by law that certain farmers in certain regions of the country be paid more for their milk than are farmers from other sections of the country that is a federal law believe it or not and it has long since served its usefulness when the farm bill was up on the floor 4 years ago thencongressman gunderson the chairman of the dairy subcommittee tried to get a legislative remedy to that long outmoded policy and when he did that he was blocked cut off at the pass by the house leadership the republican leadership in the form of the speaker and mr solomon who chaired the committee on rules in essence what they told steve at the time was sorry we are not going to give you a chance to vote on a legislative remedy the best you are going to get is that we will give the secretary of agriculture an opportunity to look at these milk marketing orders and decide through administrative action what kind of changes are needed acting under that limited authority secretary glickman proposed what was known as option ib which provided very minimal changes in the milk marketing order system across the country that was found to be objectionable by many members of this house certainly not me but by many other members and so this house last year passed legislation which blocked the secretary from moving ahead with those changes those reforms in the milk marketing order system so then mr glickman went back to the drawing board and he produced a second modified version of his proposal which would have provided some change some modernization in that system and it would have resulted in farmers in 15 of the 33 regions actually getting better prices for their milk than they do right now and it would have had a downward pressure on some other regions it just seems to me that it is amazing that the folks who won by preventing us from getting a legislative decision on this issue and who insisted that this ought to be handled through the administrative route are now saying that they are unhappy with even the tiny changes that were made administratively by the secretary and are now suggesting that yet another legislative action is required to selectively amend the farm bill i do not believe that is the right way to go it seems to me strange indeed that in a congress which so often talks about the need to move closer to market arrangements that we are having people who are insisting on sticking to the status quo which blocks moving agriculture in the dairy area closer to market arrangements i also find it interesting that some of the same folks who say that we should have free trade internationally are some of the same folks who when it comes to internal trade within our own country want to put up all kinds of trade barriers informal trade barriers in the form of these regional compacts so i would simply say i cannot do anything about the colloquy that just took place between the members of the majority party all i can say as one member from the upper midwest is that i do not think it is fair for people to try to have this issue both ways we were told that we should take our shot at the administrative route rather than the legislative route that is what happened and now the members at least some of the members who just spoke are now trying to suggest that we ought not to have let that happen either we cannot move agriculture into the 20th century by sticking with this outmoded oldfashioned milk marketing order system and i would suggest if we are going to open this issue up then we ought to open up the whole faim bill that we ought to open up the question of whether we ought to have any milk marketing orders at all we ought to be allowed to vote on
