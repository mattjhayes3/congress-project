offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.038776397705078125, 0.9612236022949219, 1, "mr chairman and my colleagues in the house of representatives we begin now consideration of the first of four budget resolutions made in order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.039835453033447266,

the 1984 los angeles olympic games the rule provides for 2 hours of general debate the time is divided equally between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the first reading of the bill is dispensed with since the report on the bill has not been available for the required 3 days the rule waives clause 2 1 6 of rule xi againd consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing of these commemorative coins was in the judgment of the committee sufficient to move forward with the bill the banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all points of order for violations of clause 5 rule xxi against the committee substitute the amendment and the annunzio substitute each of which contains appropriations language in the section providing for the distribution of funds the rule provides for a motion to reeommit with or without instructions it may seem unusual to consider a rule calling for 2 hours of debate on commemorative legislation however in the committee on rules the gentleman from illinois made an impassioned plea for 1 additional hour of debate in order that he might have ample opportunity to present his case for a different marketing approach to the olympic coins mr annunzio is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage which reported by a 6 to 0 vote a procedure which varies signifi cantly from the procedure adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of time here to a description briefly the legislation managed on the floor by chairman st germain proposes to mint legal tender coins in 17 emblematic designs the coins would be sold through private marketers selected through a process overseen by the treasury department and allowing for competitive bidding a 30 million guarantee to the olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are planning to compete before a worldwide audience that could number in the billions an olympic coin program is important in two respects the tradition of minting special coins can be traced back centuries to the ancient greeks throughout history special coins played a role in generating enthusiasm and support for the games and more recently have helped fund the staging of the games so that countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial support is critical to our ability to provide american youth of all ages and skills the opportunity to develop their athletic ability and to build the pride and confidence important to compete in todays world without an effective olympic coin program for the los angeles games we would lose out on an important source of these funds the legislation we have before us is vitally important i

he did it so well that i thought about this in this sense if you think about a political leaderand i tried to think about somebody as i extend my remarks who talked about the importance of what one person could do and so if you will bear with me for a minutea person who some years ago talked about the futility of being one man and he suggested that if we all gave in and said that we could not make changes in the world because it was futile we should look at martin luther king or we should look at martin luther as a practical matter if we would give in to expediency and say that if that was a cause for us to not want to make changeswe should look at those people who in the expediency of giving in to politics gave in to the camps of dachau and auschwitz and we did not give inmany people did not then you could look at the other danger this person said and we could give in to the concerns of temerity and say that many of us did not wish to be laughed at and so we would not take a chance and risk the temerity or take the temerity and risk the chance of being laughed at by our colleagues and the other great danger this colleague of ours of some years back said was the risk of comfort which toby did not have tony did not have the comfort of an education paid for by his parents or toby did not have the comfort of a great deal of outside income and many people could use that comfort to not take a chance if you have a great deal of education a great deal of income you do not have to risk fighting so as our friend said the futility the expediency the temerity the comfort all those things could deny one person from trying to change the course of the world and if you did not risk greatly you could not achieve greatly now the person who said that and i wish it could have been me was a person who i am sure both toby and i admire it was robert kennedy when he finished his book in march of 1968 and he wrote those words in los angeles just before he was assassinated but i think back on it and i think that those apply to toby who was willing to risk greatly to achieve greatly we will miss him those of us who may not risk as greatly as we would like he did achieve greatly and i think that will go on his record and i think we will all admire him for that in addition to that we will miss him as a friend we will miss his wife myra and little mary ellen i expect

budget we were spending about 184 billion that was about 12 years ago but the interesting thing was that with a balanced budget the country only had 3 percent unemployment well now we are spending 750 billion and we have about 10 percent unemployment and what happened is that as congress puts more and more of the nations money into the government operations we have less and less capital money available for private enterprise to create jobs what america needs today is to let more money go into private business private enterprise to create more jobs for america and the way you can do that is when america has a balanced budget balancing the budget is the most essential the top priority that faces congress today i stand in strong support of the balanced budget amendment the congress has been unable to discipline itself and its spending habits over the last 20 years as evidenced by the fact that we have not come close to a balanced budget since 1969 the federal budget has been balanced twice since 1960 and during that time our deficits have accumulated to an amount equaling half our national debt which has exploded over 1 trillion it is clear that the current budget process is inadeqaute to keep the congress from spending this country into bankruptcy the american people are tired of reckless federal policy that deflates their dollars and causes their interest rates to soar people in texas see that federal spending rose from 92 billion in fiscal year 1960 to projected outlays of 769 8 billion in fiscal year 1983 the jump in federal outlays between 1970 and 1980 alone amounted to an increase of 194 7 percent in my travel around texas people tell me they are tired of working for the government from januarythrough june just to pay their taxes it is time to balance the budgetthe way to do it is house joint resolution let us talk about why we need the balanced budget amendment house joint resolution 350 does two things first it requires a balanced budgetcongress cannot engage in deficit spending unless threefifths of both houses agree to a specific excess of outlays over receipts second the amendment controls the growth of federal spending by requiring that outlays not exceed receipts the heritage foundation describes the effects of the lack of a spending limitation on congress in the following way without a spending limitation mlembers of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political c6sts of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation if the debt is monetized huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congressmen who support it by the time the negative effects are visible it is possible that those responsible for the harm may have already left office a similar process occurs through the progressive tax structure because inflation and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase we need the discipline of the balanced budget amendment because of what budget deficits are going to average americans for instance uncontrolled spending and giveaways has driven food stamp outlays up almost 20 000 percent from 1970 to 1983 hud subsidized housing outlays increased over 1 517 percent in the same period federal outlays soared from 195 7 billion in 1970 to 731 billion this year those outlays increased over 10 percent in the last year alone look at what this spending has done to the deficitwhich drives up interest rates as the government borrows money in private markets to finance its overspending the deficit has zoomed from 2 8 billion in 1970 to over 100 billion this year continual spending has driven the united states debt from 382 6 billion in 1970 to 1 1 trillion today the debt increased 139 percent between 1970 and 1980 alone and was up 13 3 percent this year from last taxes have also gone up to the point of breaking americans backs to finance the freespending congress individual federal income taxes increased from 90 4 billion in 1970 to 244 billion in 1980 and will be 298 6 billion this year total taxescapital taken out of productive usehave grown from 192 6 billion in 1970 to 631 7 billion this year people have had it and are ready for this congress to rein itself in so they can continue to make ends meet to say nothing of pursing the american dream let us look at what free spending in congress has done to the financial po ition of average americans the tax burden on individuals and families has grown out of control to finance the federal budget the twowage earner family of four with a median income has seen their tax liability more than double from 1 074 in 1970 to 2 717 this year those taxes increased 133 7 percent between 1970 and 1980 alone the president brought taxes down for the first time in years this yearby 4 2 percentin his administrations attempt to bring this country back to economic health interest rates which are driven up by hugh federal deficits are killing people homeowners farmers small businessmeneveryone interest rates are kept high as the government goes into the capital markets to finance itself and then has to go back to the markets for money to pay its interest on the gigantic debt it continues to pile up and saddle on the american people interest rates rose from 6 w percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 the presidents economic recovery is beginning to cause the rates to moderatethey stand around 13 percent and must still be brought down during the freespending years of the 1970s interest rates went up 150 percent they are down 37 2 percent from last year however as we begin to turn the trend toward big government around high interest rates have just about killed average homeowners and made it nearly impossible for young people to buy a home in 1970 when rates were around 8 percent the monthly mortgage payment on a 21 000 loan was only 169 00 by 1980 interest rates had soared to 12 5 percent with such a rate a 48 400 loan now required to buy a priceinflated home resulted in a monthly mortgage payment of 523 69 for 26 years this year that mortgage payment would have been 615 a month we must control spending with a balanced budget amendment to bring these rates down permanently farmers too have been hard hit by interest rates caused by congressional red ink they cannot afford to purchase equipment buy

think it is time to put the social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax

cannot carry on the 747 the c17 argument calculates that you can figure on building a cheaper airplane on time and on schedule let me suggest that there are three lessons from the falkland islands that shatter both the c17 and the boeing 747 argument first you want to win early and with as much force as possible you want to win decisively that means you want to deliver combat loaded equipment that rolls off and goes into battle you do not want to pull up and start assembling second you cannot be sure where trouble is coming no one in britain expected a war in the south atlantic no one in the united states can predict where we ought to prestock equipment and i dare say when you talk about cost if the 747 advocates would count in the cost of all the equipment they intend to prestock in all the places we have interests they would find their costs 10 or 20 times greater than the c5 third ultimately you fight with what you have when the battla starts the fact is that paper airplanes do not help you at all in this context let us look at our choices the c17 is a paper airplane every promise that has been made about delivery dates and cost of the c17 is just that a promise in fact

justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and international perspective of recognizing raoul wallenberg in this unique way for the unprecedented things he did at our request"], [0.9070199728012085, 0.9070199728012085, 0, "i support the conference report on house joint resolution 599 which continues appropriations for the 1983 fiscal year your conferees

substantive legislation but were given to us because the basic legislation has not been enacted some of these issues are within the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means i hope my colleagues on that committee will recognize that we did not initiate or seek these issues they were thrust upon us personally i am not at all confortable dealing with issues such as steel import licenses and the

reason to resolve highly controversial issues congress will find some other way which is usually appropriation bills we are not shopping for problems but we cannot avoid them once the house or the senate amends one of our bills the termination date of the resolution is december 17 which was a simple compromise with no special significance between the house date of december 15 and the senate

coffee agreement we provide that 75 percent of mass transit funds shall be apportioned using 1980 census data and 25 percent will be based on 1970 census data the senate amendment would have required that all funds be apportioned using the 1980 figures senate language which provides for payments to air traffic controllers is reported in disagreement but i support the senate language and will

americans act amendments the life expectancy of americans continues to grow and so correspondingly does the senior population the growing numbers and proportions of seniors is certainly a triumph for our nation it reflects the improved quality of life in america and allows it to continue to improve by using the knowledge and experience of our senior citizens as one of our greatest assets we can expect great demographic changes by the end of this century as the nations senior population becomes a greater percentage of the population as a whole the older americans act was originally established in 1965 to meet the needs of the elderly community for community and social services our vote to reauthorize the older americans act reaffirms this nations high sense of responsibility toward the wellbeing of the growing senior population the needs of the elderly are generaliy different from those of the rest of the population and within the category elderly there are people with specific needssome who are basically healthy and able and others who are frail and dependent the older american act addresses the needs of the entire elderly population because of the wide range of services which states may provide with funds authorized by this act the older americans act has been very successful in its purpose of improving the quality of life for our citizens in the areas of income housing health employment and community services the amendments of 1981 include some changes which will make it easier to achieve these goals title v provides senior citizens with the opportunity to be employed in the community service if they desire to work and supplement their income the 1981 amendments also include weatherization activities as an appropriate community service in my home state of maine there are many citizens particularly the elderly whose homes are not energy efficient but who cannot physically manage to make such improvements to their homes the winters in maine are verycold and these people continue to spend an increasing portion of their limited incomes on energy with the reduction in funds this year for weatherization programs i was pleased to see the community services employment program granted the option of placing ablebodied seniors in jobs where they can help other senior citizens fix up their homes and save money on heating bills an other important improvement to the older americans act will help communities to transport senior citizens to congregate meal programs authorized under title iii for years the area agencies on aging in maine have asked me about the possibility of using a portion of the funding under title iiic for transportation to the meal sites maine is a very rural state and many or our elderly are isolated the 1981 amendments will allow the use of contributions for meals to be used to pay some of the cost of a transportation network to bring seniors to the meal sites in addition to the many important services reauthorized under this act there is also an extension of the plder americans volunteer programs administered by the action agency these include foster grandparents senior companions and the retired senior volunteer progium rsvp this year marks the 10th anniversary of rsvp these senior citizens volunteer their time to provide services which cover a wide range of community needs including energy conservation housing health nutrition and education these volunteer programs have been very successful in involving seniors in many different projects that help their local communities our vote to reauthorize the older americans act will allow the volunteer programs to continue their good work the older americans act gives senior citizens a number of avenues through which to help each other the program is very cost effective because it allows many of the frail elderly to remain in their own homes by receiving help through the homemaker and home companion services provided in this act it provides the elderly with meaningful work during their retirement years and demonstrates that we value their experience and kniowledge a vote to reauthorize the older americans act is one to confirm
