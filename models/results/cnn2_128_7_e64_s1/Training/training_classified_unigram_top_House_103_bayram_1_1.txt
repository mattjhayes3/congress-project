this proposal at the same time i must voice my very strong concerns regarding the use of the discharge petition to advance legislative objectives i wish this bill had come to the floor under the regular legislative process the discharge petition is an antidemocratic tool it should be used only in circumstances when the regular legislative process has been blocked and frustrated thats not the case with this bill the bill was introduced for the very first time in march of this year the discharge petition was filed in may i believe the public has a right to know who has signed petitions to discharge committees from consideration of legislation i frankly believe constituents have a right to ask whether their representative has signed a petition under those circumstances i cant believe most members would refuse to answer i have never signed a discharge petition and i hope i will never need to sign one i hope my colleagues will not see the passage of this proposal as an opportunity to expand the use of the discharge petition as a substitute for normal legislative procedures the discharge petition does violence to the legislative process the fundamental philosophical basis for our federal system is that government should act only aftercareful deliberation the entire structure of our governmentthe division of authority and responsibility among legislative executive and judicial branches the further division of the legislative branch into two houses the protections of the rights of the states and the individualis summed up in the words checks and balances the idea is to prevent hasty illconsidered actions even when they have strong popular support the proponents of this legislation have made arguments that betray an ignorance of and a lack of respect for the workings of a representative legislative body some have argued that members who cosponsor legislation but refuse to sign a discharge petition do so to deceive their constituents but surely every member must understand the difference between cosponsoring a bill and seeking its immediate consideration on the floor when members cosponsor legislation it expresses interest in the issue and support for the proposal but to do our work here we rely on a public hearing process at which concerned americans have the chance to come forward and tell us what they think of the proposal congress is engaged in making public policy for this process to succeed the public must have ample opportunity for input the discharge petition far from being a means to achieve open government and democracy undermines the opportunity for the people to participate in the writing of the laws we pass the discharge petition effectively shuts the american people out of the process after the sponsoring member has introduced the bill theres no hearings no amendments no possibility to accommodate concerns that the sponsor may not have considered so let us make the signatures public we must do so to reduce the degree of cynicism and suspicion regarding the actions we take here in the peoples house regrettably some of the champions of this proposal have seized the issue as a means to drive up public

clarion call to the american peoplea wakeup call as to what is happening to their government down here in washington since they voted for a new congress and president just 4 short months ago this week the american people thought they voted for change they thought they voted to take back their government they thought they voted to restore democracy and put the people back in control of the peoples house well i have sad news to announce to the american people today if you want to know what the score here is in the peoples house let me put it in the simplest terms i can here is todays democracy box score the people zero tyranny five yes you heard me right the people are down five to zero in their own house thats a shut out in any game you play only we are not supposed to be playing games here we are supposed to be legislating for the people and the good of the nation nevertheless the people are being shutout in their own house for the fifth straight time in this congress this is the fifth restrictive rule out of five rules granted in which amendments have been severely limited if not denied altogether prior to this hatch act bill the rules committee granted restrictive rules onthe family and medical leave bill on which only three amendments were allowed the motorvoter bill on which just one amendment was allowed the family planning bill on which just one amendment was allowed and the unemployment compensation bill on which no amendments were allowed and now today on this federal employees political activities act we have made in order just three amendments even though a total of nine amendments were submitted to the rules committee not only did the rules committee deny representative wolf of virginia an opportunity to offer all four of the amendments he had submitted it also denied one of its own majority democrats mr fogitwra of pennsylvania his amendment in the rules committee yesterday we offered an open rule and all but one democrat voted against that motion that same democrat mr beilenson voted with us to make the four wolf amendments in order the foglietta amendment went down on a partyline votesandbagged by his own fellow democrats following my remarks i will include a summary of each of the amendments denied and the rollcall vote on those amendments as well as the text of our open rule and the rollcall vote on it why are thepeople the real losers in this the reason is very simple every time we deny an open amendment process on an important piece of legislation we are disenfranchising the people and their representatives from the legislative process the people and their representatives are not even being treated as secondclass citizens they might as well not be citizens at all given how little impact they have on shaping legislation in the house if that is not undemocratic i would like to know what is the opposite of democracy is tyrannyand that is precisely what is at work in this house of representatives today is the word tyranny too strong for some of my colleagues do you think it cannot happen here well you need look no further than jeffersons manual or the federalist papers to know that one of the things the founders mostfeared was a tyranny of the majority jefferson observed that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of administration and those who acted with the majority than a neglect of or departure from the rules of proceeding which were designed as a shelter and protection to the minority against the attempts of power and jefferson went on to warn that these rules of proceeding are the only weapons the minority has to defend itself against those irregularities and abuses which these forms were intended to check and which the wantonness of power is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities in other words the further you and your leadership stray from the regular order around here the more you are instituting a new order which is not democracy by any definition it is a new oligarchy and tyranny which will some day cause the people to topple this house if we dont bring it down on ourselves first if you want to talk about term limits you are well on your way to selfimposing one on yourself whether you like it or not the people are sick and tired of this political gamesmanship they want back into their own house and they want it open and democratic notclosed and dictatorial i have not spoken to the merits of the bill this rule makes in order because i happen to favor this bill but that is not what is at issue here if it is a good bill as i think it is it should be able to withstand the scrutiny and debate that comes through an open amendment process i suggested one amendment in the rules committee which i think would further improve the legislation as far as state employees who receive federal funds it would have allowed them to run for any office but that was denied finally to add insult to outrage the rules committee recon vened late yesterday afternoon to further amend this rule by waiving all points of order against the bill and against its consideration it seems the bill creates a new entitlement program and thereby violates at least three provisions of the congressional budget act we have no letter from the budget committee chairman supporting or opposing these waivers but that did not stop the rules committee from throwing the budget act out the window let me say in conclusion that we will once again give a majority of this house an opportunity to strike a blow for democracy and openness by voting down the previous question so that we can offer an open rule let us start to turn that democracy box score around and put the people back in the winning column vote no

billion from federal spending it is notable that the republican altemative cuts spending by 141 billion less than this reconciliation bill does the democratic party is clearly the party that truly cares about cutting deficit spending and is willing to move forward with real deficit reduction president clinton has changed the debate in this country from whether we would ever reduce the deficit to how we will reduce the deficit it is certain to me that we will pass a budget reconciliation bill which implements the presidents budget and actually reduces the deficit by approximately 500 billion in the next 5 years what is at issue today therefore is not whether we will pass the bill but what goes into the package we have taken the presidents proposal which contained many good provisions and made it better we have extended the payasyougo provisions of the 1990 budget agreement which requires that any new spending must be paid for through cuts in other spending or in new taxes we have included the presidents deficit reduction trust fund to guarantee that all taxes raised in this package will actually reduce the deficit and cannot be used to pay for new spending programs the 5year fibeze on discretionary spending in the budget is a first and puts congress on record that it will not allow optional spending to rise i worked hard in the budget committee to freeze discretionary spending and applaud the corrmittee chairman for working with us to accomplish this that measure alone will save americans almost 90 billion over the next 5 years late last night this legislation was improved further we were able to push through needed revisions that help control entitlement or mandatory spending are these limits on uncontrolled increases in entitlement spending enough no i urge the congress to adopt comprehensive budget process reform similar to what i have proposed in h r 1138 but these controls do for the first time limit growth in the largest and fastest growing part of our budget we cannot abdicate our responsibility in this area as we have up until now without dealing with mandatory spending we cannot control the deficit i thank the white house and the leadership for recognizing this need and for addressing it in this bill it helps meet our commitment to the american people to get federal spending under control without such a measure runaway entitlement spending could add as much as 200 billion extra to the federal debt over the next 5 years i am therefore positive about this bill in many ways i do have concerns over whats in the bill however and will vote against it due to its inclusion of the energy and social security tax increases the btu tax is a left jab to the chin of middleincome americans and the tax increase in social security is an uppercut to the midsection of the elderly it strikes especially hard at energyproducing states like my own state of utah even with some exemptions for certain energyrelated purchases this tax will hit farmers persons who drive long distances coal producers and steel producers and their employees in utah i am not willing to subject my district and state to a tax that will hit middleincome americans so directly and will hit my constituents harder than most other districts and states spending cuts must in fact come first the btu tax in particular is almost certain to be removed from the package or significantly altered before final passage the administration and the house leadership have acknowledged that the bill will undergo substantial changes before reaching the presidents desk it is unfortunate that this house was not able to resolve the problems with the energy tax increase in the social security tax and the entitlement cuts prior to sending it on to the

32 votes against funding this year there were 42 votes so the tide in the senate is on our side it makes absolutely no sense for us to proceed with funding for a project when nearly twothirds of the members of the house on both sides of the political aisle have gone on record saying they do not support this project and when 42 members of the other body are clearly saying this year that they do not support further funding either it is time that we follow through on our decision earlier this year and terminate this project i would just point out that this again is the single biggest cut in any appropriation bill that we have adopted this year i do not see how this body or this institution can go home this year and tell the taxpayers of this country that we are serious about cutting spending when we walk away from this opportunity to save the taxpayers at least 10 billion some people might be thinking well 10 billion is not that much money but we have broken this down on a statebystate basis so that taxpayers across this country understand exactly how much of their money is going to be going to this project let me just share with you some of these numbers californias share of this 11 billion projected price and that is going up by the way it has gone up at least another billion dollars and some people say 2 billion but to just be very conservative we will assume a total of 11 billion as the price for this project the california share is about 1 449 billion almost 1 billion of this project will be paid for by california taxpayers florida taxpayers will pay 575 million georgia taxpayers 254 million illinois taxpayers 572 million taxpayers from kansas our share is 103 million for the super collider project massachusetts taxpayers will be asked to contribute 312 million to build the super collider michigan 405 million missouri 202 million new york 940 million of taxpayer money will go to fund the super collider again i am disappointed that in the conference committee we do not have any representation from the 280 members that voted to terminate funding no one on the conference is representing the majority position expressed by more than twothirds on either side of the political aisle that is the reason we need to change the rules of this house to prevent that sort of thing from happening again in the future"], [0.5832626521587372,

partisan issue and this is also not an issue of cutting spending for the department of defense this is a question of whether we are going to increase an appropriation to the department of defense this is not a cut this is an addon increase the facts as the chairman of the armed services committee has pointed out are first the 750 million cost of the somalia operation was identified by the department as being offset by other lowpriority expenditures without an additional appropriation and the additional 450 million was added on at the end for no specificpurpose other than apparently they are taking additional cuts in 1994 through 1998 it seems to me that at a time when the military when the department of defense is contemplating a new provision called dont ask dont tell it seems

that exist on both sides and of the recent history of this issue which has made it more difficult for all of us but i do want to say a few things that are pertinent to this amendment and i want to urge support of the amendment first it is ironic that we have had a couple of days of debate here where the chairman of the committee on public works who is entirely within his rights in terms of the technical rules of the house has gotten up and has argued against the kind of flexibility that many people many of us think has served us well in past years the understanding has been that although we are dealing with a multiyear authorization in transportation matters we need to get some flexibility through the yeartoyear appropriations process e h 6925 we proposed for example that moribund projects totaling 64 million funds just sitting there unused should be rescinded that flexibility was denied us stricken on a point of order members got up in this well time after time to say that the amount of authorized funds in istea was inadequate to complete a project could we not have some flexibility to step up work on an urgent or emergency project we were told that no that flexibility is not available to us now we are being asked by that same chairman for flexibility we are being asked for special consideration for his own project even though on most criteria it would fall short as a matter of fact as you look down the list of transit projects included in this bill this project simply does not pass muster in terms of costeffectiveness ratios in terms of the estimated cost per new trip dallas 9 st louis 9 portland 19 a little high but still 19 chicago 17 houston 4 pittsburgh 5 salt lake city 7 and then you come to san francisco airport 27 per new ride and san jose tasman 40 those are not acceptable ratios now the gentleman from pennsylvania has made a great deal of what appears to be one exception on the list namely the funding for kansas city south which is listed as 50 indeed that is the only one on the list that goes above the san jose tasman figure but i would point out that this is a project that is only now at the alternatives analysis stage and i assure you if the kansas city people want to move on toward preliminary engineering and final design if those numbers are not improved i do not think that project will remain on the list so really we have in tasman a project that does not measure up to the criteria that we have set the criteria that i think most members of this body think we ought to consistently apply to these projects we simply cannot do it all we have got to be harder on ourselves in terms of cost criteria that we impose for that reason this project has quite properly been omitted finally let me say that if the project does have the exceptional merit that has been claimed for it it will be on the list for a fair and open competition because i remind you that mr walkers amendment simply puts this money the money that is stricken into the discretionary account the san francisco airport portion of this in particular might be able to compete effectively for that money and would have the opportunity to do so so we would shift the money to a discretionary account and if this project had the merits claimed for it then it could compete on its merits with projects from all over this great country of ours that seems fair enough and i urge adoption of the amendment m es0o mr cha rman i move to strike the requisite number of werdi mr chatrman i rise in strong oppoaibthin to the walker amendmeet muck was ad y esrday anf again tadat abaut the bay area rapi traimfst amd the tasman lght rail projecta obviously this is caught up in a bouse dis pate and these projects have been in my view much maigned as illconceived poorly planned

have been authoried and appropriated by this house having served in local goveryment for the last decade i worked on the bart extension the theman light ra project a differerrt system is in my congressional district these transportation projects in a part of our nation that is the economic engine are projects that local communities determined to be so important that they chose to tax themselves through an increase in their gas tax in their sales tax and in their bridge tolls in a period of time when other tax proposals across this country in every single members community i would venture to say would have been difficult at the least to pass in most communities would have failed before any federal assistance was requested public hearings were held an election to establish taxes was held and transportation projects were reviewed studied and ranked citizens chose to invest in selfhelp and real localfederalstate partnerships at a time wken county and local governments are competng against each other for every skngle nickel and dime the counties cities and towns of the bay area and all the members of the bay area republeiana and democrats worked together with

very distressing however that the vietnamese govemment continues to persecute its citizens for seeking freedoms that are recognized throughout the world after the conclusion of the second round of

and that was the position of the other body as well we have in effect already decided this issue we should stand by this decision and support the conference report second it is no great secret around here that it is not difficult to vote against the district of columbia the harder vote is to stand up for what is right what is right here is to allow the citizens of the district to make their own decisions about how they want to allocate their tax dollars d c citizens have limited political rights as we all know they do not elect full voting members of the house although we have taken some steps in that direction they do not elect senators but they do elect a mayor and a city council these women and men set the policy for the city they are accountable to their voters as members of congress we are free to disagree with their positions but we must understand that d c voters ask no more than what our own constituents ask indeed demand the right to make their own decisions about how they will be governed third i want to make it perfectly clear that medicaid funds that go to the district are governed by the hyde amendment in the laborhhs bill many members may think this debate is about medicaid funding but it is not it is about preventing the district from using its funds as it chooses in your states in your cities and towns you have large taxpayersnone as large as the federal government but sizable all the same but you do not and we in connecticut do not permit these individuals and taxpayers to dictate the terms on which their tax dollars can be used that is a

us as members of congress and it is the issue i think that has done more to drive a wedge between where we are and the chances of accomplishing meaningful health reform than any other issue in front of us as a congress and the reason is because we those of us here tonight most of the members of congress and most of america understands the importance of small business small business and i borrow from chevrolet but small business is the heartbeat of america that is where our job growth comes from that is where our innovation comes from that is what keeps us on top of the world in so many areas and that is in spiteof this tremendous number of unfunded mandates that the federal government and the state government has continued to lay on top of small business the gentleman from minnesota went into some detail on that but it amazes me what kind of resiliency our business sector has in spite of all we do to it but it has got a strong heart and it has got determination but it cannot continue to take it and it cannot continue to survive with the kind of burden that we continue to shovel on it it is drowning in a sea of red tape these small businesses do not have a room full of lawyers a room full of accountants to figure out this maze of regulations that would come with a mandate that had exceptions and offered all sorts of ways to either qualify or not qualify for the various subsidies associated with it and to expect them to have to live with that kind of regulation and burden is unrealistic people who ask that of them do not understand how hard it is just to keep the doors open and keep e h4647 the business going and that would be the most expensive mandate of all in texas they have estimated we would lose 52 000 jobs if this mandate were put in place the presidents own estimates his economic advisers have said it would lose 600 000 jobs nationwide that is a lot of families who would suffer if this were to be put in place these cumbersome and expensive mandates people wonder why the jobs are going elsewhere why they are going overseas well i say you dont have to look very far with mandates such as these folks just get tired of it and give up and want to make one point is there a particular group that would suffer in this and there is it is the firsttime job seeker the young men the young women right out of high school and college at the beginning of their career they are at their lowest earning capacity that they will have in their entire career they may start out at 12 000 15 000 18 000 a year and perhaps even lower and add the cost of an employer mandate for health care premiums on top of that and it makes them unemployable that is who is going to pay the price here these young people who are struggling who have it as tough as any group of young people have ever had it in the history of this country and we are going to shovel another burden on their back and make it so much more difficult for them to get started i do not think any of us have to be told how hard it is for them to get started today in the current climate without having this 2 000 3 000 or 4 000 cost associated with their first job it is not fair to ask that of them let me just close with a personal anecdote i had a lady come up to me at a bakery that is in my neighbor hood it is a small bakery they have got about 12 employees some part time some full time and she said we are barely getting by right now if this mandate were to be put upon us id close my doors my parents owned this before me we have been a part of this neighborhood my whole life and if this mandate were to come about and when i look at what im able to pay my employees and none of us gets rich not the owners not the ones who work here but if im forced to pay health insurance for these folks we are gone were out of business well be out of business the day that mandate takes hold and becomes a requirement for this little bakery those are the kinds of bakeries and businesses that truly are the heart and soul of our country they are the heartbeat of america it is the american dream and these kinds of mandates without congress considering the consequences are

with violent offenders in ensuring that they serve a substantial portion of their time for second offenders florida has a requirement as the gentleman from florida knows of 75 percent of their time for firsttime violent offenders other states have a variation of that you cannot develop an arbitrary 85 percent and expect states are going to comply because as the gentleman from new york the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on crime and criminal justice of the committee on the judiciary indicated states would have to spend more money than they get besides that the mccollum amendment does not deal with a very serious problem that the hughes substitute does and that is inadequate sentencing read the language of the hughes substitute it requires the states to give assurances to the department of justice that the sentences imposed are designed to provide sufficiently severe punishment for violent offenders eightyfive percent or 95 percent of an inadequate sentence is inadequate and that is part of our problem the hughes amendment was developed in subcommittee in a bipartisan fashion to try to deal with a myriad of different statutes around the country very few states have identical sentencing patterns they are not very similar to the federal system and they are not similar to one another we cannot mandate 85 percent truth in sentencing we do in the
