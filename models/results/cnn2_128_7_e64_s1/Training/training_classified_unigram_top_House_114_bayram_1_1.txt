chaffetz and chairman goodlatte for their hard work on this package of bills that will help push the government out of the way of the american people i am especially grateful that the alert act which i introduced earlier this congress is included as title ii of the bill the constituents that i represent in northeast texas work hard every day to provide for their families and to contribute to their communities but i can tell you from countless conversations that they are fed up with a federal government that has been invading every aspect of their lives they are frustrated with unaccountable unelected bureaucrats who create regulations that have the force of law regulations that typically appear out of nowhere and bring with them huge price tags for the cost of compliance often with little time to prepare and implement them in some cases regulators are unforgiving to those who either cant or dont timely comply by imposing criminal penalties now lets pause to think about that bureaucrats hammering otherwise lawabiding americans with criminal penalties for regulatory violations at a time when the same administration is giving a free pass to millions of illegal aliens for breaking immigration laws giving early release to tens of thousands of prisonersviolent criminalsand turning loose radical islamic terrorists from guantanamo it is little wonder that my constituents are outraged and if it were up to this administration the problem would get worse not better to underscore that point we need only look at the federal register where agencies publish their mandates that document contained 82 000 pages last year meaning that this administration averaged more than 224 pages of new regulations every day of the year americans have every right to demand to know what we are doing here in congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of regulations part of the answer should be that current law requires an update twice a year on federal regulations being developed by federal agencies but guess what under this administration these updates have either been late or not issued at all and until now there hasnt been a way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable my bill does just that this bill forces the executive branch to make the american people aware of regulations that are coming down the track and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of that regulationits impact on jobs and the legal bases for itis made available to the public for at least 6 months predictably the president and others argue that this bill is too tough on regulators but do you know what i am here to fight for hardworking americans not for unelected washington bureaucrats ensuring that folks arent steamrolled by new regulations should be a nobrainer transparency shouldnt be controversial it shouldnt be optional and it shouldnt be a partisan issue that is why i was honored to introduce the

years ago 1 5 million armenians along with the syrians and greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george tutunjian

marketable skills from technical training in mechanics it and health care to leadership qualities ethics and problemsolving abilities yet too many of them struggle to find employment after they have

the va should refine and upgrade its military skills translator tool to more accurately reflect the transferable skills of transitioning military veterans the va should also increase public awareness

years of hard work of listening to various outside groups and trying to understand the difficulty of saving for higher education that many working families are experiencing today the legislation before us h r 529 as the chairman of the committee just pointed out is a commonsense proposal with some reasonable technical corrections to the 529 savings plans that already exist in all 50 states allowing for the qualification expense for computers and software which is a new learning tool that sometimes is required in the classroom for higher education it allows for the refund of tuition and expenses if you had to withdraw from college for some reason and it also reduces and minimizes the unnecessary bureaucratic and administrative paperwork in that respect there are some commonsense steps that we can do to modernize the 529 program and make sure that it is working for more families i do agree with my colleague from illinois that we have a challenge of trying to democratize these programs a lot more we have roughly 3 percent participation rate in 529s throughout the entire nation we have got to figure out a way to do a better job of increasing those savings opportunities for more families but especially lower income families that dont have the disposable income right now in order to participate in these programs whether it is the tax credit that representative davis was talking about employer matches by thinking creatively of how we can democratize these so more families can take advantage of them that is going to be crucial in wisconsin alone we have got roughly 257 000 accounts in the state edvest program and tomorrows scholar 529 plans the families have saved about 3 7 billion for college or their technical schools reducing the need for greater student loans helping them access college these programs not only encourage savings for college but help middle class families get in the habit of saving for other important life events such as retirement that we have to do a better job at i also think given that the congressional budget office has a cost associated with it which is roughly 5 million a yearnot a lot in federal budget termsthat there is no reason at all why we couldnt have brought this legislation to the floor today with an acceptable payfor so we are not adding any deficit to future generations in fact again representative davis offered during the committee markup a responsible amendment that would have done a better job of means testing the 529 contributions and cutting it off to families that earn up to 3 million now to put this in perspective the top 1 percent of income earners in wisconsin earn less than 1 million so it was still a very generous high threshold but it was enough money to pay for the 51 million expense over the next 10 years that the congressional budget office scored this at there is no reason why we cant be making these type of tough decisions as well when it comes to policy changes that make sense for working families and act in a more fiscally responsible manner i think these 529 accounts have been established they do work well for those who can participate and this is especially important for a state like wisconsin today whose governor just submitted a budget proposal calling for a cut of over 300 million out of our university system a university system that is really the pride and joy of the state of wisconsin has given us a competitive advantage not only in the upper midwest but throughout the nation and the world where we had some of the top scholars and researchers wanting to come there to do their work students wanting to stay in the state so they can participate in these uw system colleges and universities that we have obviously the governor wants to take it in a different direction 300 million worth of cuts gets into the bone so again we have got to think creatively of how we can make it affordable for families to be able to send their kids on to school

i may consume i want to begin by agreeing with my friend in terms of the appropriations process itself he is right to celebrate the appearance of one of the bills down here under an open rule just as i am sure my friend is aware the committee on appropriations under mr rogers and mrs loweys able leadership has actually produced a series of bills ready and lined up so i have no doubt this is the first of many billsi would hope all billsthat we eventually see on the floor that every member has an opportunity to come down here and amend as they see fit i also want to appreciate what my friend had to say about the va and military construction bill i think he is absolutely correct that is one of our very best subcommittees chairman dent and congressman bishop are chair and ranking member they work together extremely well while i know my friend has some concerns with specific provisions of that again this is a process as he knows this is our opening process we will see what happens i think at the end of the day that particular legislation will garner a great deal of bipartisan support in part because of the very points my good friend made in talking about the bill now lets move to zika here we obviously have a different point of view let me posit some things that perhaps those watching this debate and discussion arent aware of first 600 million has already been deployed for zika that was out of money set aside for both ebola and other infectious diseases that money by the way totaled over 5 billion originally there is still close to 3 billion of it left it was to be spent over several years so when the president made his request the initial response from chairman rogers was spend this money now dont wait on congress to act you have got available resources the administration eventually agreed with that point of view so to this point nothing has been left undone because of money everything the federal government has wanted to do has been fully funded and indeed in that fund there is still well over 2 billion so literally everything it plans to do in the timeframe it plans to do it can be done so that is 600 million of the 1 9 billion immediately available this bill would provide another 622 million which is actually more money than the administration plans to spend in this fiscal year so they will have more than enough resources in the bill there is actually money included for the national institutes of health that will not be spent until next year as they work through the process of developing vaccines and diagnostics so there is more than adequate funding here finally in the remainder of the year when we get to the laborhhs bill and the foreign operations bill we will put in literally hundreds of millions more money for fiscal year 2017 that 1 9 billion isnt to be used right now it is to be used over a 2year period so you dont need all of it right now the key difference is not the amount of money the key difference is number one this is offset my friend is correct about that it is paid for rather than saying we are going to just immediately add an additional 1 9 billion to the national debt say look we have money set aside we have got money here we can offset through other unused funds and we have got money in the regular appropriations process for next year all of this can and should be paid for frankly it is not like a hurricane sandy or a hurricane katrina with massive damage immediate response required this is actually smaller more manageable and these are moneys spent over not a short period of time but over a couple of years so this is actually the prudent way to actually move forward on this money but again the important thing to know is everything that has needed to be done has been done there hasnt been anything delayed nothing has been set back frankly what mr rogers offers us will actually speed money to the process the debate here again as i said in my opening remarks isnt about zika it is about whether or not you want to pay for the response and that requires some tough choices to be made that means other things that arent emergency might not get as much funding the administration like anybody else if they can have their cake and eat it too is delighted to do so the more prudent path is to actually pay for the emergency that you have if you can if you cant then you move to something bigger but in this case we have the ability to do that and i think we ought to do it i would hope our friends work with us on this we see that this is an emergency we have provided money immediately we are moving now prudently to provide additional money more than is needed in the short term and frankly as the bills roll out you will see that there will be additional money yet to comemoney that by the way was not intended to be spent until next year anyway so there is no reason to spend it all right now i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.44736188650131226,

gentlemans explanation i believe that is not the case and a deviation from the announced policy at the beginning of the year it seems to me that it is a pragmatic judgment that some amendments are making it difficult on the gentlemans side of the aisle as someone who has been here for some period of time that has been my experience when we were in the majority that the gentlemans side under open rules offered a lot of very difficult amendments that we had to confront the maloney amendment obviously was a difficult amendment for members to confront on the gentlemans side and led to the defeat of apparently one of the bills the energy and water bill which failed on this floor would i not be correct in saying that this is a policy that is now being pursued that is different from that which was represented at the beginning of the year where the floor would be open to any and all amendments and would be considered by the house on their merits i yield to the gentleman from

make sure that we are not attacked then my recommendation would be vote yes on the rule and vote yes on the bill it is a pretty simple choice here or you can go back and explain to most of the people in your district who agree that we need to protect our countryit is something across our country from coast to coast that says this is something that is worth doing and i think we need to look at that i do want to hit this hard in just a moment there are timesand especially when you come to a decision like thiswhen we understand how we got here and that it was put together by six chairmen who over the weekend and this past week after the tragic result of last friday night in paris have put together this first step in legislation to deal with this and there will be other steps coming but to characterize this as something that basically has not been consideredthere are committees the judiciary committee on which i serve the homeland security committee and others who have been looking at this issue for a long time this is something that has come together and it gives us an immediate first step and it makes a very clear choice do you want to add a layer of protection to protect the american people or not if you dont want to vote no if you dont want to do that vote no vote no on the rule vote no on the bill talk about the process whine about whatever you want but this is a clear choice the bill is protection or not the other issue that we need to really just assess here is when we look at what we are doing the question is about leadership and the question is about how are we going to protect those it doesnt shut it down also it was just mentioned just a little bit ago that there was a hearing right now the implication was that the hearing had something to do with this bill lets just be very clear the hearing is about the syrian refugee issue as a whole not this bill we are not taking away from that this is an issue and a hearing that had been planned it is happening those are other discussions that will be coming forward so lets at least make sure that we are giving the right implications on what is going on on the hill right now i reserve the balance

introduced by the gentleman from new york this bill requires the department of homeland security through the office of intelligence and analysis to conduct a terrorism threat assessment of the transportation of chemical biological nuclear and radiological materials across our land borders and within the united states as a fellow new yorker i share congressman higgins security concerns related to the transportation of spent nuclear fuel across the canadiannew york border it is an appropriate response to have the department of homeland security conduct a risk assessment related to this initiative dhs is responsible for assessing potential terror threats against the homeland threats related to cbrn materials are one of the most serious terrorist groups have long had an interest in using cbrn materials in addition to concerns that terror groups may try to create or purchase cbrn materials there are concerns that terrorists could exploit such materials with legitimate commercial uses including when such materials are transported from one location to another it is this concern that the bill seeks to address the bill also directs that the results of the assessment be shared with relevant federal state and local agencies including the department of energy and the national network of fusion centers coordination and informationsharing within the department as well as

to bridge the gap to reach across the aisle to get something done because he recognizes as do all of us blue dogs that the political dysfunction that is occurring here in our nations capital is real it has measurable costs and it is preventing our country sadly from solving the problems that our constituents send us here to solve whether it is the economic recovery that could be stronger whether it is fixing our nations deficit whether it is fixing a broken immigration system or an array of other issues that are pressing that are important to the people back home the next gentleman who would

strong numbers passed the 21st century cures bill let me tell you why that bill matters it matters because of people like this this is a picture of rhoda mull a woman that i had the opportunity to spend some time with this monday when we sat together for a period of time talking about a number of issues but most specifically her life rhoda is an attorney of some distinction she worked with a major pharmaceutical firm dealing in complex legal issues traveling throughout the world in about 2007 she began to feel a little droop in her foot it continued to move further up ultimately after numerous consultations with physicians she was diagnosed with als better known to many as lou gehrigs disease and thus began the slow but continuing challenge of the ability for her to move about but rhoda much to the inspiration didnt allow this to hold her back quite the opposite she embraced the challenge of the moment and reached out to become a voice a voice for those some 30 000 people in our country every year who are victimized by the disease lou gehrigs disease als she came to be a voice for those people it is one of the reasons why what we can accomplish with 21st century cures is so important let me talk for a second about the fact that she was a voice today this body is very likely to deal with the issue of something called the steve gleason act it is an act which will enable the voice recorder that allows rhoda to speak to be able to be approved in such a manner that they will not have to have these important communication tools capped by a rental policy that has been part of cms attempts to try to deal with the costs associated with these devices one of the things that we are working on is to allow people to have continued access to these technologies to see the courage of rhoda a vibrant woman in her mind but who isnt capable of feeding herself or dressing herself yet is able to speak with me inside this mind there are tremendous things going on and as she moved to that voice box and communicated with me it inspired me to say we have got to continue to fight for people like rhoda who has been given a voice we must stand here and give her a voice as well to fight for passage of the steve gleason act today and to reach out to our colleagues on the other side of this building to make sure that we fight for the passage of 21st century cures als is just one of thousands of conditions for which we have no real cure we have made tremendous advancements in medicine in the last two decades there is still much we do not know about conditions like multiple sclerosis and alzheimers i have some good news to share with rhoda just last week the house approved the 21st century cures act that will direct money towards research into cures for conditions like als it expands lifesaving research into conditions that affect millions of americans increasing the budget of the national institutes of health by 10 billion over the next 5 years it cuts the red tape and bureaucracy just as importantly that stands between us and groundbreaking new treatments and will help train the next generations of doctors scientists and researchers millions of americans with conditions like cancer alzheimers als cystic fibrosis and others stand to benefit from this research i urge my colleagues on the other side of the senate to get behind this and pass the 21st century cures act i urge my colleagues in this house to stand up today and cast an important vote in support of the steve gleason act"], [0.45324331521987915, 0.9532433152198792, 1, "well everybody agreed as
