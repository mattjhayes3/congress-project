has up to now only failed in the senate we will talk about the magnitude of this vote and the importance of reaching an agreement before tuesday it is time to stop pontificating and start acting like members of congress the nation calls for a solution and republicans are the only ones to offer solutions in legislation in debate on the floor and with actual votes my friends on the other side of the aisle will go on and on today about how republicans are closing the process and shutting out members of congress when were really here providing for the flexibility for the speaker of the house to simply work with the senate to ensure a solution to the looming debt crisis deadline is met so that we will not default on our obligations if my democrat colleagues were serious about finding solutions to this problem they would vote in favor of this rule today the facts of the case are clear the chairman of the rules committee the gentleman from california david dreier has issued more open rules in the last month than congress has seen over the last two congressesor for a total of 4 years combined additionally in the 111th congress under the leadership of nancy pelosi and the chairman of the rules committee at the time louise slaughter 26 sameday rules were reported out of the rules committee and in the previous congress the 110th congress under the same leadership 17 sameday rules were reported out by the rules committee in comparison the process regarding these rules in this congress is a far cry from the previous democrat leaderships unorthodox and unprecedented closed processes i rise today in support of this rule this rule is essential to allow the house of representatives the flexibility it needs to ensure the safety and soundness of our countrys economic future over the past 4 years weve seen record debt and deficits which have brought us to the crossroad that we face with the looming august 2 deadline for raising the debt ceiling americans continue to speak out loudly and clear and just as they did last november they are saying it is time to stop the outofcontrol spending wasteful washington spending and excessive government republicans have cut spending at every opportunity in this congress and we are hoping to do that again today discretionary and mandatory spending at federal levels are on unsustainable paths in the last 2 years of democrat control congress has approved and the president has signed into law an 84 percent increase in nondefense discretionary spending and the presidents budget proposes to freeze discretionary spending at these inflated levels america can no longer support or afford this kind of leadership the presidents proposed fy 2012 budget also doubles then triples the federal deficit over the next 10 years and while increasing taxes on the nations job creators by 1 6 trillion sounds like a good deal to the president in fact free enterprise system employers and american workers know otherwise additionally the presidents budget makes no substantial effort to address the unsustainable rate of entitlement spending one of the major aims of the presidents own fiscal commission which he has ignored obviously the president has no intention of cutting spending or reining in big government programs big government more taxes more regulations are directly in the presidents strike zone and that is the process he intends to challenge congress to come right along with him on and keep marching toward the cliff were at the end of the road once again today republicans are saying we are going to have to make tough choices thats why we came to congress and the majority party will continue to do that today over the past 7 months republican leadership has been steadfast in their support for cutting spending and getting control of our record deficit and debt the house passed h r 1 a continuing resolution that brought back spending levels to 2008 levels cutting 100 billion in 1 year in april this house passed a budget that would cut 6 2 trillion in government spending over the next decade compared to the presidents budget just last week this body passed cut cap and balance which would limit discretionary spending cap spending to a lower percentage of gdp and lead to a balanced budget act so congress could no longer write checks that they cant cash without passing the debt on by asking foreign governments and others to make up the difference for us republicans are willing to pay the balance if the president is willing to cut up the credit card and that is why we are here also today republicans have again and again in the house offered commonsense solutions to rein in spending and cut down our debt my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to reject every single proposal so one might ask what is their solution what have they have offered this nation to spur economic growth and to put americans back to work we would ask so let me tell you by raising taxes by raising taxes on individuals on small businesses and corporations alike this is no wonder why we see stagnant job growth gdp that lags behind and high employment ratesand that means we cannot meet the needs of this country even when the increase in taxes hurts our economic recovery slows job growth and places more uncertainty in the marketplace our friends the democrats continue to argue for more spending and more taxation president obama has asked congress for an increase in the debt ceiling and my republican colleagues and i refuse to grant that request without a commitment to longterm spending cuts we reject president obamas insistence for a blank check to pay the credit card bills that he has run up over the past 212 years president obamas unwillingness to address the true drivers of our debt assured me and my party that we cannot achieve a true solution to the debt crisis we are facing today unless were able to make tough decisions the budget control act we discussed yesterday and what we will discuss today is a step in the right direction it accomplishes what republicans and the american people have been asking for since the beginning of this process it

source of energy for the unitedstates and with skyrocketing fuel prices i believe its imperative for the unitedstates to diversify our energy sources by exploring alternatives such as the oil sands in

should continue and be encouraged the pipeline owner transcanada has agreed to comply with 57 additional special conditions developed by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration for the keystone xl project the supplemental environmental impact statement on the project has gone so far as to state that the incorporation of these conditions will result in a project that has a larger degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline under the current code or law and a larger degree of safety along the entire length of the pipeline similar to what we have

to make the legal and constitutional case that he owes to the congress and to the american people before committing american forces to a voluntary conflict but the situation as it stands today poses an important unitedstates national security consideration and it requires this body to oppose this kucinich resolution what are these considerations madam speaker these are the sudden unitedstates withdrawal from libyan operations proposed by this resolution could do irreparable harm to the nato alliance and ultimately undermine support for nato efforts in afghanistan also the longer qadhafi is able to cling to power and continue fighting the more that he will destabilize the larger region conflict is already spilling over into neighboring countriestunisia for example which is undergoing a fragile transition of its own also there are significant proliferation concerns at stake including the need to secure libyan chemical munitions and prevent the flow of heavy and light weaponry from leaking across the porous borders of libya also extremist organizations that pose a credible threat to american interests including al qaeda in the islamic maghreb already are exploiting the opportunity to arm themselves and organize so while i share the frustration of my colleagues i am deeply concerned that an abrupt withdrawal of support for the nato mission would have repercussions that extend far beyond the borders of libya adoption of this resolution would send a signal to qadhafi that if he can just hang on for 15 days more the alliance will crumble and he can resume his destructive behavior and his destabilizing activities in egypt the stability necessary to prevent extremist elements from seizing control could be compromised if the conflict in libya remains unresolved furthermore providing qadhafi free rein by forcing the unitedstates to rapidly withdraw from the nato operation would pose an even more virulent threat to such other allies in the region as israel an emboldened qadhafi regime would be in a position to provide both destabilizing types and amounts of conventional weapons as well as unconventional capabilities through new and existing smuggling routes to violent extremists in lebanon the west bank and gaza extremists who seek the destruction of israel a unitedstates withdrawal in a manner that is called for in this resolution in fact mandated in this resolution could have detrimental consequences for countries such as jordan and the united arab emirates who provide critical support to the united states and our nato allies in afghanistan and as operations experts from the department of defense warned yesterday an abrupt withdrawal from libya operations as this resolution demands would severely undermine support by our european allies for nato efforts in afghanistan in fact it would have a detrimental effect on natos efforts in afghanistan both in terms of weakening our mission partners and emboldening the taliban al qaeda and associated elements it would compromise the safety and security of unitedstates forces that at this very moment are engaged in the battle against heavily armed enemy forces in afghanistan as many of my colleagues know my daughterinlaw lindsay served in iraq and in afghanistan i also have two committee staffers one in the army reserves and one in the marine reserves who recently returned from serving a year each in afghanistan they have emphasized that the potential dangers to our troops there of a nato pullout or a decrease of forces and assets in afghanistan due to a need to refocus them on ongoing operations in libya is indeed dangerous for the united states they have emphasized that operations in libya do not exist in a vacuum recall that the house just this last week adopted an amendment to the national defense authorization bill to prevent unitedstates military or private security contractors from establishing or maintaining a ground presence in libya speaker boehner has offered a resolution that we discussed previously that further underscores that the congress does not support putting unitedstates boots on the ground in libya now many have argued

open to very wide interpretation for example there is a provision that provides a 12month protection from foreclosure to those who are separated or retired because of a disability and rated by va as permanently and totally disabled since its very rare that a servicemember would actually leave the military with a 100 percent rating from the va and the va adjudication process as most of us know can take months if not years in some cases how would this provision be implemented that is left unclear in this amendment for example would a bank be required to give back a foreclosed home if the veteran
