amendments before this body on an important nuclear strategic issue i find it distasteful that we play politics with the defense of our country the soviets now have a sufficient number of modern accurate weapons they can use to destroy most of our silobased nuclear missiles this is not a good deterrent policy because if the soviet leaders believe they could strike first and destroy our ability to strike back they may be more likely to take this dramatic move during a future crisis the advantage of midg3tman and rail gardson based mx is that they will be able to move during a cdsls and possibly avoid destruction in a soviet first strike so adding the midgetman and the mx to our strategic arsenal will help prevent a nuclear war from ever occurring and according to anyones definition thats real peace i would like to have the opportunity to vote for full funding of both the midgetman and the peacekeeper missile based in rail garrison i was pleased to leam that the house armed services committee supported an additional 300 million for research and development of the midgetman missile above the presidents initial request while this missile is slated to be deployed at malmstrom air force base which is in my district i would still support the midgetman regardless of where it is deployed because it is strategically sound however i was disappointed that the armed services committee took funds designated for the midgetman from the rail garrison peacekeeper missile program in my opinion both icbm systems are important complements to the enhancement of a modern landbased nuclear deterrent the united states has not introduced a new landbased nuclear missile since the 1960s while the soviets have embarked on several strategic modernization programs since the 1970s the amendments before us today offer only partial solutions to our need to modernize our landbased nuclear deterrent the rowland amendment would delete all funds for the midgetman conversely the hertel amendment would delete all funds for the mx rail garrison program congressman dickinson has offered an amendment that would add funds to the mx program to 650 million by transferring funds from the midgetman program which would be left with 350 million finally congressman m~vaous would like to cut the peacekeeper program by bringing its funding level down to 100 million while boosting midgetman funding to a total of 600 million in the best of all possible worlds i would like to vote to fully fund both systems however the amendments on the floor precludes this option as a result i believe that the amendment offered by congressman dickinson remains the least of the bad options open to me with the dickinson amendment the mx rail garrison would proceed on schedule and the midgetman program will have 150 million more than was in the presidents original fiscal year 1989 budget request however when that amendment failed i was compelled to vote the mavroules measure which would at least increase funding for the midgetman i can only hope that the other body will analyze this issue from a less political perspective maybe this issue can be worked out in conference

the gentleman from texas and the ranking minority member the gentleman from new york for bringing this measure to the floor at this time as well as the gentleman from missouri for his longterm interest in providing prompt payment of our federal governments obligations in 1982 the congress passed the original prompt payment act which i supported to eliminate late payments by government agencies to federal contractors the act has been successful in reducing this practice by 40 percent since 1982 but unfortunately it has not ended it entirely some government agencies continue to delay payments by exploiting certain loopholes in the current law and taking advantage of grace periods which were established to allow the agencies to adjust their payment systems to the new requirements

1 1989 late payment interest penalties ill be doubled for agencies which 1o not pay contractors who are entitled to receive payment within 10 days of the principal billing in addition agencies will no longer be allowed to refuse formal acceptance of invoices so as to delay repayment and the unitedstates postal service will be subject to the act as of october 1 1988 it is vitally necessary that we take action on this matter by adopting s 328 we will complete the process we began in 1982 i am confident that this measure will bring about the practice of proper business practices by the federal

toward animals however we cant guarantee that i also understand the concern of our church groups they too are concerned with where this type of research may lead but even the church groups are hard pressed to give reasons for their opposition we are tinkering with the very concept of creation and to be honest that makes me a little nervous too however if we were to ban this research if we were to declare a moratorium i dont believe it would stop it because this research is worldwide all we would accomplish is to make such development more difficult in this country and hurt our industry and put them at a serious disadvantage our hearings and research have not produced any information that would indicate that this type of research and experimentation is dangerous or that its unethical or

because chimps and humans are the only known species that are susceptible to aids on april 12 1988 the unitedstates patent office awarded harvard university a patent for a genetically engineered mouse the first patent ever for an animal this special mouse would involve inserting a gene from another animal into the mouse embryo in order to give the mouse characteristics that mice dont naturally have these mice are extremely sensitive to cancer causing chemicals and will develop tumors quickly if exposed to even small amounts this research is thought to be extremely helpful in early detection of

vote to increase the ceiling for 60 days or for a fiscal year we can aigue about the choice but we must do one or the other to do nothing would be to court disaster specifically before us is h r 2360 providing a temporary increase in the statutory limit on the public debt to 2 32 trillion this legislation would expire at midnight on july 17 and fur ther action on the limit would be required before that time we also have an opportunity to vote on a ways and means committee amendment which would raise the statutory limit to 2 578 trillion this is the amoun which the treasury department estimates would be sufficient to last through fiscal year 1988 the amendment responds to the administrations request for a clean longterm debt limit extension and would avoid disruptions caused by the prospect of a series of shortterm extensions the current debt limit of 2 3 trillion will expire at midnight on may 15this friday at that time it will revert to its permanent ceiling of 2 111 trillion which will be about 160 billion above actual outstanding debt after may 15 the federal government will be unable to borrow from the public to finance any current obligations or to rollover existing treasury obligations which mature after the current situation is very different from what has happened in the past in recent years debt limit extensions have been required as the government bumped up against the ceiling under those circumstances treasury had some administrative flexibilityincluding deferring investment inor disinvestingtrust fundsin order to continue on a shortterm basis to borrow from the public to pay bills due make benefit payments and meet other obligations those circumstances do not apply today when the debt limit expires on may 15 it will revert to a level that is 160 billion below actual debt subject to limit treasury spokesmen have testified that there is no administrative flexibility to manage cash when the debt is well in excess of the permanent limit no new treasury securities can be issued and maturing issues must be redeemed as long as cash is available officials have testified that the treasury will run out of cash on may 28 on that date treasury bills totaling 14 7 billion will mature and in the absence of an increase in the debt limit treasury will have to refund those maturing obligations from its current operating cash balance a similar refunding will occur on may 21 treasury has reported that it will not have sufficient cash to refund those obligations and that the unitedstates government would then be in default such a default would be unprecedented and one could only speculate upon the adverse reaction in financial markets to such an occurrence with regard to social security and other benefit payments due in june treasury has stated that it would be unable to make those payments even if the trust funds were disinvested this is because the debt is so far in excess of the permanent limit that disinvestment of the trust funds would not provide sufficient additional borrowing authority to allow treasury to raise the cash needed to pay benefits i should make it clear that i do not favor disinvestment because it costs taxpayers a lot of money in the long run and it confuses beneficiaries but that is not a real alternative now in any case according to treasury disinvestment would not work this time the requirement for increases in the debt limit is always a contentious issue and this year is no exception particularly when our fiscal house is so badly in need of repair there are tremendous pressures to try to resolve budget policy and budget process issues with the debt limit bill held hostage to that effort i cant quarrel with those who argue that the budget process doesnt work and perhaps should be completely reworked or with those who argue that we need to correct the constitutional flaws of the grammrudman law and restore its effectiveness i would only say that we have limited time in which to resolve these issues if they are linked to the debt limit extension and i would hope that we can start that essential process today the simple truth madam chairman is that the way to control our public debt is to control our tendencies here to authorize and appropriate more than we can afford by the time we are asked to raise the legal ceiling the money already has been spent and creditors are knocking on our door i understand that many of my colleagues feel that a vote on the debt limit is the only lever available to express their opposition to congressional spending excesses but

as 800 next year is not fair to persons who have saved for their health care or have purchased private insurance policies this will force senior citizens to become dependent on the federal government even if they do not need or want to third the potential exists under the new prescription drug benefit for medicare subscribers to bear the cost of treating aids patients victims of aids who qualify for medicare under the disability provisions would also qualify for the drug benefit it is not fair to force seniors to shoulder the burden of the very expensive 10 000 per yearl aids treatment finally the bill could cost seniors a lot of extra money without giving them many extra benefits each year the premiums and deductibles will be indexed to cover the cost of the programs this means

support the argument lies by those of my colleagues who are going to support the bennett amendment that because of the differences between the house position and the senate position we will normally go halfway and we will end up at a higher level i am not so sure that that argument holds today because traditionally the difference between the senate committee position overall and the house has been fairly signifcant this year they are closer together and because of that i do not think that we are going to have the options of going halfway i think that we are going to have to realistically look at those programs and decide what it best what is the most reasonable level given the scarce resources that we have accordingly i think that there will be an increase over the committee position but i do not think that it is going to be of the magnitude that we have had in past years because of that i think that the committee position is sound a number of us are going to vote no on all the funding level amendments and stick with the house committee position which i think sets the best level for sdi research funding this year"], [0.3952189311385155, 0.10478106886148453, 0, "i rise in

realistic chance for discussion of differences of opinion among the 435 members of the house of representatives there is a real difference of opinion on this issue it is very controversial and we know it if an open rule had been granted i would have offered an amendment to address what i believe to be the most pressing aspect of the issue jobs lost to overseas competition my amendment would have limited the scope of the bill to only mass layoffs or the plant closing which occur because unitedstates companies are shifting the lost jobs to foreign countries let me say on this that i believe the 86 percent of the people who were polled in favor of plantclosing notification oppose companies going to foreign countries when we see an at t leave louisiana with 9 000 jobs to go to a foreign country i think that is wrong i think that we do need to have a bill to give people notice when we have one of our companies going to foreign countries i ask the members to vote no and to give me an opportunity to offer this amendment"], [0.4020801782608032, 0.9020801782608032, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding mr chairm~an yesterdays debate was one of the finest i have seen in my some 12y 2 years i have been in congress while i did not support the gephardt amendment i thought he probably made one of the most eloquent speeches that i had heard since serving in this body andi regret that i was on the other side of my good friend and eloquent colleague from missouri i oppose the michel amendment because i view michel really as much more of the same it does much more than eliminate gephardt while i regretted that gephardt carried i am going to support the bill in final passage because there are so many good things in this legislation so many things that are needed and i have lost many industries in my district like my colleague from illinois has i think that the status quo what we have seen for so many years is just today unacceptable we see our industries destroyed one after another by dumping and all kinds of unfair trade practices and a bill that came out of the committee was a finely tuned wellbalanced piece of legislation we have to seen a very strong signal to our trading partners that we in fact do want to work on a level playing field that we want them to treat us as a trading partner like we have treated them we do not always receive that kind of treatment in the the world unfortunately i think that the michel amendment represents a retreat it takes out important banking sections in the bill government procurement sections and in essence it does a great deal of damage i would urge my colleagues not to support michel and support the bill on final passage whether you voted for gephardt or not i have no doubt that in the other body we are going to get something that is a lot more balanced in any event and that is the approach we should take it is a strong signal by supporting the legislation we have before us in defeating michel"],

spoke of work disincentives contained in h r 1720 one of them came up in the committee that the gentleman from minnesota and i serve on the education and labor committee in fact the education and labor committee decided in an open vote of that committee that they would change a program that they have jurisdiction over in which they would say that a recipient of welfare could be required to take a job as long as it paid minimum wage the committee bill does not do that it refuses that provision and denies the education and labor committee just as one example the opportunity to offer their amendment to put in some incentives to work this bill in its present form is replete with disincentives to work the differences between this bill and what i think a majority of the house floor would

wisconsin said that it is no wonder that people do not go to the polls and vote when they see action like this i would suggest that perhaps one of the reasons people do not go to the polls and vote is because voters are being told so many things by some members of this body that just are not so i would suggest that the gentleman from nebraska has just accurately summarized what is and is not at stake on this issue let me make matters clear first of all the gentleman from wisconsin indicated that this rule is here because it was brought here by the democrat leadership bending the rules the fact is that this bill is here at the request of thedemocratic and republican leadership it is here at the request of myself among a good many other people because we are trying to support a compromise with a republican administration even though i myself have strong doubts about that compromise this is a body in which you have to try to have 535 men and women work their will in a united way and in a way which does not make the united states look silly in the process that is what we are trying to do by supporting the administrations request for today second it was stated that this vote is a vote pure and simple on the gci that is simply not correct this vote is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to allow a vote on authorizing every item in the bill which is unauthorized to put that in perspective the gci proposition is about 50 million all of the other unauthorized items in this bill are about 14 billion i would say that the vote on the rule is the furthest thing possible from a vote specifically on the gci it is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to do what we have done many times in the past namely authorize legislation which has not been able to make it through the authorization process so that we can avoid a continuing resolution if members want to be on a continuing resolution if we want to be here saturday if we want to be here next week and violate our promise to the president to produce 13 appropriation bills without going to a cr then vote against the motion if you want to enable the house to meet the obligation to pass 13 appropriation bills in a timely way although we may all have disagreements about specific items in the bill then you support the motion of the committee on rules and go on and support the obey motion let me say also that the assertion was also made by the gentleman from kentucky that if members vote for this they will not be able to do anything at all about the gci for the next 6 years is the furthest thing possible from the truth we have limited oci appropriations in the obey amendment to 50 million not 70 million precisely because a good many people on this side of the aisle share a feeling that i think is held on the part of many people on that side of the aisle that at the present time our third world policy the baker policy and the policies of the world bank are in some respects misguided we think that they do not specifically take into account the need for our own agriculture sector to grow and our own manufacturing sector to grow so we have limited the appropriation to 20 million below the amount requested by the administration and i have a letter here which i am sending to the secretary of the treasury today and i would invite anyone to sign it who would like to sign it with me which simply states here that future appropriations for the oci over each of the next 6 years are going to be determined to a very great extent by the manner in which the treasury department and the world bank handle this entire question of third world debt i do not believe that we ought to provide american support for any structural loan if that country is required to devote more than 20 percent of its foreign exchange to repay loans because i think that messes up their ability to buy our own products if any of you are interested in joining with me on that letter i would be happy to have your name on it but the fact is this rule allows the house to do what it has an obligation to do which is to send it to the president before october 1"], [0.4101312756538391,

this piece of legislation through the committee on agriculture and i am sure through the floor here today he did it very skillfully and he showed his legislative ability in working with the different groups in the committee this bill should not be criticized because of the dairy provision in it the dairy provision in the bill is very fair unfair potshots have been taken at it in the press if we would listen closely to the arguments that are going to be made in opposition to the olin amendment in support of the pennygunderson amendment and in support of what the gentleman from vermont would

sovietbacked sandinistas and how much time we have spent talking about the united statesbacked contris let there be no doubt in anyones mind whose side i am on and why i believe the first vote we cast today is a very significant one because it is a vote on the bonior foreignaid plan it is not a contra aid plan only onethird of the money in this bonior foreignaid plan will go to the contras the other twothirds of these dollars in this foreignaid bill are going to go to anybody else but the contras and that is a fact in fact 25 percent of the money in this first vote will go to the sandinistas and let nobody try to explain that that is not the case because i ask the members to show me one communist country anywhere in the world that allows free and independent agencies to make independent decisions of how those dollars we are going to give to the ortega brothers that we allow them to distribute that money as they see fit and believe that is going to go to children that need
