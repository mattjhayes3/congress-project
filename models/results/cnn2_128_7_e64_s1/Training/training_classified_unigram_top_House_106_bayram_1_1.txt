recommit with or without instructions as is the right of the minority let me begin by explaining exactly what this bill will do first the bill amends the unfunded mandates reform act to require committee reports to include a statement from the congressional budget office estimating the impact of private sector mandates on consumers workers and small businesses second if the cbo cannot prepare an estimate the bill allows a point of order against consideration of the bill third if legislation contains a private sector mandate the direct cost of which exceeds 100 million this bill also allows a point of order against consideration of the legislation in both cases the point of order triggers a 20minute debate on the costs and benefits of a legislative measure before the house votes to continue the argument has been made that this bill will result in delaying tactics the current bill has been in effect for over three years and the point of order has been utilized seven times four times by republicans and three times by democrats that is a pretty good balance nonetheless h r 350 constrains the chair from recognizing more than one point of order with respect to a private sector mandate for any bill joint resolution amendment motion or conference report the one vote limit per legislative measure should provide sufficient opportunity for members to receive the best available information on the cost of a bill the intergovernmental mandates legislation was one of the first bills passed by the 104th congress and signed into law by president clinton that law designed to provide information about mandates on state and local governments passed the house with 394 votes and has proven to be quite useful in providing accurate information during the course of floor debate i chaired a joint hearing of the two committees on rules subcommittees on tuesday in which we examined h r 350 and efforts to expand upon the 1995 unfunded mandates reform act we have now had 3 full years to observe how that law has worked and it has worked well we heard from the acting director of the congressional committee on the budget who stated that the 1995 act had been a useful tool in congressional deliberation the cbo director said he had been doing mandates estimates for years but no one really paid any attention to the costs until we passed the 1995 mandates bill that is all the unfunded mandates reform act has done and that is all that this bill will do it will force members to review reliable information from the congressional budget office this information has increased not only member consciousness of the costs of legislation but increased public awareness and that is why we are here today in an effort to make the original unfunded mandates legislation a more valuable information tool to advise members on private sector mandates the mandates information act ha been introduced again in this congress with over 60 bipartisan cosponsors h r 350 was referred to the committee on rules and committee on rules alone because it is a procedures bill affecting the internal workings of the house and providing information to members of congress by compelling cbo estimates and requiring a question of consideration on the house floor on certain legislation this legislation should serve as an effective tool in increasing congressional accountability by requiring congress to be informed fully of the effects of mandates before enacting them into law during our hearing a 32yearold business owner who started his company when he was 19 years old testified and i quote i know i would sleep a little better at night knowing that congress was thinking seriously about the cost impact of legislation on small business owners that was all he was asking that his elected representatives have some detailed information before they vote the average american should be concerned about these mandates as well the committee on rules heard from the gentleman from ohio in which he discussed his concerns about the hidden erate tax that resulted from the fccs interpretation of the telecommunications act mandates such as these which are not debated on the house floor continue to represent hidden taxes that consumers are forced to pay through increased prices or wages reduced job opportunities and more red tape for businesses it is likely that during the 20 minute floor debate on the question of consideration the costs and impact of a mandate will be highlighted and an educated decision could be made about whether to pass the costs on to the unitedstates consumer the bill we have before us today is almost identical to the conditportman mandates information act of 1998 with some technical changes such as additional findings and some modifications due to recodification it is essentially the same bipartisan bill that passed the house by a vote of 279 to 132 in the last congress h r 350 serves as a speed bump to legislation that

device the bill before us today is designed to ensure that the current penalties for intercepting and divulging communications are strengthened it is important to note that many consumers are not even

motion to recommit with or without instructions finally the rule provides that house resolution 513 is laid on the table i am pleased to support this open rule which provides for the consideration of the agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 the primary difference between this rule and the one reported by our committee last month house resolution 513 is the removal of the amendment which would have offset funds provided for relief to apple and potato farmers due to the reallocation of funds by the committee on appropriations which now keeps this funding within the subcommittees budget limits the offset amendment is no longer necessary a substantive legislative provision which constitutes a change in current law has been exposed to a point of order by this rule title viii of the bill a provision which would in my view undermine unitedstates foreign policy goals with regard to terrorist states by eliminating restrictions on the sale of agricultural commodities to the terrorist states iran libya iraq cuba and north korea the reason why the house rules preclude major changes in substantive legislative policy on appropriations bills is that the appropriations process has hearings and is set up for deliberation on appropriations issues while the authorizing process the authorizing committees have hearings on major legislative policy changes and they are set up to concentrate on and improve major substantive legislative policy proposals i think that an example of why the house has this rule is in fact before us today my friend the gentleman from washington included an amendment in the appropriations bill as i mentioned to end restrictions on the sale of agricultural commodities to rogue regimes the legislation allegedly precluded exports from the terrorist states to the tnited states and prohibited federal inancing of sales to those states after reviewing the legislation carefully however the congressional research service for example informed my office that that is not necessarily correct it was not clear for example that exports to the united states from the terrorist states would be precluded and secondly with regard to federal financing at least one significant credit program would have become available to any of those rogue regimes if the administration simply deleted them from the state department terrorist list something by the way that the administration has admitted it is considering doing with a number of terrorist states despite the fact that some of these states have recently carried out the murders of united states citizens in fact only last week secretary of state albright tinkered with the terminology by declaring that the terrorist states are no longer rogue states but rather states of concern it is obvious that various or all of these terrorist regimes will soon be taken off the terrorist list by the current administration i informed my friend the gentleman from washington of these concerns but in the appropriations process we simply cannot amend this legislation pursuant to and after the necessary study to make certain that we are not doing what even the legislations proponents do not wish to do in addition in my view the timing of the legislation offered by the gentleman from washington has been unfortunate we are dealing here with states that have engaged in acts of terrorism against americans in recent years we are dealing with states against which american victims of terrorism their surviving family members have obtained judgments in the federal courts under the antiterrorism act of 1996 for the murders of their family members by those terrorist regimes we are dealing with regimes which harbor murderers terrorists drug dealers and other fugitives from united states justice we are dealing with the terrible message that we would be sending for example to the regime in iran if we were to pass the legislation as is the legislation which is left exposed to a point of order by this rule in a letter just a few days ago by for example the americanisrael public affairs committee the timing of this legislative language the unfortunate timing of the language was made clear the letter reads we have serious concerns regarding the nethercutt language our concerns center on the changes in unitedstates export policy towards iran that the legislation would require changes which we believe are unjustified such changes would be particularly untimely coming at the very time that the government of iran is engaged ina major show trial of 13 iranian jews we are deeply troubled by the direction that trial is taking any action taken to help iran at this moment would send exactly the wrong message to the iranian regime particularly coming on the heels of the outrageous decision last month by the world bank to proceed with new loans to iran now is the wrong time to be seen as helping iran this issue is much more serious than simply the purported attempt to open some markets for american food products we must remember that the ingredients for example in the deadly car bombs which killed hundreds of our brave troops in beirut or the oklahoma city car bombing ingredients from fertilizers to other chemicals also in the opinion of experts may fall within the definition of agricultural commodities which would become available to terrorist states if the language were to become law as it passed out of the committee on appropriations the only option available to a united states president to counter the development of chemical or biological weapons by a terrorist state in effect would be military action in other words this issue is much more complicated and serious than it seems at first glance the committee on rules did its duty pursuant to house rules in exposing the language to a point of order in this rule the issue will under the rule certainly be open for resolution in conference i am pleased that we have been able to reach a compromise on the nethercutt language which i believe contains some improvements over current law however in this particular bill today the agriculture appropriations bill that original language is subject to a point of order i support wholeheartedly including the compromise language in either the conference report on this bill or another legislative vehicle to get it to the presidents desk as

any credibility within nato we have an obligation to support this vital peacekeeping mission i visited the former yugoslavia on two separate occasions in recent years and i have had the opportunity to

billion dollars or 14 percent of our budget is paid on interest which does nothing for us all it does is it meets our obligations on the debt to the extent we can reduce that debt we can reduce the amount of money that we have to spend on interest and free up more money for tax cuts or for spending on other programs that are necessary like national defense or medicare that is a huge blow to our budget every 100 million we can spend down on this debt will reduce this crushing figure we have to face and pay every year this goes beyond the effect it has on government paying down the national debt will have a profound effect on the lives of individual citizens as the second chart will show we have achieved a record level of home ownership in this country and that is great but it is still only about 60 or 65 percent we need to go even higher and those of us who are homeowners would also like to see the monthly payment reduced if we can pay down the debt the government will not be the single largest borrower in this country we will not be out there gobbling up all the money and driving up interest rates we can actually reduce interest rates what this basically means is that we will save in our mortgages this chart shows an example of an average home price of 115 000 so actually in todays market that is probably below average in a lot of areas this shows what you can save on a home mortgage if you have a monthly payment of 844 at the 8 percent interest rate if we can reduce that interest rate by just 2 percent we can save as much as 155 a month which is almost 2 000 a year out of our personal family budget all that is by reducing the amount of money that the government gobbles up for its own debt that can help make that money more available for people who want to borrow money for home mortgages and also for businesses for farms for a variety of other interests we can reduce that debt we face a lot of challenges in the next few years but this is one of the biggest the economy is strong right now we have unemployment of 4 3 percent we have low inflation we have relatively low interest rates now is the time to save the money and pay down the debt because that economy will not always be this robust when the time comes and the economy slows that is when we might need to help the economy maybe borrow money to help get the economy back up while we are in such a strong economic situation is the wrong time to be running debt the size of our current debt there needs to be a constituency out there for reducing our federal debt help reduce interest rates and recognize the amount of money that the government is borrowing and also pays on interest each year in the budget as a democrat i want to make this a very important issue i think for too long democrats have been accused of not being fiscally responsible i think we can and should be and for my part as a democrat i am going to argue we need to save some money begin paying down that debt to reduce interest rates and reduce the amount of money that government spends on interest every year it is the fiscally responsible and prudent thing to do when the economy is strong if we wait we are in no position to do it when the economy is weak now is the time to step up our fiscal responsibility we can all be proud we can finally see someplace in the future where we will have a surplus but lets take it one step further lets pay down the debt"], [0.48811227083206177, 0.9881122708320618, 1, "well again i appreciate the gentleman bringing that up the gentleman says that texas has the largest percentage of uninsured but this is a problem that is national six years ago when president clinton first proposed the universal health care plan which i think was a good idea and if we did not have all the opposition from the insurance industry and the republicans that we probably could have worked something out that pro vided universal coverage but now over the last few years we have been trying in some of these areas as you mentioned with the kids health care initiative in particular to try to plug up the holes and cover some of the uninsured in sort of a piecemeal fashion it has been working but even with that even with the kennedykassebaum bill to deal with the problem of people having preexisting medical conditions not being able to get insurance and a lot of them can even with the kids care insurance we still have the number of uninsured growing nation ally we have to do more one of the things that the president is going to announce tonight is a major new initiative to try to expand on some of these healthcare federal programs to provide more coverage for the uninsured if i could just mention a couple of things thati think are very significant with regard to the kids care initiative as well as medicare he has major proposals to spend money and to do outreach so we canget more kids signed up both for medicaid as well as the kids care program because we have had a problem getting kids signed up i think that oneof the major reasons why they donot sign up is because many times those are the same parents ofthose children who are uninsured and what the president is proposing now is to expand the kids care initiative so that the parents of those uninsured kids can also sign up for insurance using the state and the federal subsidy that is providedwith additional funds that he is going toinclude in his budget i think that is a great idea we need to make sure that we get all the kids but if we can get those parents in fhat will help then the other thing the gentleman talked about is to try to build on the private sector because the main way people traditionally obtained health insurance and still do in this country was through their employer and if we can create financial incentives for employers when they hire people to make sure that they provide a health insurance option that will go a long way as well this is a major issue the other thing too is i am sure the gentleman heard that during the break a lot of the states are really worried about this now and they do not know what to do i know new york and wisconsin and other states are trying to come up with ways that the states can provide for the uninsured but they are never going to be able to do it effectively without some federal initiative i think it is important to have that federal initiative"], [0.48837459087371826, 0.9883745908737183, 1, "today i rise in support of this legislation democrats made it a top priority this year to take care of those in the armed services and as a

extra to make things work some of us tried to get that accomplished in this budget we have an additional 1 9 billion for veterans and then we extend that through the whole period the republicans only

concerned about the president of the united states getting involved in spending programs i would just want the record to beiclear that the president will not be involved with any spending programs that are not supported by the majority members in this house and the majority of the members on the other side so if my colleagues do not want to support any of these programs then get together with the appropriation committees to see what we are going to do but let us not use the legislative process to send messages to the other side or send messages to the president now this is a good piece of legislation but some of us even though we supported the commitment to the reduction of the national debt thought that we should have included the presidents retirement plan that gave incentives for lowincome workers to save and the last time this bill was on the floor members had a chance to participate because it was not on the suspension calendar the gentleman from massachusetts had an amendment that would have improved upon this bill and got over 200 votes as i recall many of the members who worked on this piece of legislation that once again is before us wish that this could have been a part of the package so that all of us in a unanimous way could say that it helps all of the workers in different income categories so even though i will not be supporting this in its present

understands as well our constituents understand i believe we can agree i believe the white house can agree on a number for this bill that will still be more than onehalf billion dollars under the presidents request i hope my colleagues heard that i believe the white house is prepared to sign a bill that is half a billion almost 600 million under what they submitted to this congress so it is not that they are asking gee we ought to include all of these additional dollars it was and i want to repeat in the committee report issued by the majority in the congress the republican majority it says that their allocation was 1 3 billion too little to meet the priorities now that was still we understand 800 million less than the president asked for which was 2 2 they are adding 1 2 back so there is still 100 million under what the committee report said they thought the republicans thought was necessary to adequately fund this bill i repeat again to the chairman for whom i have great respect as everyone on this floor knows we work together closely i think we can work this thing out and i know he is frustrated that we have been at it for 8 or 9 days and have not been able to work
