creation of this new radio station for broadcasting to cuba as one of the few peaceful options available to the united states in confronting the insidlous penetration of cuban aggression in this hemisphere by broadcasting news reports and commentaries to the people of cuba radio marti would serve the same vital role as radio free europe and radio liberty serve in broadcasting to the soviet bloc in europe for tens of millions of east europeans the most reliable information about their country comes from the outside world there is no comparable source of news for those living in cuba the radio marti project is consistent with international law which is in contrast to the cuban governments practice of jamming unitedstates domestic stations the illegal cuban broadcasts have already continued more than 10 years and are a serious problem however we cannot base unitedstates policy on some threat from the cubans that they will increase their jamming activities the creation of radio marti is an important ingredient in bringing to the cuban people the reality of their governments failure at home and its subversive activities abroad the concept of radio marti is based on the right of the people of cuba to seek receive and impart information snd ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers in accordance with article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights nonetheless opponents of the measure have raised a number of questions some have questioned why an am frequency has been proposed for radio marti am receivers are common in cubasome 2 12 million receivers at last estimatewhereas shortwave receivers are not cuba does not use shortwave broadcasting domestically so the average cuban does not need to own one furthermore since the revolution shortwave sets have been very difficult to acquire shortwave broadcasts would thus probably reach only the political elite while the international radio regulations state that in principle the am band is for domestic service in practive it is well established that this band is also used for international broadcasting the bbc deutsche welle west germany radio free europe voice of america radio moscow and radio havana all use the am band in addition to shortwave for their international broadcasts another question concerns the reason for the 10 million authorization for the radio the cost of radio marti cannot be compared to the cost of establishing a commercial station for unitedstates domestic broadcasting radio marti can be compared with radio free europe and radio liberty its costs include not only expensive fourtower directional antennas but also high personnel and administrative costs required by its unique research and program development requirements these include spanish language requirements studios reporters and researchers based in unitedstates cities and overseas some have also asked why the voice of america could not serve radio martis purposes voas purposes and operations are radically different from those for radio free europe and radio liberty and thus from those proposed for radio marti voas mission is worldwide and its primary purposes are to present world news and to express and explain unitedstates official policy and american society and institutions the charter does not contemplate a surrogate home service like radio marti for the same reason radio free europe and radio liberty have maintained separate identities and operations from those of the voa attempting to focus on the news of one country such as cuba would violate the charter of the voice of america and would completely change the nature of its broadcasting efforts much concern has also been expressed about the problem of cuban radio interference with unitedstates broadcasters and whether radio marti will worsen this problem these concerns are addressed in this bill and were discusied extensively in committee but with recognition that the problem of cubn interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting predates radio marti by at least 15 years and should be coiidered as a separate issue indeed the very broadcasters who today are most seriously damaged by cuban interferencethose in floridaare strongly in favor of the creation of radio marti the fundamental point is that cuban interference with broadcasting efforts in the united states will not cease if radio marti does not go on the air long before radio marti in the mid1960s the castro government embarked on a program to redesign its domestic am broadcasting system and to initiate broadcasting directed toward the united states and other neighboring countries new cuban plans to increase significantly the number and power of its am radio stations to meet both internal and external requirements were announced in 1979 as part of a 5year plan and were submitted to the international frequency registration board in may 1980 were cubas plans to be implemented its stations would cause greatly increased interference with unitedstates broadcasters cubas broadcasting plans were made known well before our announcement in september 1981 that we intended to establish radio marti the problem of increasing cuban interference is a separate and distinct issue which will remain whether radio marti goes on the air on not the question of how cuba would react to radio marti cannot be answered at this time although logic and technology dictate three possibilities one cuba may take no action at all the voice of america has been broadcasting to cuba for more than 21 years and cuba has not seriously tried to jam or interfere with these broadcasts two cuba may seek to prevent radio martis signals from reaching its cuban audience jamming by lowpowered transmitters cuban radio receivers this would have no appreciable effect on unitedstates broadcasters including those using the same frequency as radio marti it also would not prevent reception of radio marti in cuba three cuba may try counterbroadcasting however cuban intentions to broadcast with high power on 1040 khz and 1160 khz predate radio marti and are not in reprisal for radio marti in fact cuba chose 1040 khz as a broadcast frequency in contravention of the old north american regional broadcasting agreement of which cuba was a signatory before the united states chose the same frequency for radio marti there is no reason to believe that cuba will relinquish its interest in 1040 khz if radio marti does not go on the air or if radio marti broadcasts on another frequency in fact cuba is already broadcasting on 1160 khz with high power despite the rejection by the 1981 rio conference of cubas application to use that nd many other frequencies even if cuba uses frequencies not allocated to it the use of directional antennas could prevent interference with unitedstates domestic broadcasting furthermore cuba may broadcast to the caribbean and central or south america rather than to the united states even with the establishment of radio marti the united states will still remain far behind the soviet union and cuba in the amount of resourcc and time devoted to international radio broadcasts i believe it is essential that we meet this challenge and provide for the creation of this new voice of truth for the cuban people it is often charged and by many in this body that the united states is losing the battle of ideas and that we are not doing what we should to counter the soviet union unfortunately although we clearly have the best of the argument that is not being made known to the world and especially to cuba radio marti will be an important element in the battle of ideas i urge my colleagues to support h r i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from

purpose of this legislation is to clear away unnecessary antitrust uncertainty that may deter efficiencyenhancing joint research and development undertakings by firms in the united states joint research undertakings can avoid needless repetition of basic research and increase the return on available research dollars indeed with the path cleared for appropriate joint activities firms will have an incentive to increase total investment in research and development and undertake research projects that they could not finance on their own many of our industries are faced with ever more sophisticated foreign competition leadership in these industries requires not only that firms stay on top of the latest technological developments they must forge ahead with new discoveries of their own many of the foreign competitors of american firms benefit from government research or other subsidies not available to finance the research of our own companies this legislation will grant no government subsidy nor will it create any antitrust immunity it simply will create a certification mechanism whereby the department of justice can examine in advance proposed joint research and development activity and certify appropriate activity against public or private antitrust exposure if the certificate is erroneously issued or if subsequent antitrust violations are uncovered the department may after appropriate notice to the joint researchers lift the certificate and restore full antitrust protections even during the period of certification injured private persons could still obtain actual damages if they could establish violations of the antitrust laws an anomaly in our antitrust laws is that firms with a relatively small market share that could lawfully merge under our current merger guidelines may be fearful of undertaking joint research and development activities such joint undertaking among competitors could be viewed under some judicial holdings as per se violations of the sherman act notwithstanding the freedom of such firms to take the ultimate merger step in some cases where the cost of basic research is high a joint undertaking may offer the only opportunity for firms to undertake the research in such cases procompetitive results may attain from the venture even though the total size of the firms exceeds merger guidelines here again uncertainty as to antitrust exposure could deter firms from undertaking such a cooperative venture the antitrust division has tried in recent years to clarify some of the uncertainties by issuing an antitrust guide concerning research joint ventures in november 1980 while this guide has provided constructive counsel for some firms it can provide no assurance of how courts may ultimately interpret the antitrust laws in private antitrust suits which today constitute over 90 percent of the antitrust suits filed in this country the joint research act will allow the justice department to put its guide to work in a way that will provide concrete assurance to businessmen not only as to the departments views but also how those views will hold up in potential private litigation it will eliminate the harassment potential of private treble damage litigation without granting any antitrust immunity or undercutting the protections afforded by sound antitrust policy through this balanced legislation we hope that we will take asmall but significant step to encourage efficlencyenhancing joint research and development that can enhance the longrun competitive position of domestic firms"],

grantees so once a grantee got his pipeline into the federal treasury then the money would keep on flowing year after year after year the bill that is before the committee this afternoon attempts to restrict this automatic refunding provision but does not do so in an effective manner this amendment insures the discontinuance of the preference that existing grantees have over other legal delivery systems by completely repealing the automatic refunding provision the present act provides existing grantees with an automatic pipeline to the federal treasury when their grants expire section 4 b 2 of the bill grandfathers for the 1982 calendar year the supposedly repealed presumptive funding provision section 4 b 2 and a provision which retains some of the procedural requirements on termination and suspension of funding provide unnecessary roadblocks by making it too difficult for the legal services corporation to withdraw funding from a present grant recipient who does not comply with the grant contract the retention of the presumptive funding language makes it difficult to discipline or replace existing grantees my amendment strikes the grandfather section from the bill and removes the cumbersome procedural requirements for termination or suspension of funding this amendment puts the corporation and its grantees in the same relationship as grantees have with other federal agencies mainly the decision of funding or refunding rests entirely with the agency and no presumption favoring the grant applicant this legislation reduces the total authorization for the legal services corporation from the present 321 million a year to 260 million a year the conference committee report on the budget resolution provided 100 million for fiscal year 1982 for the legal services corporation the fact of the matter remains that there is going to be a substantial reduction in funding legislated by this congress for legal services irrespective of what framework the legal services reauthorization takes i believe very strongly that it is better to do away with the grandfather clause for fiscal year 1982 so that those legal services grantees that have been doing a good job representing the indigent can be refunded at an adequate amount rather than attempting to squeeze at least 61 million less into the existing grant arrangement so for the sake of the legal services corporation grantees some discretion has got to be given to the new lsc board on which grantees will be refunded rather than giving half a loaf or twothirds of a loaf or threequarters of a loaf to all of the grantees that have been on the federal gravy train i would ask the supporters of this legislation to think very seriously about the effects of trying to squeeze 321 million into 260 million or less with an automatic refunding provision for fiscal year 1982 it just cannot be done and for that reason i would urge this committee to repeal the presumptive funding provisions so as to give the new legal services corporation board the discretion to pick and choose which grantees will be refunded and to refund those grantees adequately rather than trying to stretch the dollar too far"],

are the barriers and utah is hindered by the fact that to oil shale development and as far as the deposits in those states are not i am concerned most of those barriers rich enough to support a commercial are institutional barriers posed by the operation within the confines of a federal government we think we can solve the technological problems of developing oil from oil shale we have tremendous reserves of oil shale in utah wyoming and colorado we think we can solve the environmental problems of developing oil from oil shale the only thing we really have to do that is of any concern to this congress is removing the institutional barriers deposits in utah and wyoming are not rich enough to support a commercial operation under the confines of 5 120 acres which is currently the law under the mineral leasing act of 1920 therefore what this legislation does is extend that figure and allows the secretary to lease additional lands for oil shale development if he thinks it is necessary for commercial production to a figure of 15 460 acres the second barrier is one that makes a commercial development unprofitable at this paint commercialscale operations are hindered by restrictions on leasing additional lands for offsite disposal this legislation also gives the secretary the discretion to issue additional leases for the building of plants the storing of waste disposal and that type of thing anything other than mining so this bill h r 4053 simply gives the secretary discretion to increase the amount of land necessary to make production economically feasible it allows additional lands for production if a company has achieved production and is within 15 years of exhausting its reserves it allows for multimineral development and it allows for the leasing of additional lands to avoid the bypass of small acreage that cannot be mined economically this bill is not a federal land giveaway as some might claim it is simply facing up to the realities or our time that in some states primarily utah and wyoming we cannot establish a viable oil shale operation on 5 120 acres of land we need more land because of the poorer quality of the reserve in order to make oil shale profitable i would urge that all of our colleagues support this legislation as the chairman has said it has passed many times before it has the support of the administration it has the

of rcras reauthorization indeed my state has assumed an important role in the debate surrounding the hazardous waste question and a review of the relevant facts concerning californias current situation is appropriate given the environmental protection agencys claims that california is the fourth largest producer of hazardous wastes in the country a discussion of my states problems will also be instructive to other industrial states faced with similar difficulties during the past several years nearly 100 hazardous waste sites have been identified throughout california the soil and water surrounding these areas has been contaminated with dangerous pollutants and are a profound threat to human health and the environment cleanup of these sites represents a longterm commitment of resources and time as it will require hundreds of millions of dollars and many years to complete the task these 100 altes are only the first to be discovered and it is expected that numerous other hazardous dump sites will be located before californias countybycounty search is ended we cannot shirk our commitment to the eradication of dangerous wastes as many of these sites have contaminated drinking wells with solvents pesticides and other possible carcinogenic materials the existence of these tainted wells poses an unacceptable hazard to the publics wellbeing and as such it becomes our responsibility to prevent such pollution from occurring once an aquifer is contaminated the process of reclaiming it is a difficult and expensive one and the natural rate of ground water recharge is on the order of decades this problem needs to be addressed as over half of all unitedstates citizens rely on ground water aquifers for their drinking water we cannot continue to threaten that water supply by relying on questionable land disposal practices hazardous wastes of all types continue to be churned out at an alarming rate in 1982 california discovered that the actual amount of waste generated within its borders is close to 18 million tons rather than the 5 million tons previously estimated most recently we have witnessed the santa clara valleys citizens contend with a critical waste problem this productive area which is the capital of the states electronics industry has been plagued by a series of massive leaks in underground storage tanks containing toxic solvents the events potential for damaging the integrity of the areas ground water supplies was significant and is indicative of the need for societys greater vigilance in the disposition and longterm management of hazardous waste notwithstanding the numerous hazardous waste problems encountered by the state california has been in the vanguard of the battle to reclaim these poisoned sites our states hasardous waste laws have been updated during each of the last 10 years as the extent of the problem becomes understood more fully the resource conservation and recovery act on the other hand has not been modified to reflect the new changes in our knowledge about hazardous wastes it is my firm belief that the adoption of ii r 6307 as amended by the committee proposals will allow our country to keep

interior and insular affairs chaired by our colleague mr udall and the committee on education and labor chaired by our colleague mr perkins both committees favorably reported it to the house with amendments i command mr perkins and his committee for the improvements they made to the interior committees version of the bill i commend the gentleman from kentucky and his committee for the improvements they made to the interior committees version of the bill their version of our bill is in fact the vehicle we are considering today the bill would establish an american conservation corps administered by the secretary of the interior with the cooperation of the secretary of agriculture along with the secretary of labor i might add the program would be funded by using certain federal revenues generated from various leasing and permitting activitiesoffshore oil and gas leasing timber cutting franchise and other fees the authorization for appropriations would be limited to 50 million in fiscal year 1983 and 250 million annually thereafter through fiscal year 1989 with percentage increases allowed each year based on increases in the consumer price index of the total annual appropriations 35 percent would be distributed to the states 25 each to the departments of interior and agriculture 5 percent to participating indian tribes and 10 per cent to other federal agencies and for special projects states would be required to provide 15 percent matching funds and a mechanismincluding at least 10 percent of these states funding sharefor local government participation conservation projects would include conservation of forests fish and wildlife rangelands and soils revitalization of urban areas and preservation of historic sites maintenlnce of recreational areas energy conservation and production of renewable resources work on private lands would be permitted providing they are fully documented as to the public benefit and reimbursement for any nonpublic benefits the program would have both a yearround and a summer component enrollees must be unemployed and between the ages of 16 and 25 for the yearround program and between 15 and 21 for the summer program special consideration in the recruitment and selection of enrollees would be given to disadvantaged youth who live in areas of substantial unemployment opportunities for training and academic study would be provided and certification granted for skills acquired by enrollees i would also like to bring out the fact that in our committees hearings we had very strong testimony which the committee agreed with that this must not be limited to only disadvantaged and only minority youth that we want a cross section of our population but with special consideration being given to disadvantaged and minority youth the bill also clarifies the federal employee status of the enrollees and crew leaders volunteers may be used to supplement the program no funding would be provided if any projects would result in the misplacement of existing employees or impair existing contracts for services the secretary of the interior would provide for research and evaluation of the program and would submit a report to the president and to the congress on the activities of the program not later than december 31 of each year these are some of the highlights of the legislation i will let my colleagues from the committee on education and labor note the improvements they have made in the bill which i heartily support before concluding however i do want to emphasize that this bill while relatively modest in terms of funding offers much needed help not only to our nations unemployed youth but also to the productivity of our nations lands and resources youth unemployment today is running at the level of 23 percent and minority youth unemployment at the level of almost 50 percent one of the obligations of the congress through our political institutions is to assure all of the elements of our society that they are being given the kind of consideration that recognizes that they have an important role to play and i suggest again that this bill while modest does address itself to that concern and to their needs likewise it addresses itself to another serious national problem the deterioration of our lands and particularly publicly owned lands and other resources increasingly affected such as federal state and local parks wildlife refuges forests water resources historic sites and community facilities as i mentioned earlier h r 4861 was the outgrowth of oversight hearings held by the committee on interior and insular affafis and the committee on government operations in 1981 concerning two youth conservation work programs which were scheduled for termination by the administrationthe youth conservation corps a summer program and the young adult conservation corps a yearround program both programs had proven to be cost effective in providing needed conservation work as well as training and jobs for unemployed youth the ycc we found in our hearings returned 1 04 in work value for every dollar expended and the yacc returned 1 20 in work value for every dollar expended i am inserting at theend of my remarks a partial list of organizations that have strongly supported the bill this is a broadbased coalition and represents the wide

the oversight of that particular program what i am asking is what is meant by that let us take the case of the committee on aging we have had that as an example is the gentleman in this particular case saying that if the congressional committee on aging wanted to ask a legal aid employee to testify even though it did not relate to funding or authorizing that particular program but rather to

give some increases we increased that budget in elementary and secondary education and the rest of the educational areas by about 3 billion over last years spending so no one should think that those

supposed to combine all of the various recommendations into one package and then send them to the house floor once again this house under your leadership is following a procedure which is in violation of the law and also in violation of the specific instructions written in the first budget resolution a word about this very restrictive rule it allows only three amendments first the agriculture committee amendments which will not be amendable second an amendment to be offered by the chairman of the foreign affairs committee the gentleman from wisconsin dealing with the distribution of dairy products abroad which will not be amendable and third an amendment in the nature of a substitute to b offered by the ranking minority member of the committee on agriculture the gentleman from virginia which also will not be amendable this is highly unusual this bill makes basic changes in agricultural programs and this highly restrictive approach prohibits the house from considering significant alternatives and amendments which were presented to the rules committee and also in committee for example the gentleman from iowa appeared in the rules committee when this rule was being considered last week and made the point that corngrowers who participate in the diversion program are not treated as well as wheatgrowers who participate in the diversion program yet under this procedure nothing can be done to try to make this situation more equitable the gentleman from wisconsin appeared with a similar problem he had an amendment to the dairy part of the bill which he had worked out with several other members he stated in the rules committee that his amendment would save more money than any other proposal before us that it would eliminate the surplus more quickly than any other proposal before us and that it would do so in a way that preserves the traditional family dairy farm yet under this rule the lioule will never have an opportunity tj consider that approach finally there is no doubt in my mind that the agriculture committee proposal fails to save the amount required under the reconciliation instructions instead of reducing expenditures by 5 billion over 3 years this bill would save only 882 million the first budget resolution directed the agriculture committee to report reconciled savings of 0 779 billion in it called for 1 083 billion in 1984 and 1 428 billion in 1985 for a total of 3 29 billion savings assumed but not reconciled were 1 070 billion in 1983 0 6 billion in 1984 0 2 billion in 1985 for a total of 1 870 billion together both categories add up to a total savings of 5 160 billion however under this bill we find that dairy savings in 1983 would be 1 068 billion whereas the grains and cotton program would increase by 1 09 billion the food stamp savings are only 0 334 billion for a total net savings of 0 312 billion the total dairy savings over 3 years would be 1 401 billion we would have an addition in the grains and cotton

my colleagues know this program was named for the late senator allen j ellender the president pro tempore of the senate who was from my state of louisiana and who was a splendid teacher and believed strongly in the ability of the young people of this nation to take over in fine fashion in our democratic form of government if they simply knew enough about it it was very fitting that we named the fellowships in the closeup program in his honor i am glad the gentlemen saw fit to increase the funding from 1 riillion to 1 500 000 and to forwardfund this educational program so that it can be on a

students return home enthusiastic about their ability to participate in the governing process at all levels city state and federal those of us committed to the developmerit of civicmindedness among our young people want to see the ellender fellowship program continue and grow in 1982 alone 14 000 students and teachers from 47 areas of the country participated in the program eightythree new high schools and four new states were added more will be added in the 198283 school year but there will be some areas of the country and some students who will be left out i know the closeup foundation is striving to have programs in each of the 50 states but there are limits to the available resources this increase in the federal participation in the closeup program will help to make the goal of a 50state program come closer to reality this federal participation is used as seed money by the closeup foundation to attract private and corporate contributions in 1982 every federal dollar invested in the ellender fellowships was matched by 9 from corporate civic philanthropic and individual sponsors this is a highly successful privatesector initiative i am certain that all of you who are familiar with closeup will agree that our small federal investment is yielding a great return but the reality is that inflation is slowly sapping the vitality of the growth of this program the current level of federal participation was established in 1978 we all know what inflation has done to everyone i do not think every federal expenditure should be tied to inflation but i certainly think that when we are making an investment in our young peoplethe very future of this nationwe should do all in our power to keep pace with the reduced buying power of the taxpayers dollar and rising demand from around the country for participation in this outstanding program since the ellender fellowship program began in 1972 it has received strong bipartisan support there has never been any dispute regarding its effectiveness it is known as a program that worksboth in terms of its effective use of federal funds and its educational benefits those of us who have participants in our districts know the difference the program has made in their lives a statement by one group of students from iowa is typical we can sincerely say that we learned more about government in that week than we could have learned in weeks of class work talking and meeting with our senators and representatives made us realize how preclous is our right to vote i urge passage of h r 7137 thank you"]]}
