questions or concerns of us you can email us at bluedog mail house gov the federal debt is the largestthis nation has ever seen some 8 6 trillion this nation has had one of the largest deficits year after year after year since 2001 i believe the american people are ready for us to put an end to the partisan bickering and clean up the mess in washington to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government the projected deficit for fiscal year 2007 is 350 billion at least that is what they tell us but not true the real deficit for fiscal year 2007 is 545 billion you see when the people in this house when the republican leadership tells us that the deficit that is projected for fiscal year 2007 is 350 billion that is counting the money they are borrowing from the social security trust fund with absolutely no provision on how or when or where the money is going to come from to pay that debt back i am starting to understand now why when i first got to congress in 2001 and i wrote that bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund i am beginning now to understand why the republican leadership refused to give us a hearing or a vote on that legislation last year the deficit was about 300 billion in fact if you look with me here you can see in 2004 we had the largest deficit ever in our nations history 413 billion the second largest deficit ever in our nations history in 2003 378 billion in 2005 it was 318 billion and for 2006 there was much to do made out of the fact that they only had a deficit of 296 billion only 296 billion that is an enormous debt that is a lot of hot checks that have been written by our nation let me put it in perspective those are the four largest deficits ever in our nations history the fiscal year 2007 deficit projected at 350 billion but let me put it in perspective the total national debt from 1789 until 2000 was 5 67 trillion but by 2010 the total national debt will have increased to 10 88 trillion this is a doubling of the 211year debt in just 10 years interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget it is called the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot be repealed that cannot be cut until we get our nations fiscal house in order and return to the days like we saw under president clinton from 1998 through 2001 where for the first time in 40 years democratic or republican the clinton administration gave us the first balanced budget gave us a surplus that in the past 52 years has been squandered by this administration and this republicanled congress our nation is borrowing 1 billion a day we are sending 8 billion a month to iraq 57 million a day to afghanistan we are borrowing 1 billion a day and before we borrow 1 billion today and before the current debt grows by another 1 billion today our nation is paying 500 million on the debt we have already got in interest payments alone americas priorities will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order let me just make this point of what i mean by that the red bar is the amount of money our nation is spending on interest not meeting americas priorities not investing in education homeland security veterans or our soldiers simply paying interest on the national debt that is the red bar you can see in contrast how much we are spending of your tax money on education and on homeland security and on veterans the majority of the money is going to help pay interest not principal not investing in education homeland security veterans or soldiers but paying interest on the debt we already got so americas priorities will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order to help

this fight we didnt invite this fight we did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line and confirmed for us and the world that they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty and respect the sovereignty of nations anl that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battle no other option was left to us or to the civilized world abu musab al zarqawi on january 23 2005 said this we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion over the past few days comes down to a fundamental question what is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defend a policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorism and take the battle to our enemy now this war is unlike any other in history our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hate hate for democracy and hate for liberty thankfully we have stayed the course thankfully we have persevered in both iraq and afghanistan because the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom and liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond and great progress is being made last week the unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated al qaedas top terrorist zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligence and that information came from iraqi citizens themselves a very positive sign and while zarqawi was eliminated finding him brought a wealth of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle and iraq just this past week selected three more officials cabinet ministers to serve in its standing government these are very positive accomplishments but it is also important for us to remember what led up to this war and just a short look at a couple of the incidents over the last 30 years will bring it into focus and vividly demonstrate the death destruction and terror brought to americans by our enemy the iran hostage crisis in 1979 where our hostages were held for 444 days 1983 suicide bomb attacks in beirut lebanon killing 242 americans 1985 the achille lauro hijacking where an invalid american was murdered in his wheelchair 1988 pan am 103

treating these incidents as crimes and not as acts of war providing reactionary measures rather than moving proactively will not work and how do we know because that is precisely what we did for decades and the consequence was 9 11 the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality we could have stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free rein would not make us any safer and history has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lost more bombings and not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorism that is not living in liberty and freedom there are defining moments for every generation and for this generation that defining moment is how we engage in this war on terror highlighted by a very different post9 11 world when we came to that defining moment to that tragic day we as a nation with our allies around the world decided we would not

everybody says manifests are not accurate we do not know who the people are and the manifests are not accurate but thats the security we have today the deputy secretary of tsa mr jackson admits there is a risk he says well they do not want to screen all the containers on the other side of the ocean even though the technology exists despite what the gentlewoman from florida said it exists it works and it does not unduly delay you can drive by it at 10 miles per hour he says the vision of the bush administration is they are going to screen ultimately with technology 100 percent of the containers before they leave united states ports for the interior of the unitedstates but they might contain threats now wait a minute we are going to put them in our ports but we think they might have threats but we will inspect them before they go inland i guess the ports are sacrifice zones i guess most of our ports are in blue states no florida was a red state i am not sure why they want to sacrifice those ports in those states this is extraordinary to me that we are not being allowed this one simple amendment and let us pretend that they are not under unbelievable pressure from walmart and other shippers of goods to the united states to not do anything meaningful because it will cost a couple of bucks morb per container 0j 1845"], [0.48964136838912964, 0.9896413683891296, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i am pleased to join with my colleague from ohio in consideration of this important legislation forty years ago president lyndon b johnson through executive order 11183 established the presidents commission on white house fellowships the commission was given the task of creating the white house fellows program the program was designed to expose the best and the brightest of americas future leaders to policymaking at the highest levels between 11 and 20 young gifted americans serve as white house fellows each year and they truly represent the best of what america has to offer being a white house fellow provides each fellow with the unique opportunity of interacting with officials at the highest levels of government it is not uncommon for fellows to learn about policymaking in all of its forms at both the domestic and international levels while gaining access to policymakers that is generally afforded to only a snmall group of advisers and senior staff as a result the white house fellows program plays an integral role in cultivating the leaders of tomorrow the program is indeed bipartisan and is hailed as a great success by republicans and democrats alike over the last 4 decades more than 600 people have served as white house fellows the program has attracted the most talented of americas young upandcomers former fellows have gone on to serve in cabinet positions as elected officials at all levels of government as heads of industry as distinguished members of the armed forces as leaders in the legal field and as distinguished academicians in some of the nations top colleges and universities i ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 40th anniversary of the white house fellows program and the federal governments

would like to speak to two different issues one is the potential amendment to the voting rights act where a suggestion may be made to withhold funding for the enforcement of the voting rights act the voting rights act is one of the most important civil rights pieces of legislation in the history of the united states and we should not do anything to avoid the full and fair enforcement of the voting rights act that bill should be coming up in a few days we do not know exactly when there has been an agreement with leadership that the bill be adopted as it came out of committee it came out of committee 311 so we would hope that the leadership would bring it to the floor there is another issue that is extremely important and that is the legal services corporation if we are going to have people enjoy the rights that they have throughout america we have to make sure that they have access to courts the legal services corporation primarily legal aid programs across the country are extremely important and we need to make sure that they are fully funded the bill includes a provision where the number is lower than it should be and we need to make sure that the amendments to increase legal services are adopted so i appreciate the gentlemans giving me the opportunity to bring these two issues to the floor"], [0.4904886484146118, 0.9904886484146118, 1, "just so i can

energy and right now are working with our governor to try to find an adequate location for a new lng facility so it is incorrect to say that that cape wind project has been blocked our problem here is that the energy policy of this republican leadership is like going to the dentist its drill drill drill drill those of us who believe that we should be pursuing alternative renewable safe and clean sources of energy are frustrated that those on the other side are all talk and no action we have an opportunity to end our dependence on foreign oil we have an opportunity to create a whole new energy economy based on renewable energy sources and we have not been given the help or the support from this congress or from this president so that is what we are frustrated about and also the constant

every single member of the united states senate republican and democrat both all cosponsored and passed unanimously there was unity there was a desire not to debate the patriot act not to debate the house version of the border security bill which the republicancontrolled senate doesnt like and even the president doesnt like it was about putting all those issues aside where there are differences not just between democrats and republicans i would say to the gentleman from texas but on issues like the patriot act there were a number of republicans who had concerns about it so this is not about one party versus the other but oi an issue like this involving commemorating the terrible tragedy of september 11 and honoring those who sacrificed their lives i would like to think in the spirit here

against raising the minimum wage because i do not think there is anybody in this body supports raising the minimum wage more than i do well it was a poison pill it was a kiss of death because what the
