gentleman for yielding time to me i hope that middle america is paying attention to this debate because one of the most salient points that was just made was that president clinton has proposed what is called an economic stimulus package that is costing 16 5 billion and it is not even included in the budget that they are talking about all the deficit spending that is in that budget which is into the billions and billions and billions of dollars even though there is a 400 billionplus tax increase in there does not include this 16 billion socalled economic stimulus package that is filled with pork g it has got swimming pools in there for various communities around the country it has got gymnasiums in there for various communities around the country it has got parking garages in there it has got libraries in there these are things that local communities ought to pay for but taxpayers from around the country are taking care of their friends in alabama and their friends in florida and their friends in california with these porkbarrel projects and the thing that is most irksomeabout this if there is such a work is that the president has not even put it in this budget it is 16 billion more that is going to be added to the debt in addition to what this does i just heard from my colleagues this is going to increase the national debt by 586 billion over the next year i wonder how many other things we are going to have added to this debt over the next year certainly this 16 5 billion socalled economic stimulus package which i call pork package is going to be added in addition to it we have to start coining new words new definitions around here today i started one clintonomics remember reaganomics everybody criticized remember clintonomics because it is going to cost 1 4 million jobs in the next 4 to 5 years that is how many jobs we aregoing to lose at least according to most economists clintonomics and it is going to lead to a clintastrophy an economic clintastrophy find that in your lexicon if it is not there now it should be the first thing we ought to do is start addressing the problem of government spending just 10 years ago we had our first 1 trillion national debt now we are almost to 4 5 trillion in debt it took us 200 years to get to 1 trillion and less than 10 years to more than quadruple it and what are we doing instead of cutting spending we are raising your taxes more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and that is supposed to solve our problems remember that when you get your paycheck next year remember that when you pay your utility bill and you are paying 400 500 more for gas or electricity inyour home next year because that btu tax the bigtime unemployment tax we call it is going to be hitting each and every one of you the problem is this really concerns me is that the media has not really gone into the program and explained it to the american people it is no wonder to me that the people of this country want president clinton to succeed i want him to succeed but at the same time while he is succeeding i do not want to see him take the economy right down the tubes to a degree that is worse than what we have seen over the last 3 to 4 years we raised taxes in 1990 to the tune of 184 billion and what did it cost it cost us jobs and it cost us an economic recession now they are raising taxes more than double that sure we want president clinton to succeed but we want the economy to succeed even more and the way to make sure the economy succeeds and grows so that we create more jobs and do not lose them overseas is to cut government spending first that is the key government spending is out of control we brought in 500 billion in tax revenues 10 years ago now it is 1 2 trillion almost triplewhat we brought in 10 years ago yet we are still running 300 to 400 billion in red each year so raising taxes is not the answer since we raised taxes 184 billion in 1990 for every 1 in new taxes we have spent 2 70 so the problem is not that we are not getting enough revenue the problem is spending is out of control and they will not make the hard declslotis on cutting spending we had a proposal called the 2percent solution that would freeze all government spending and no more than a growth rate of 2percent per year over the previous year they would not let us even bring it out of the committee on rules to the floor that would have balanced the budget in 6 years without a tax increase that is the problem they want to raise taxes and they want to spend us into oblivion and they are going to do it unless america rises up and says no more no more the problem is they face a dilemma that benjamin franklin said the second continental congress faced and that is they have to either hang together or hang separately and they are swallowing very hard this huge tax increase of president clinton"], [0.00405256450176239, 0.00405256450176239, 0, "i thank the

congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher

what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the

shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the recldess results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which this party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented campaign of misinformation falsely alleging the middle class would get soaked and that small business would be robbed by the clinton plan now the facts not a single family with a gross adjusted income under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i respect that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period working class families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middle class families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directly to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business el paso alone living in poverty despite both parents fulltime jobs will receive 86 million in assistance to lift them out of poverty and reward their economic contribution more than oneinthree of every family in el paso will see their taxes cut and their incomes increased fewer than 1 000 families in the entire county actually have

billion cut in the 1981 act and that means that one defense contractorwho by the way in 3 years with a 20 billion profit paid absolutely nothing in taxes to the unitedstates government most of which he made from the government and he also signed in real dollars the highest tax increase in history including this one in 1993 dollars 308 billion it was 200 billionsome then that is what really occurred the spending was increased 1 trillion in mr reagans first 4 years to be fair with him some of that was social security but essentially the social programs were cut as everybody knows that was the reagan revolution was it not and the increases were in four areas they were in farm subsidies mr reagans farm subsidy which passed was exactly six times the size of mr carters farm program in 1980 by the mid1980s it was in foreign aid it was in the space program and of course it was in military procurement that is where the spending increases took place some of us think that it was wrong to take the load off at the same time that you are increasing spending but some of us thought that there was a laughableor laffer curve that was going to make all that balance the budget in 1984 well it

her dedication to the interests of young children while i support h r 965 1 have reservations about the manner in which the bill tries to achieve its objectives h r 965 consists of two productspecific provisions one relating to toys small balls and balloons and the other relating to mandatory standards for bicycle helmets in response to petitions by interested parties and proposals by the cpsc staff the consumer product safety commission has already ruled on the need for substantially similar regulations in both cases the cpsc found the burden of proof as required under the authorizing statutes insufficient to merit action in the case of toys with small parts they found that they were unable to make the necessary findings under the federal hazardous substances act to justify issuing the regulation codified in h r 965 in the case of bicycle helmets the cpsc found it unnecessary to create a mandatory standard because there was not one but two voluntary standards which bicycle helmet manufacturers used this bill represents congress willingness to interfere in a rulemaking process which we designed i strongly believe that if we do not like the outcome of an administrative procedure it is incumbent on the congress to change the process and not try to address serious problems only on a productbyproduct basis however this bill does address serious dangers to children and substantially improves toy labeling the labels required by the legislation clearly warn parents of the choking hazards posed by toys with small parts small balls marbles and balloons too often parents may assume that age labeling refers to a childs innate ability this bill makes that distinction clear also there will be benefits associated with the improved standard for bicycle helmets developed under this legislation this bill harmonizes the existing voluntary standards into a single mandatory standard that must be met by both domestic producers and foreign suppliers because of the importance of these provisions to the safety of children i will support passage of h r 965 in the future however i hope the congress will choose not to interfere with rulemaking processes of its own

the feds message is always trust us to do the right thing and dont ask why as usual chairman greenspan provided no rationale for raising interest rates for an inflation no one can see he asks us to rely on concepts that have shown little or no relationship to inflation such as the low level of the real federal funds rate this is simply more fedspeak that says little and forces everyone to guess what the fed is really doing and why even though the feds record of monetary policy is a long series of mistakes and miscalculations the fed enjoys the status ordinarily reserved for demigods critics are few and far between more often than not the federal reserve receives positive press for bad policyand there may be a reason for this the fed carefully nurtures its public image by cultivating friends in the media and bludgeoning critics i have found evidence of this in former federal reserve chairman arthur burns papers in the gerald ford presidential library in ann arbor mi the paper from which i will quote reveals a plan to use the office of one of the most powerful positions in our government federal reserve chairman to retaliate against a reporter who was critical of the federal reserve by appealing to the publisher of the washington dc newspaper where he was employed nicholas von hoffman who had appeared regularly as a commentator on cbs and today is a writer for the new york observer was a columnist for the washington post in 1974 he had the temerity to write a number of columns that were critical of the federal reserve the criticism undoubtedly provoked a note from

conversation yesterday about nicholas von hoffman bart rowan washington post columnist thinks it would be an excellent idea for you to discuss the matter with katherine graham he said he has discussed von hoffman on several occasions with ben bradlee the posts executive editor he is certain that mrs graham would approach bradlee on the question if you discussed it with her there are of course certain dangers in this approach bart of course favors it strongly because you would be supporting his view against von hoffman additionally ben bradlees reaction to an approach of this nature might be washington officialdom is squirming keep up the good work von hoffman this kind of manipulation of the press certainly is not an isolated incident the fed to this day feeds valuable morsels to its friends and freezes out its critics to ensure positive coverage at the october 19 1993 hearing before the banking committee substantial evidence was presented that the federal open market committee that manages the nations money supply frequently leaked its socalled supersecret policy changes the federal reserve officials at the hearings all said they knew nothing about leaks even though the

succession in doing so i merely am reaffirming what i have done since the resolution is august of 1965 was passed by this house with about 28 dissenting votes mine was one of them i was the only one that gave the reasons why i voted no in the record and those reasons any interested member can find in that record of about i never dreamed that that amendment or that resolution would pass so overwhelmingly and then moreover adopted by threefourths of the states legislatures for i felt then as i feel now that it would be a damocles sword hanging over the head of our democratic institutions what is the 25th amendment how many of my colleagues here can tell me they know the exact thrust of the 25th amendment in that remark i made in specialorders after that session and that vote in august of 1965 i pointed out that for the first time in our history and since the constitution had been written the worst fears that the writers of the constitution had and the reason they had so much trouble in finally reaching the office of the presidency which they first called the chief magistrate was that they wanted to have a person that could not be imposed or selected but voted by the people and then the enabling statutes that were passed after the first congress in 1789 provided that it said that in the case of the neutralizing the death for whatever reason the vacation the vacating of the office of the president the vice president would be but if that president had had less than 11 2 years in office then an election would be called and the american people would vote so what happened since then the worst fears that i could ever imagine in 1965 have come to pass and not too long after that in 1974 with the resignation under the threat of impeachment of president nixon what was the role of henry kissinger and general haig they threatened to invoke the 25th amendment if president nixon did not resign under the imminent threat of being impeached why could they do that because section 4 of the 25th amendment says that if the majority of the governing body decide that the president is unable to discharge his duties they shall declare his inability and the president then shall vacate the office the vice president becomes acting president and a commission shall be formed thereafter consisting of three persons to be selected by the congress now the congress has never enacted enabling legislation saying the house and the senate will get together and the house will select one or two or all three or the senate one two or all three so we had our president resign and we had since then two unelected vice presidents and of course the unelected president that danger hovers and will constantly be hovering and therefore every congress since then i have introduced a repealer i hope eventually some serious consideration is given to restoring to the original intent the succession laws and the clause represented as the 25th amendment to the constitution i am reintroducing a resolution to repeal the 25th amendment to the unitedstates constitution regarding presidential succession in doing so i am reaffirming a conviction i have held since the amendment was first discussed in the house over 28 years ago and i believe as strongly today as ever that the 25th amendment is a threat to the stability of elected government in this country we value our constitution because it ensures that the government is elected and that the elected government is bound by laws but laws and constitutions are only as strong as the will of the people to keep and enforce them a government respects law only if its leadership is committed to law and we know that this is not always the case in the 25th amendment we have a device that is intended to provide for an orderly succession in the office of president proponents of the amendment had the best of intentions but to conceive and write the legislation that was going to truly carry out those intentions is something else the result is that we have a standing invitation in lawin the constitutionto overthrow the president through the operation of the disability clause of the 25th amendment there are no guarantees to life and there is no way of knowing whether the 25th amendment will become applicable during this or any other administration however presidential succession has been an issue in nearly every presidency since woodrow wilson starting with wilsons stroke and 2year disability while in office then roosevelts death eisenhowers heart attack kennedys death nixons resignation reagans near assassination and later cancer surgery and bushs illnesses and medication i have voted many times over the years in ways that clearly show i am in the minority on some issues and i was one of the very few dissenters in what tumed out to be the resolution calling for the 25th amendment i have introduced legislation in an attempt to repeal the 25th amendment ever since it was ratified in 1967 now who bothers with the 25th amendment and who was going to tell me when i took the floor in august 1965 and was the only one giving reasons for voting no to that resolution that i would see the worst fears confirmed in my lifetime i never dreamed of the extraordinary dangers inherent in that amendment what is the 25th amendment among other things it was passed because apparently it was felt that a great crisis had ensued after the death of president kennedy and the assumption of the presidency by vice president lyndon johnson because lyndon johnson did not have a vice president for a year as stated in the process of political succession edited by peter calvertst martins press new york 1987the orderly transition on the assassination of john f kennedy was not in fact as orderly as it was made to seem to the outside world but compared with the chaos that followed the attempted assassination of ronald reagan in 1981 and i might add what followed his cancer surgery in 1985 it was a model and of course what happened in betweenwith president nixon in 1974was just as chaotic if the 25th amendment was meant to eliminate chaos and provide for a smoother transition this has not been accomplished well what happened in 1974 we had chief of staff alexander haig and secretary of state henry kissingerboth positions which are filled by appointment not election by the peoplesaying president nixon if you do not resign we may have to invoke the 25th amendment these two unelected officials were going to use the disability clause of the 25th amendment to make a decision for the american peopleto force the president out of office later upon the attempted assassination of president reagan in 1981 alexander haig as secretary of state was again at the sceneclaiming to be in charge of the country when in fact there were three men ahead of him in the line of presidential succession such ambition and such ignorance of our constitution and the 1947 presidential succession act is precisely the danger inherent in the disability clause of the 25th amendment in 1985 president reagans cancer surgery caused another crisis in possible presidential succession the presidents reluctance to turn over the reins of power under the 25th amendment during his recuperation period may have caused one of the worst scandals in recent historythe irancontra affair in fact when president reagan went in for the actual surgery he did not want to set a precedent and bind the hands of his successors so although he wrote a letter that followed the format of the 25th amendment he did not call what he was doing an action under the 25th amendment and in fact said that he did not think the 25th amendment applied to his temporary sedation for surgery but what about his recuperationa person does not have major surgery and go back to work at full force as soon as the anesthesia wears off yet i have read that the presidents legal counsel fred fielding together with the chief of staff donald regan made the decision for the president to resume the office of the presidency immediately after his surgerynot the doctors not the cabinet but two unelected presidential advisers made the decision when asked about this mr fielding said that his and regans decision was based on the surgeon saying that the president was ok they reportedly accepted this on face value and did not question the physicians about the presidents judgment it was a terrible thing for the president to be brought back to office that soon a terrible thing for the country reports that president reagan made presidential decisions during his recovery from cancer surgery lends additional credence to the former national security adviser robert mcfarlanes contention that he received oral approval from reagan for the arms shipment to iran reagan underwent surgery on july 13the first arms shipment occurred the next month was the president reluctant to invoke the 25th amendment because of its disability provisionsbecause of the possibility that he could not regain power once he regained his health the 25th amendment certainly did not help prevent this tragic mistake in judgment and it possible caused it because of the fear that power once relinquished could not be regained as reported in the book papers on presidential disability and the twentyfifth amendment edited by kenneth w thompson jniversity press of america maryland 1988one of the drafters of the amendment former senator birch bayh has stated that there was concern about the possibility that a means for a coup detat was beir~g created by the language of the amendment he has said that this concern lead to the inclusion of the presidents cabinet in the decisionmaking of the presidents inability to discharge the duties of his office but the 25th amendment does not even mention the presidents cabinet instead it states whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as congress may by law provide determine that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president in fact in light of the fact that the amenament was drafted in response to the assassination of president kennedy it is significant that senator robert kennedy expressed grave concern about this provision of the amendment senator bayh has reported that senator kennedy objected to the language and told senator bayh that president kennedy did not know any of the members of his cabinet personally until he appointed them senator kennedy believed that the cabinet then was not close to the president and could not possibly offer the kind of protection against a coup that bayh and the other drafters of the amendment thought they were providing and i agree you cannot give those with the most to gain from a decision the nearly absolute power to make that decision and not epemct a o be abused at some point ompounding the inherent danger caused by the disabty clause are the technical prblemis far istance what constitutes an ina llity lo discharge the dulis of the

wishes to keep oonidentlialwhat happens to the physiclanpatllnt pivilege against revealing such information furtera if inability includes berg under anesthesia as many believe despite president fleagans assertlons to the contrary does it also include being under the influence of sleping pills how about inebriation or even changes in mood caused by piescription medication with so much let to inteipretatlon by those who are charged with the responslblity of making a determination of the presidents ability to discharge his duties there is much room left for mischief and what is the incentive that would lead the vice president and members of the piesldents cabinet to movefor their own purposestmder the disability clause of the 25th amendment look at what thwe we have had lately since 1945 but much more so 4n he last decade we have seen the rise of the imperial presidency in this country 1 dare say that perhaps the overwhelming majority of the members in or out of the congress as well as the citizens would say if asked that the president has more power that he is omniscient and that he is of greater power and authority than either one of the other two branches that simply is not true and it is in direct contradiction to the unitedstates constitution yat our presidents have been approaching a position of absolute authority with greater tnomentum every day look at the recent vote by congress to give the president absolute authority to negotiate a freetrade agreement with mexico and look at the recent votes ratifying the presldenrs unilateral warmaklng i was one of only three who criticized the presidential order giving rise to the invasion of panama on december 20 1989 and i was one of onty a handful that opposed the persian gulf wara war that was begun in august of 1990 by the president not in january by he congress when the vote was finally taken i do not take any pleasura in these votes but i am also very sensitive to the fact that we are a coequal and a separate and an 4ndependent body like the other two branches of the government the executive and the judiciary but for good reason the men who wrote the constitution put the lrst article as ihe representative branch the congress ard the second and third articles as the executive and judicial branches in our nations first 10 years of nationhood which really were the first and the second continental congresses our leaders thought so little of this kind of an office that they did not evm bother to have anythng ak il there was no such thing as a president or as they caled it in the constitutional convention delbartions a chief agistrale they did not want to have anything to do with that trom which they were extricating lhemeslves tannicat arbitrary and caprcious power this is why the mst revolkionary words even to this day are the first words of the preamble of our constitution where we read and i encourage every student in my distriot im the elementary schools and on up to memorize that because that is at the heart of the matter even today we t people 1 the united states in order to form a more perfect wion we he people not the congress not the president not anybody else but 1he people why because for the irst time in this world then of kings who said t their power came from god they were saying no hat all power comes from he people we have strayed away from that so that when we end up with any possibility and in act the reality that we can have an unelected president and an ilected vice president we have a tonlinuing sword pointed at 1he very heart of our democratic constitutional form of government as the president gains greater end mnore absolute power it is increasingly important for usto reevaluate the 25th amendment the incentives for blind ambition to govern actions under the disability clause of the 25th amendment are stronger now than ever before we must not allow provisions for acoup detatwhich the disability clause establishesto tr main a part of our law asa nation established on the principle of the power of the people we have provided through the 25th amendment a means of relinquishing that power and establishing ft instead in a very few unelected government officials how can we allow this kind of presidential powerwhich our founding fathers tearad and tried to prevent but which has grown out ol any sense of proportion in recent years to be hold by an unelected president who has assumed power over the wishes of the elected president the 25th amendment allows this and it is wrong it is dangerous and the 25th amendment should be repealed d 1420"], [0.00536009669303894, 0.49463990330696106, 1, "let me just say in response to my colleague the gentleman from missouri when we proposed banning smoking on airplanes the people who opposed that legislation said you dont know what youre going to get started here there will be fistfights in the aisles of airplanes the flight attendants will be wrestling the people to the ground they are going to be starting fires in the restrooms we are going to have more lawsuits than you can possibly imagine do you know what it never happened because we announced what the policy was people voluntarily got into the program smokers and nonsmokers alike we had one incident per 1 million airline passengers one per 1 million and now it is even fewer if the folks know what the rules are smokers and nonsmokers they will play by those rules we will not have to hold over their heads the threat of sitting in a courtroom all day or going to jail or whatever it might be i just think what we have to do is have an understandable policy that people can live by to protect folks who smoke and those who do not i rise in support of h r 881 it is time f6r the federal government to fully protect its woders end visitors from secondhand smoke in federal buildlg including buildings owned or leased by te executive legislative and judcal brances of the unitedstates government on january 7 of this year after several years of intensive study the environmental protection agency formally classified environmental tobacco smoke as a group a carcinogen this classification is reserved for substances which are know to cause cancer in humans including asbestos benzene and arsonic epa found that secondhand smoke causes approximately 3 000 lung cancer deaths annually in unitedstates nonsmokers in addition exposure to secondhand smoke causes 150 000 to 300 000 lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia in young children each year causes additional eplsodes of asthma and increased severity of asthma symptoms in children who already have asthma and may be a risk factor for 8 000 to 26 000 new cases of asthma annually in children who would not otherwise become asthmatic in response to epas findings i introduced legislation as did the gentleman from ohio to protect federal employees from secondhand smoke i am pleased that h r 881 has reached the house floor the epa and others who have examined this issue have told us there are only two ways to protect nonsmokers from the hazards of breathing secondhand smoke either indoor smoking must be banned or it must be limited to separately ventilated smoking areas separate smoking sections that are not separately ventilated are not acceptable because the smoke recirculates through the buildings ventilation system directly into the rooms used by nonsmokers h r 881 does not require that agencies establish separately ventilated smoking rooms nor does it provide funding for such rooms however it leaves open the possibility of separate ventilation in cases where separate vntilation could be accomplished without significant cost of course the simplest and least expansive way to protect people from secondhand smoke is to ban smoking indoors federal employees and visitors to federal buildings deserve an environment that is free from the hazards of secondhand smoke i have received letters and phone calls from a number of federal employees since my bill was introduced describing the shortconngs of the present federal smoking policy and the need for greater protections so that these employees can breathe the air in their workplaces without being subjected to secondhand smoke a federal smoking ban would give federal workers the same protections that many of their private sector counterpart enjoy the society for human resource management has periodically surveyed its members regarding their smoking policies in 1986 only 2 percent of the firms that responded had a nosmoking policy by 1991 34 percent of the firms that responded indicated they have declared their facilities smokefree today the percentage is undoubtedly even larger the federal government should provide sirnilar protection employees of some federal agencies are already able to breathe freely without exposure to secondhand smoke the unitedstates department of health and human services the unitedstates environmental protection agency and the unitedstates postal service have each taken action to protect their employees from exposure to this carcinogen now it is time to give all federal employees the same smokefree environment i urge my colleagues to support this leglslation so that federal workers and visitors to federal buildings can breathe freely"],

talked about this we have been talking about this for the past 3 to 4 years now the necessity for taking this kind of action i think is much more apparent today than it was about 3 or 4 years ago we had the world trade center bombing we saw some terrorist activity that destroyed a very very imporucteber 7 1993 c tant structur at least almost destroyed it and caused a lot of personal injury and property damage one of the concerns that i have bad since 1909 was the possibility of terrosiste with plastic explosives getting onto commercial aircraft in this country with small detonating devices that are not picked up by a metal detector something about the size of the gentlemans watch and putting that detonating device into the plastic on the plans and the timer goes off and it kills a bunch of innocent people flying across this country lne of the ways to guard against this was to build and put in all the airports around the country things called thermal neutron analysis devicee which cost a great deal of money i think that is what they were called tnas the other alternative instead of spending all that money was to put sniffer dogs at the airportsf these sniffer dogs are being used right now to detect narcov~es they are being used by police agencies around the country to detect plastic explosives and other explosive devices and they have been very effective the problem with them i that they are good for about 45 minutes and then they have to have another team come on what we suggested in 1989 was two teams of german shepherds or other dogs or animals that can do this job for the 25 major airports around the country and the cost of that for the training and getting them implemented with the people that would be taking them around to the airports was about 2 million this 2 million takes into account the initial cost of training the dogs which costs about s1oaog for the teams including the dogs and their handlers 0l1440 mr chaitrman a lot of people might say my gosh do we really need to do this there have been meetings around the world of terrorist groups in places like khartoum involving a number of countries and their total objective fs to try to cause problems for their enemies including the united states of amerlea these are fringe groups these are not large ethnic or religious groups but fringe groups that are doing this i want to emphasize that very thoroughly because there are a lot of peopie who may have the same religious beliefs as some of these groups that are not involved in this kind of activity but are tarred with the same brush but there are fringe lunatic groups that are planning to do this so since we know that they have done this to the world trade center and since we know there have been terrorist activities that have destroyed planes and other aircraft ar und the world it seems to me the prudent thing for this congress to do since it costa so little is to try to protect peapie flying across this country on commerctal aircraft from our major aftports or the major international airporte so i would ijst like to say to the chairman of the aubcommittee and the ranking republican that i hope they w4ir take a sertous look at this because i think we would be peanywise and poundfooliah w not do something of this nature and i would ask the gentleman from minnesota emr obmwiar if he would engage n a colloquy with me for just a moment i understand the gentleman has some objection to these arpendmenta right now because he has not had time to really take a close look at them but i also understand that he has said he would take a serious look at these to see if he thinks it if necessary when he goes to conference"]]}
