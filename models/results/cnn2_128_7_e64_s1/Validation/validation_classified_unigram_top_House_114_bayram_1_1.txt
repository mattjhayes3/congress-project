and for his leadership on child nutrition programs i want to thank all my colleagues for being here this is an important issue there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer months as well why are my friends making it so difficult enough enough of this stop beating up on the most vulnerable people in this country lets come together lets reject this awful draft of the child nutrition reauthorization bill lets come together and do this right it is the least we can

harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those

colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this legislation is part of a war on women but in reality it is designed to stop the war on children that is going on in abortion facilities across this country large majorities of americans believe their tax dollars should not go to fund abortions they felt this way even before learning that during those abortions children are dismembered and

facilities and sell unborn children piece by piece under an illusion that no one will ever know their crimes our debate today and the videos that have been released have shattered that darkness and

iraq that is right 3 trillion look where it has gotten us i would like to remind my colleagues that for one of those trillion we could have graduated every college kid in america and vocational school kid in america debt free instead we have saddled them with debt that is crippling their ability to get ahead and our economy to grow it is no secret that bridges are falling down here in america and trains are coming off the rails for one of those trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our infrastructure and transportation system in this country once again creating good jobs and opportunities and laying the foundation for our economy to grow for another trillion of those dollars we could have given the american taxpayers a trilliondollar tax break would they not have loved that and do they not need that instead we are still looking at 2 trillion going forward in taking care of the men and women who served the warriors the patriots the men and women who were willing to stand up and protect us but who lost arms and lost legs and suffered severe brain injuries yes that is right 2 trillion going forward tending to and caring for them and that is a moral obligation that we are obligated to and must fulfill now to my point today last year the congress authorized 500 million to be spent on training the socalled moderate free syrian rebels and now we have learned that only a handful like four to five has shown up for duty according to lloyd austin the unitedstates central commander for troops in the middle east back in june republican congressman curt clawson and i offered an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to stop funding this socalled free syrian rebel program why well the hard cold fact is that many of their leaders told us at the time that they would not use the money to fight and join us in the fight against isil now we ask the house not to appropriate an additional 600 million seeing that the 500 million that was spent has already been wasted and misspent unfortunately our colleagues at the time did not follow our bipartisan recommendation on this important issue and the house did go ahead and appropriate an additional 600 million for that failed program now that we know only a handful are showing up for duty it is not too late to stop this additional 600 million from going forward for this failed program i am calling for the immediate removal of that funding after all we did pass my amendment prohibiting congress from funding socalled rebels where there was clear proof that the money was being misspent the proof could not be more clear in this case this isnt about agreement or disagreement with our involvement in these middle east conflicts this is about the tragic foolish senseless wasteful squandering of 1 1 billion of hardearned american taxpayers dollars mr clawson and i both worked as businessmen for decades before coming to the congress anyone who knows anything about business can tell you this no private sector company ever succeeded by spending huge amounts of money on employees who never showed up for work or worse yet turned their allegiances to an opposition or a competitive company that is no way to run a business that is no way to govern and it is certainly no way to win a war i plead with my colleagues to come to their bipartisan senses join mr clawson and me and help us put an end to this tragic

back to their offices but you and me and i appreciate you sticking around to get this hour in it is not going to be an exciting hour ordinarily i bring down charts and graphs and try to share something in a visual way that folks might not have seen before today it is just words because words matter we have just finished in this chamber this fantasticyou have heard me say itit was a festival of democracy every member who had an amendment they brought them to the rules committee we made over a hundred of them in order it has been 3 days and we passed in a very bipartisan way federal transportation policy for the first time in more than a decade democrats had failed to get it done republicans had failed to get it done we as 435 individual members representing diverse constituencies across the nation came together today and we got it done they said it wouldnt be done chairman bill shuster said it could be done ranking member pete defazio of oregon said it could be done and we did it something has happened in this town that has people identifying as democrats or republicans first and as members of this body of the article i legislature second it is bad it is bad for the country and it is bad for the people we represent it is a bad process that is what i want to talk about today you cant see the chart that i have here but it is a quote from president obamayou will remember itback in august of 2013 you will remember we worked together with the president nine different times we repealed portions of the presidents healthcare bill we repealed them they were unworkable he knew it we knew it we came together nine times he signed legislation into law that repealed parts of the presidents healthcare bill it was the summer of 2013 and we were talking about how to come together on some of the bigger problems in the presidents healthcare bill you remember the mandates were getting ready to go into effectthe business mandates the individual mandatesand the country wasnt ready the country was not ready we all knew it every member from left to right knew it the president held a press conference and he said this in a normal political environment it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say you know what this is a tweak that doesnt go to the essence of the law it has to do with for example are we able to simplify the attestation of employers to whether they are already providing health insurance or not it looks like there may be some better ways to do this lets make a technical change to the law the president goes on to say mr speaker that would have been the normal thing that i would prefer to do but we are not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to obamacare the president says we did have the executive authority to do so and we did so this was from that very contentious time trying to solve problems for the american people again problems the white house knew existed and problems the congress knew existed the president says you know what if it was ordinary times like any time in the past 225 years i would have called the united states congress and i would have said listen the constitution gives you article i powers to legislate and i need a legislative change made because the law is not working he didnt and he said he didnt and he said he wasnt going to he said he was going to go it alone the disappointment in that decision in this body was very partisan it was very partisan i dont know how we get past the allegiance to the president because he is from our party republicans did this when george bush was in office democrats are doing this when president obama is in office it is not about who the president is it is about what the president does what the president does is implement the laws that we pass he doesnt change the laws and every time we fail on behalf of our constituents to stand together as 435 representatives of the people and instead become representatives of the republican party or the democratic party we fail america what i have here is the chart of the supreme court decision in the nlrb v noel canning case you may remember that one i had just gotten to congress i had just gotten to congress the president was talking about making appointments as you know the advice and consent clause of the constitution says the president can make appointments but he needs to get the consent of the senate to do so well the senate wouldnt give him consent so while the senate was away for a day the president went into the recess appointments clause of the constitution in fact we got a big letter from the legal department there at the white house that said he had the powers to pretend that the senate had adjourned for the session and to go ahead and make appointments anyway 1245 the protest of the president usurping congressional authority was partisan republicans said no democrats said ah he probably has the right to do it anyway we didnt stand up for the people we represent we didnt stand up for the constitution we swore to uphold we divided ourselves by party instead of uniting ourselves on principle we had to go to the supreme court the supreme court cant decide on anything unanimously if the question is what time are we going to meet today to talk about cases it is a 54 decision you know this to be true but the supreme court came together in noel canning and said thats crazy thats crazy the president of the united states cant just pretend he is king he is not the king i am paraphrasing when i say that but to quote the supreme court decision they said this regardless the recess appointments clause is not designed to overcome serious institutional friction it provides a subsidiary method for appointing officials when the senate is away during a recess here as in other contexts friction between the branches is an inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure friction between the branches is an inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure that makes me feel good it makes me feel good because i go back home all the time and constituents say rob why cant you get more done why cant you get more done well it turns out it is because of this it is because of this constitution that says listen if congress is at work your liberties and your freedoms may be under attack right what we do here isnt generally to give freedoms back to people generally what we do is to restrict freedoms a little bit here we want it to be slow here in the house we are a little faster there in the senate they are supposed to be a little slower but it is supposed to be hard it is supposed to be the inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure but this bodynot republicans in this body not democrats in this bodycollectively was silent as power flowed down pennsylvania avenue away from the article i legislature down to the article ii executive it took the article iii courts to right our constitutional framework shame on us shame on us collectively for not standing up my constituents are frustrated by the pace of progress in this town they are frustrated by what looks like the politics that are being played here when policy should be our focus i think it is up to us to educate folks to proudly say it is the inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure but when we stand togetheras we have this week on this transportation billthere is still more that unites us as a country than that divides us environmental leadership is one of those areas of overreach that this particular white house is aggressively engaged in again the pushback has been partisan pushback it has not been article i legislative pushback as it should i want to go back to some prior presidents i will look at republican presidents i am a republican i will look at what it looked like when republicans were running the show in the white house the epa was signed into law by richard nixon on the creation of the epa president nixon said this the reorganizations which i am here proposing afford both the congress and the executive branch an opportunity to reevaluate the adequacy of the existing program authorities involved in these consolidations i look forward to working with the congress in this task the congress the administration and the public all share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment richard nixon had a calling when it comes to the environment he had a calling he didnt say i am the president of the united states i am just going to rewrite the entire environmental code and dictate that it is the law of the land he came to congress and said protecting our natural resources is a shared american value it is a shared american value i am going to go to congress i am going to win the votes we are going to change the law and we are going to make it so the clean air act was signed into law in 1990 by president george h w bush he said this today i am signing s 1630 a bill to amend the clean air act i take great pleasure in signing it as a demonstration to the american people of my determination that each and every american shall breathe clean air passage of this bill is an indication that the congress shares my commitment to a strong clean air act how do you know if congress shares your commitment if you dont bring the language to congress to have congress ratify it the president can propose all the legislation he wants to we still have to pass it if our frustration about results allows us to let folks shortcut the constitutional process we will all330 million of ussuffer i remember when president reagan was trying to raise the gas tax i talk about that because we were talking about the transportation bill this week and transportation funding this week he stood on the lawn there beside the rose garden and he says we deserve a world class infrastructure in america and i propose that we double the gas tax yes this is conservative ronald reagan talking about doubling taxes in order to build america america didnt agree with him yet he went out there and sold it how did we get fundamental tax reform in this country in 1986 the country wasnt ready for fundamental tax reform the congress couldnt agree on fundamental tax reform ronald reagan took it out there and sold it every single day until he got it done that is what is supposed to happen we work together to accomplish these priorities past presidents have done exactly that it hasnt been 2 weeks ago we were in here talking about the presidents overreach on the department of labor fiduciary rule you remember that bill we had it here on the floor of the house where the president just decided through the department of labor that longstanding investment law as determined by the sec was no longer going to be the law of the land that the department of labor was going to take on some new rulemaking authorities in this area the president wanted to make some changes congress didnt want to make changes the president said this what i wont accept is the notion that there is nothing we can do so we are going to keep pushing for this rule keep pushing didnt mean come to congress to sell you and to sell me pushing didnt mean go to the united states senate to build a coalition pushing meant ignoring the congress and going straightaway now i point this out as a success i point this out as a success because our opposition to this wasnt partisan our opposition to this was bipartisan i have here a letter from september signed by 90 democrats that said mr president dont do this dont do this this is not the proper path forward the plurality of the democratic caucus here said mr president dont go forward the president drove forward anyway the times that i have seen the president change his mind in my 412 years in congress have not been because of my persuasive oratory or even by the strength of this institution it has been because the american people have spoken when the american people speak the president is a good listener what the president is hearing today is the ends justify the means i need results and so however you get those results mr president i will be behind you we are starting to turn that corner because i promise you whatever is good for democrats today is going to be bad for democrats tomorrow whatever is bad for republicans today is going to be good for republicans tomorrow the parties will change the political environment will change but when you shortcircuit the process the shortcircuiting lasts forever we change expectations of the american people we change expectations of what the constitution means i applaud 90 of my democratic colleagues standing with this congress saying mr president dont go it alone this isnt something that i am just coming up with out of thin air when the president wasnt president obama when he was senator obama he had these same concerns he spoke out time and time again about overreaches of president george bush oftentimes he spoke out alone republicans werent standing with him to speak out because it was a republican president republicans said you know what i want to support my president so even if he is coloring outside the lines a little bit it is probably important to the country that he do so that is a failure that is a failure because our primary job here is not to be republicans and democrats our primary job here is to be article i representatives of the american people the president said this on immigration hes talking at a univision townhall meeting in 2011 he said this does not mean though we cant make decisions for example to emphasize enforcement on those who have engaged in criminal activity this was the beginning of his program but he goes on to say it also doesnt mean that we cant strongly advocate and propose legislation that would change the law time and time again folks would ask him to do what he could as the executive to change immigration law and he would say listen im not the king i am the president the congress has to change the laws i can only enforce the laws he was right he was right each and every time that he said that the administration can propose but we have to implement fastforward to about this time last year and the president says this and to those members of congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better or question the wisdom of my acting where congress has failed i have but one answer pass a bill pass a bill he says in the meantime i am just going to do things the way i want to do things that is the opposite of the i am just a bill sitting here on capitol hill song that we all learned as children the bill comes first the law change comes last after the president signs the bill it becomes the law we have to propose it first how many meetings have you had with the president where he is pushing his immigration agenda trying to get you to buy in to his bill the answer is zero because he doesnt have a bill and he hasnt been knocking on any of our doors and my democratic friends would say the same how many meetings with the president have you had where the president is trying to persuade you about his fiduciary rule and why that change is important for america and why we should move that bill forward the answer is zero because he has never come to capitol hill to make that pitch he is not making it to democrats and he is not making it to republicans he is going it alone how many times has the president come and knocked on your door to try to sell you on his ozone regulations or his clean energy plan and on and on and on and the answer is he hasnt and we have been complicit in allowing that unilateral action it is bad for america it is not the process that our framers envisioned this is what the president said on immigration it is that same univision townhall meeting the question was mr president my question will be as follows with an executive order could you be able to stop deportations of students i am not down here talking about immigration policy today i am not our immigration system is broken i represent constituents who have had family members on the list not for 5 years not for 10 years not for 15 years but for 20 years and more are standing in line waiting for their chance to come to america our system is broken i have employers who want to build in our district they cant get the people they need from their home countries to come and manage those operations our system is broken we all know it we have a chance to fix it but when the president goes around the congress he doesnt fix it he breaks it further he says this with respect to the notion that i can just suspend deportations through executive order that is just not the case because there are laws on the books that congress has passed and i know that everybody here at bell is studying hard so you know that we have got three branches of government congress passes the law the executive branchs job is to enforce and implement those laws and then the judiciary has to interpret the laws 1300 the president says there are enough laws on the books by congress the president says that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president the words of president obama there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president that was march 2011 you wouldnt know that is what he believed in november of 2015 what happened in those 4 years i will tell you what has happened is we have been silent as a body we have been vocal as republicans we have been vocal as democrats but we have been silent as a representative body article i of the constitution says it is our job to legislate and it is our job to rein in those presidents who would legislate on our behalf what our framers feared was an allpowerful executive that is what they had come from that is what we should fear today not a republican president not a democratic president but an allpowerful president congress passes the law the president enforces them if you want to know the outcome of that overreach if you want to know where congress is again the president is not on capitol hill selling those priorities he is simply down in the executive branch with a phone and a pen implementing those priorities but if you want to know what the other two branches of government think the judiciary said no and the congress said no there is no confusion about where the different branches of government are we have one branch that is saying yes that is the executive who has no lawmaking authority whatsoever we have two branches saying no the branch that makes the law which is the legislative branch and the branch that interprets the law which is the judiciary branch we are united in the noes but what we are not united on is the yeses we talk about bipartisan in this chamber it is always striking to me that what is bipartisan is the opposition to the presidential overreach that is what is bipartisan sometimes the support for it is partisan with a minority of folks supporting the president on that it is bipartisan in itsdisdain is too strong of a word but in some ways it is not strong enough it is that we owe our constituents better it is that we owe them better my voting card has my name on it but it is not mine it is borrowed from the seventh district of georgia it doesnt belong to me it belongs to 700 000 folks back home who didnt send me here to satisfy my priorities they sent me here to satisfy their priorities i dont believe that as a nation we believe the ends justify the means i hope that we dont i hope that we have not fallen so far that we now believe the constitution the rule book for america is less important than what the results are anybody involved in manufacturing knows that if you have a flawed process you are going to produce a flawed product only with a good process can you produce a good product the constitution gives us a good process when we ignore it we have a flawed process and a flawed product i will go to the presidents environmental policies i want to make it clear i represent a district that plays outside i would argue more than any other district in the country if you want folks that love clean air and clean water come down to my part of the world if you want folks who are stewards of mother earth come down to my part of the world if want folks who love green space who love parks national trailways and bikeways come down to my part of the world we love being outside we will ride a bike we will push a stroller we dont care we just want to be outside and so if the president came to me and said rob mother earth is in peril i need you to work with me to solve that problem i would be the best listener you could imagine but that is not the way the process is working in the 412 years i have been in congress the presidents clean power plan is shutting down power plants in the great state of georgia it is the position of the administration to protect mother earth we are going to close down the power plants that we have just spent billions of dollars improving to meet the last round of environmental regulation and then with those power plants closed down we are now going to spend billions more to build brandnew facilities to generate electricity i promise you that is not going to result in fewer emissions in the atmosphere than if we let these plants run out their useful life with all of the improvements that have gone upon them but we didnt get to vote on that we didnt get to vote on that that was an executive decree we have the waters of the unitedstates well when it was a bill we rejected it it is the initiative from the white house that said the framework we have had in this country for 100 years of the federal government controlling navigable waterways and the state governments controlling the other waterways is gone if a drop of water falls it is now the federal governments responsibility to regulate why because apparently we cant be trusted back in georgia to take good care of our natural resources nonsense my district sits on a continental divide we have built a billiondollar water treatment plant where we are putting the water back into our local lake cleaner than we took it out while half the districts on the other side of the continental divide we know that the chattahoochee river basin is in a water deficit so we spend beaucoup money pumping the water back up from one side of the continental divide so that we can let it go in the basin that needs the water so badly we are stewards we are not stewards with your money we are not spending somebody elses money on these projects we are spending our money on these projects because we believe in taking care of americas natural resources the president not through selling it to congress not through selling it to the american people but with a pen and the phone federalized water across the board where was the bipartisan outcry it was lacking and finally the revised ozone air quality standards if you are confused it is that we never got the last round of ozone standards implemented those still havent gone into effect yet the president has dropped a new round of ozone standards on america not because congress worked on itwe didntnot because congress passed somethingwe didntbut because the president thought it was important and he wrote the law for himself how does congress feel about this well it turns out members of this body said if this is the direction the president wants it to go let me make this pitch to congress and see if the congress agrees with the president carbon emissions capandtrade clean power plan rejected waters of the unitedstates rejected ozone standards rejected it is not that congress hasnt spoken on these issues we have we have it is not that the president doesnt know what the article i congress wants he does he just doesnt like what the article i congress decided and so he has decided to do it himself and we have been complicit in allowing that to happen it is not even we the 435 of us it is we the 320 million of us and there is going to be a price to pay for that congress is active on these issues it is not as if folks in this body dont care they care deeply we passed the reins act to say listen if the president is going to start doing some rules on his own we need to come back and review those after the fact in congress it passed 243165 we had the regulatory integrity protection act for those jurisdictions like mine where the local governments are taking such good care of our natural resources trying to protect their right to continue to protect our local natural resources it passed 261155 the ratepayer protection act said for petes sake it hasnt been 5 years since you told us to spend billions to make these power plants workable for the next generation now you are telling us we have to close these power plants that cant possibly be the right way for america to get clean energy it cant possibly be the right way to be stewards of taxpayer dollars we passed that bill 247180 the epa science advisory board act said we have got to get together on the science if we cant figure out what the facts are we are never going to agree on what the solution is so lets have a standard for what good science looks like that we can all rally together around it passed here in the house folks arent confused about where the congress is on this issue the president is not confused about where the congress is on this issue the president believes the ends justify the means article i congress passes the law article ii the white house enforces the law article ii the judiciary interprets the law well the judiciary had a chance to do a little interpreting it had a chance to look at the waters of the unitedstates and the clean water issue and the court said this this is the sixth circuit court of appeals what is of greater concern to us in balancing the harms is the burden potentially visited nationwide on governmental bodies state and federal as well as on private parties and the impact on the public in general implicated by the rules redrawing of jurisdictional lines over certain of the nations waters the court says wait a minute we are worried about the impact on america i dont want the court to be worried about the impact on america i want the court to be worried about what the law of the land is i want the congress to be worried about the impact on america i want the president to be listening to congress and enforcing the laws that congress passed it has taken the courts to say mr president you have gone a bit to too far the court goes on and says the sheer breadth of the ripple effect caused by this rules definitional changes counsel strongly in favor of maintaining the status quo for the time being it is still being litigated the court says the detrimental impact of this new rule that congress has never seen except in the form that we rejected it the damage to america is so severe we are going to issue an injunction to prevent the president from going forward it gives me no pride to have nine justices in robes running the united states of america americans elected a president to implement the law and they elected a congress to write the law we should be doing that together we found ourselves powerless in doing that asking the courts to solve that issue instead the courts go on but neither is there any indication that the integrity of the nations waters will suffer imminent injury if a new scheme is not immediately implemented they said i dont know what it is the president is trying to solve here but there is no harm coming there is time to sort this out now they mean time to sort it out in the courts what about time to sort it out in the congress mr speaker who is it who loves the waters of the unitedstates bill if they do they should come and make their pitch the president should come and make his pitch when was the last time you saw him on the tv selling the waters of the unitedstates bill mr speaker the answer is that you havent seen him on tv selling it he is not selling it he is just doing it when have you seen him selling the ozone standards the answer is that he is not selling it he is just doing it and the list goes on we have to ask him to get out there and sell it your job as president isnt just to do it your job as president is to get the congress to allow you to do it to sell the american people who will sell the congress who will change the law of the land i dont know if you know laurence tribe he is a harvard law professor in fact he was president obamas constitutional law professor i would not call him a conservative by any stretch of the word at least not in political terms but perhaps constitutionally laurence tribe says this about the presidents clean power plan he says to justify the clean power plan the epa has brazenly rewritten the history of an obscure section of the 1970 clean air act frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal i want you to follow that rationale this isnt something that has snuck up on us here in the past few weeks here in the past few months here in the past few years the president dug deep into a 45yearold law and said it appears to me we have misunderstood this law for the past 45 years 1315 we have misunderstood it and apparently 45 years ago we absolutely made an effort through congress and the white house to give the president the authority in fact the obligation to rewrite americas energy laws in this fashion nonsense nonsense the president is a constitutional law professor frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal i get the frustration with congressional inaction i get it if we had frustration meters around here mine would be ticking up near the top but my experience is the way to address that frustration isnt to take my toys and go home the way to address that frustration is to find somebody on the other side of the aisle who i think i can trust who i think i can talk to who i think i can listen to and to work together to find an answer to work together to find a solution what is absent in all of these proposals that i have listed is anyone working together to make this proposal the law of the land the only working together that is happening are folks working together to prevent these proposals from being the law of the land process matters process matters i am going to finish close to where i began i was a new congressman had just been elected 700 000 people in the great state of georgia counting on me to be their voice counting on me to succeed on their priorities right out of the gate the president says you know what i have been trying to get the people i want appointed to a board and the senate wont do what i want them to do and because the senate wont do what i want them to do i am going to do it by myself when did that become okay mr speaker we suffer from a little of that here the house wont do what i want it to do so i am going to take my toys and go home the house wont do what i want it to do so i am going to gum up the works and shut down the process the house wont do what i want it to well guess what in a representative democracy nobody does what you want him to do you have got to go out and find 51 percent of america to agree with you and that is when you get things done i do not fault the president for his policies though i disagree with him on them i fault him for implementing those policies unilaterally unconstitutionally instead of going out and selling america on them that is what is so great about this institution if you have the votes you dont have to fuss about it folks come down to the house floor gnashing of teeth tearing of clothes selfflagellation going on here on the floor on a regular basis if you have the votes you dont have to make a scene you have just got to go out and win the votes you just have to go out and win the argument if you win the argument the law will change america works america works the constitution works you just have to follow it you just have to believe in it you have to believe in the constitution you have to believe in the american people that it governs so 90 the supreme court told the white house and its entire legal team that crafted a toocutebyhalf explanation of why this was all going to be okay and roses and sunshine hunkydory 90 the court said no no that is not what the president does that is not what the white house does that is not what you are allowed to do in america regardless the supreme court says the recess appointments clause is not designed to overcome serious institutional friction we have serious institutional friction i dont bemoan this i celebrate it i think friction was part of the process it turns out the court agrees with me they go on to say it simply provides a subsidiary method for appointing officials when the senate is away during a recess hence the term recess appointments clause here as in other contextsin other contexts mr speakerare all of these other issues the court now has on their plate from executive overreach here as in another contexts friction between the branches is an inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure i am just one vote in a 435member institution but my constituents would place that one vote on the side of being the article i legislature rather than on the side of being the best republican america has ever seen my constituents would ask me to place that vote on the side of being the legislative branch that institution from which the ideas percolate that part of the unitedstates house that is closest to the american people they would ask me to pledge to be a part of this institution not the republican national committee not the national republican congressional committee not the democratic congressional campaign committee not the democratic national committee we have an amazing opportunity and a solemn obligation in this institution my commitment is to be a good listener to all the policy concerns my colleagues have on the other side of the aisle i will be a good listener i may not agree with you but i will give you a chance to sell me but we have to be united on behalf of all of our constituents back home in saying that the constitution gives only one branch the ability to write the law and that is the article i legislature when we ignore the president we do so at our own peril at our institutional peril when the president ignores the congress he does so at his own peril at executive branch institutional peril i was on the elevator with one of the great leaders of this institution mr john dingell out of michigan and he was on the elevator a young democrat climbed on the elevator with him the young democrat was complaining that he didnt have a personal relationship with the president he said i dont get to see enough of the president the president is not on capitol hill enough mr dingell said well son be careful what you wish for remember lbj we had lbj over at the library of congress a book study just this week different presidents handle their relationship with congress in different ways some are involved too much some are involved not enough but everyone is involved this is supposed to be a battle of ideas not a battle of ideologies this is supposed to be a battle of policy not a battle of partisans this is supposed to be an opportunity to succeed on behalf of folks back home and i will tell you it is an opportunity that we are losing when we unite ourselves based on red and blue as opposed to uniting ourselves based on article i and article ii i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.004957973957061768,

usmyself included and many members of this bodywho have email accounts in the cloud maybe it is google mail or yahoo mail or aol or other email accounts on their hard drives it makes sure that the

communications were different than they are today they didnt really exist as such a few professors were using a predecessor for the internet it was not a mass form of communication today with 24 7

who deserve the same right to privacy as documents in a file cabinet with the passage of the email privacy act congress will ensure that your emails that are older than 180 days are subject to the

is my colleagues come to the floor with different life experiences they come with different opinions they come with a different set of bosses the 700 000 folks that i call my boss back home in georgia i am sure have very different views than those who call themselves the boss of my friend from massachusetts but i tell you the three bills that this rule makes in ordernot that this rule declares a foregone conclusion of passage no it just makes in order for debate on the floor of this house these three bills are exactly the kind of thing that this house should be working on and i am proud to bring it today number one i dont serve on the oversight and government reform committee that is where this resolution of disapproval has come from i did last cycle i dont this cycle i have heard colleague after colleague come to the floor and defend the rights of not being fired because your sister or your daughter or your son or your brother used birth control that is outrageous i cant imagine that someone would be fired for what their sister or their brother does in terms of their reproductive health choices i agree i agree and if there is an opportunity to work together to prevent that from happeningthat is apparently happening en masse here in the district of columbiai want to be a part of it but the truth is it is not happening en masse in fact it is not happening at all it is not happening at all i do not mind being lectured by my friends to get back to the business of the people i do not mind in fact i am onboard with it every single day of the week we can start earlier and we can start later and i will be here but do not do not lecture me on getting about the business of the people and come down with story after story after story that is not what this legislation is about that is not a problem that is not something that any of us disagree on we have some legitimate disagreements on this floor and if we pass this rule we will be able to get into the nittygritty of those disagreements but we do not disagree on the freedom of family members to make their own reproductive health choices without it impacting our own employment i will say to my friend sincerely if we can find a case in the district of columbiai dont mean a case this year i dont mean a case last year i mean a case ever of that happeningseek me out as your partner and i will help you because what folks seem to miss here in this conga line of frustration is that if we reject the d c councils resolution we return d c to the law of the land as it exists when today we dont take a single right away from anybody we dont take a single freedom away from anybody we are not interested in doing that whatsoever what we are interested in doing is protecting religious freedom it turns out if you live in washington d c you might work for an institution that lobbies for life you might work for an institution that focuses on faith this is a town of ideas in the rush to pass a piece of legislationthese are not my words these are the words of vincent gray in his letter to the members of the council of the district of columbia in the rush to push this bill through the council did not take the time to protect this cathedral of freedom that we have here did not take the time to make sure that that first and most important of our constitutional freedoms was protected now the constitution is the constitution there is nothing that the district of columbia can do to undermine the constitution but they can cause a lot of problems for folks along the way this is a resolution of disapproval to prevent that from hap pening the second bill that is here h r 1732 the regulatory integrity protection act my friends suggest that we are talking about clean water in this country that this is about republicans undermining clean water i will say again as i said about the resolution of disapproval if we pass this bill we will roll the regulatory environment of clean water so far back it will be just like it is today that is what we are going to do i just want to be clear about those radical ideas that my friends on the left have suggested if we have the will in this body to pass this bill we are going to roll regulations so far back it will be exactly like it is as i am standing here today what this bill is about is preventing the regulatory overreach going forward guess what i live in gwinnett county georgia i challenge you to have a water treatment plant that does a better job than we do we have a water fountain right there where the sewage gets treated you can go ahead and press that water fountain and have yourself a drink that is how clean it is we put it back into the lake cleaner than we take it out of the lake i will not be lectured by my friends in an executive office downtown about how to clean water in the state of georgia i promise you i care more about clean water in georgia than anyone on pennsylvania avenue does we are succeeding today if we have a problem with state regulation of clean water come to me i will be your partner we will work on that together the problem is not that georgia isnt doing a good job the problem is the feds are planning to get in the way of georgia doing a good job this bill will stop it if we pass this rule we will be able to have that debate finally the bill that makes me the proudest is our concurrent budget resolution my friends have lots to say about why it is this budget doesnt balance lets be clear i believe that they are wrong but what is more important in this discussion is that my friends dont want the budget to balance we had a free and open debate on this floor we considered every budget that any member of this chamber wanted to offer every single one an interesting thing happened every republican budget that was introduced balanced within 10 years and didnt raise taxes on hardworking americans every single budget the democrats introduced never balancednot in 10 years not in 20 years not in 100 yearsand every single one raised taxes on hardworking americans by trillions of dollars trillions of dollars in new taxes and it still didnt reach balance my friends i understand we have a fundamental disagreement about how this country ought to be run and i am glad that we have that debate here in this chamber we are a deliberative body i respect the opinions of my friends i do believe there is a common ground that we can come to but this is that common ground today for years the budget wasnt even passed in the united states senate much less try to bring it together so that the house and the senate are working off a single page of music for the first time since 1991 this chamber has done its job in concert with the senate it is no small thing far from being something to be criticized it is something to be celebrated i dont know where the votes are going to be conferencing something with the senate is hard i promise you that my bosses back home in georgia have a much more conservative view of the world than many of the folks do in the united states senate but guess what i dont get everything i want every day but what i get is an opportunity to come together to build that bridge of common ground and agreement that is the agreement we have before us todaynot my ideas not democratic ideas not republican ideas but collaborative housesenate ideasa budget for the federal government for the first time in 15 years i urge all of my colleagues take a look at this rule you will be proud take a look at the work of the hardworking people in the rules committee upstairsnine republicans four democrats getting together late in the evening trying to make the rules workyou will be proud every single democratic amendment was made in order on the regulatory integrity protection act the resolution of disapproval brought exactly as the home rule act intended last used by democrats to disapprove today used by this chamber and finally that budget brought

this war then shouldnt congress at least debate whether or not to authorize it according to the national priorities project based in northampton massachusetts which is in my congressional district every single hour the taxpayers of the united states are paying 3 42 million for military actions against the islamic state 3 42 million every hour this is on top of the hundreds of billions of tax dollars spent on the first war in iraq and nearly every single penny of this war chest was borrowed money put on the national credit card provided as socalled emergency funds that dont have to be accounted for or subject to budget caps like all other funds why is it that we always seem to have plenty of money or the will to borrow all the money it takes to carry out wars but somehow we never have any money to invest in our schools our highways and water systems or our children families and communities every day every single day this congress is forced to make tough serious painful decisions to deprive our domestic economy and priorities of the resources they need to succeed but somehow there is always money for more wars well if we are going to continue to spend billions on war and if we are going to continue to tell our armed forces that we expect them to fight and die in these wars then it seems to me the least we can do is stand up and vote to authorize these wars or we should end them we owe that to the american people we owe that to our troops and their families and we owe that to the oath of office that each of us took to uphold the constitution of the united states i want to be clear mr speaker i can no longer criticize the president the pentagon or the state department when it comes to taking responsibility for this war against the islamic state in iraq and syria i may not agree with the policy but they have done their duty at every step of the way beginning on june 16 2014 the president has informed congress of his actions to send unitedstates troops to iraq and syria and to carry out military operations against the islamic state and on february 11 of this year he sent to congress the draft text of an aumf while i disagree with the policy the administration has done its job it has kept the congress informed and as military operations continue to escalate they sent an aumf to the congress for action it is this congress this house that has failed and failed miserably to carry out its duties always complaining from the sidelines the leadership of this house failed to act last year to authorize this war even as it escalated and expanded nearly every month the speaker said it wasnt the responsibility of the 113th congress to act even though the war started during its tenure no no somehow it was the responsibility of the next congress the 114th congress well the 114th congress convened on january 6 and it still hasnt done a single solitary thing to authorize the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria the speaker asserted that congress couldnt act on the war until the president sent an aumf to congress well the president did just that on february 11 and still the leadership of this house has done nothing to authorize the use of military force in iraq and syria and now the speaker is saying he wants the president to send congress another version of the aumf because he doesnt like the first one are you kidding me well i am sorry it doesnt work that way if the leadership of this house doesnt like the original text of the presidents aumf then it is the job of congress to draft an alternative report that revised aumf out of the house foreign affairs committee bring it to the floor of the house and let the members of this house debate and vote on it that is how it works if you think that the presidents aumf is too weak then you make it stronger if you think that it is too expansive then set limits on it if you are opposed to these wars then vote to bring our troops home that is what we are here to do that is what we are charged to do under the constitution and that is why members of congress get a paycheck from the american people every weekto make the hard decisions not run away from them all i ask is that the congress do its job that is the duty of this house and of the majority in charge of this houseto simply do its job to govern but instead all we witness is dithering and twiddling and complaining and whining and blaming others and the complete and total shirking of responsibility over and over and over and over again enough enough so with great reluctance and frustration representative jones and representative lee and i introduced house concurrent resolution 55 because if this house doesnt have the stomach to carry out its constitutional duty to debate and authorize this latest war then we should bring our troops home if the cowardly congress can go home each night to their families and loved ones then our brave troops should receive that same privilege doing nothing is easy and i am sad to say that war has become easy too easy but the costs in terms of blood and treasure are very very very high i urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and demand that the leadership of this house bring to the floor of this house an aumf for the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria before congress adjourns on june 26 for the fourth of july

institutional limited partners association the ilpa believes that the changes to mandatory disclosures and other requirements as proposed in h r 5424 would be counterproductive to providing

existing disclosure requirements on form pf a confidential form used by the unitedstates securities and exchange commission and other regulators to track risks in the financial system lets hear from public citizen this bill allows investment advisers to escape current safeguards designed to reduce inflated sales pitches or obfuscation of investment risks specifically investment advisers need to make sure that potential private equity investors have basic sales documents such as the company prospectus before consummating a sale investors in private funds should be accorded ample information the bill also frustrates efforts by investors to gain access to company records in socalled booksandrecords requests unite here h r 5424 is an invitation for private equity managers to make false and
