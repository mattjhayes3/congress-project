attack occurred is the reality that we in america and all other nuclear nations have failed to limit access to nuclear technologies it remains a relatively easy task for almost any nation with the desire and the money to buy nuclear reactor technology with nuclear reactor technology there is but a short step to the reprocessing facilities necessary to convert spent fuel to bombgrade material this is an especially troubling problem to acknowledge because individual states as well as the international community have tried to limit the spread of nuclear weapons almost since the nuclear age began there have been treaties agreements conferences and meetings all of which have failed to achieve this goal many questions remain about the specific character of the osirak reactor and about the israeli justification for the raid the world will probably never know if the reactor complex included the technology needed to separate bombgrade material from the reactor fuel as the israelis believe we do know that the design of the reactor and the type of fuel planned for its use provided at least the potential for producing nuclear bomb raw materials we do not know however whether a fuel separation facility was included within the plant nor whether it was iraqs intention to use the research reactor for such purposes the resolution of this controversy will come slowly if at all and it would be a mistake for us to dwell on the particulars of what happened since they are far overshadowed by the meaning of this incident for the prospects for world peace what is clear and what is important for us to learn~from the recent israeliiraqi conflict is that the worlds nuclear powers have failed miserably in their efforts to restrict the availability of nuclear weapons materials and technologies further this incident suggests that much stronger efforts toward nuclear nonproliferation are required and that nuclear supplier nations such as ourselves the soviets china france italy

interests that is simply not true the bills as reported represent a major and even radical departure from the original act and from common respect for administrative and judicial decisions in many ways it turns back the clock on the kind of reasonable regulatory reform that many of us have been working so hard to achieve we should recognize that the carefully crafted regulations which would be totally overturned without the pending amendmcnt were not written by the muchmaligned reagan epa biliby the carter epa which some of our colleagues hold up as a shining example of environmental

of a letter from the epa assistant administrator to the speaker stating the agencys intention to come up with a regulatory scheme for small generators within 3 years those plans fit very well with the pending amendments as offered by my colleague from texas and myself so the question before us is whether we are to put the epa in a legislative straitjacket or whether we are going to let reason and normal procedure prevail to come up with a workable approach to the problem of regulating small generators of hazardous waste if section 3 passes in its present form a regulatory scheme designed for large manufacturers would be inflexibly applied to thousands of smaller businesses in vastly different circumstances by any account most of the waste generated is now fully regulated the epa says 99 percent the ota says 93 4 percent in their preliminary study that is an important difference but we need to nail it down to see the magitude of the problem our amendment would allow us to do that while continuing to regulate far over 90 percent of all hazardous wastes what kinds of effects would section 3 have if passed according to the epa 130 000 small businesses would be added to the program tripling its present work load some proponents of section 3 have claimed that 700 000 businesses would be added it is hard to believe that the supporters of a clean environment would choose to divert the epas resources from the 60 000 companies that produce over 90 percent of our waste to 10 times as many who cause less that onetwentieth of the problem epa estimates that the businesses and groups that would be affected include 56 000 gas stations 14 000 auto repair garages 6 000 dry cleaners and 2 000 hospitals as well as most high schools and virtually every college and university in the nation several of the members of this body from time to time express a concern for small businesses well there is nothing worse you could do for a small business than to add a minimum of 3 000 every year to their costs yet that is what section 3 would do finally some proponents of section 3 have raised concerns about small quantities of toxic wastes yet the epa already has a 1kilogram limit for highly toxic wastes i even read about threats of kepone dumping in open landfills well let me assure my colleagues speaking from the state that made kepone a household word it is no longer manufactured in the united states and its use has been banned for many years in short section 3 represents a bludgeon approach against untold numbers of small businessmen and schools to solve a
