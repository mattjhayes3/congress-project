{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "this evening as i do each tuesday evening that the united states house of representatives is in session i rise on behalf of the 37memberstrong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition as you walk the halls of congress as you walk the halls of the cannon house office building the longworth house office building and the rayburn house office building it is easy to spot an office that belongs to one of the 37 members of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition because you will find this poster as a welcome mat by each door of a blue dog member as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 419 147 820 878 and some change your share of the national debt that is every living man woman and child including the children born today every american citizens share of the national debt is 28 134 as members of the blue dog coalition it is what we call the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot go away until this republican congress and this administration gets our nations fiscal house in order last week the president made a big announcement about how the deficit really was not as bad as what his white house had first thought and reported it would be i think the best way to sum up the events of last week can be found in an editorial july 11 2006 from the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished and i will not read the entire editorial but i think it sets the stage for what we plan the spend the next hour discussing this evening it starts off like this the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and thiscountry in fact when the social security surplus is excluded as it should be the 2006 deficit is not 296 billion it is 473 billion now throughout the evening we are going to be talking more about this including projected surpluses and how they became huge deficits i will talk more about that in a little bit but i have

to my reason to represent my hometown to craft laws and policies that will serve the best interests of the families and businesses of that community and to ensure that the world we leave behind is better than the world you and i inherited of late i think congress has forgotten that when i compare the laundry list of items important to my constituents and the american people to what congress is doing a disconnect is apparent an overwhelming majority of americans think it is long past due to increase the minimum wage over the past 6 years this congress has done little if anything to help those earning the minimum wage and the families who depend on them the buying power of the minimum wage is now at its lowest point in 57 years at the sara4 time the cost of key necessities like health care education and gas have been rising faster than inflation yet during the past 8 years members of congress have raised their own pay seven times by nearly 30 000 in those same years minimumwage workers have not gotten a single raise they continde to earn an average of 10 700 a year raising the minimum wage is a real tangible policy decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers bipartisan bill this bill would gradually raise the minimum wage from 5 15 an hour to 7 25 an hour since february nearly 200 members have signed the petition that would force and upordown vote on this measure and that is what we should have today the only reason we have not had a vote on it is because of the republican leadership they resisted the will of the american people and a bipartisan coalition of members and now that the minimum wage increase will finally be debated by the house it has once again been loaded down with poison pills if the republican leadership really cared about raising the minimum wage they would not have waited until the eleventh hour before the house leaves for recess this is a transparent electionyear ploy i am confident the american people will see it for what it is when a party holds three votes to roll back the estate tax but refuses to allow a clean vote on the minimum wage it is clear where its priorities are while raising the minimum wage will help millions of americans the estate measure will primarily benefit just 7 500 families looking at the majoritys record we should not be surprised there is the series of tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest among us the massively flawed medicare prescription drug benefit and subsidies for oil and gas companies but for those in the middle class and working families there is not much to talk about nothing to help get access to decent health care or build on the promise of stem cell research or lower the price of gas or make college more affordable at the end of today the majority certainly cannot claim to have made a good faith effort to raise the minimum wage and that is truly

in the stump speech and having the press conference with security homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in america it is in towns and it is in big cities and it is in emerging areas and it is in young people and older people that have

5year program mrs bush also announced admiral r timothy ziemer as the new unitedstates malaria coordinator i think members should be aware if they are not already that every 30 seconds an african child dies of malaria moreover about 1 2 million people die each year mostly in africa from this preventable disease the presidents malaria initiatives pmi goal is to cut malaria deaths by 50 percent in 15 african countries and hopefully to also mitigate morbidity the plan includes disseminating insecticidetreated bed nets indoor residual spraying lifesaving drugs called acts and treatment for pregnant women known as intermittent preventive treatment or ipt the money in this bill will advance this initiative and will now include four new countries let me also thank the chairman and the committee for modestly upping the amount of money to try to effectuate cures for those women suffering obstetric fistula the amount has now risen to 7 5 million my hope is and perhaps in conference we can bump that up even further to 10 million two million women suffer from this debilitating condition the result of which is incontinence i have visited hospitals in africa and seen that for a mere 150 a womans life can be given back to her through a surgical repair obviously there is also prevention but there are these 2 million women who have a fistula today and it seems to me we need to do even more to try to end their misery 1400 having met with many of these women to see the smiles on their faces having gotten their lives back going back to their villages kfiowing that they will no longer be ostracized because incontinence obviously is not just a health hazard and leads to sickness it results in very serious odor as well let me remind my colleagues that anywhere from 50 000 to 100 000 new cases occur every year and certainly if we were to increase our effort on obstetrical services especially midwives in africa such an effort would go a long way to preventing this condition when an obstructed delivery or some kind of sexual trauma causes obstetric fistula i would hope the chairman would try to increase that number even further and i thank him for what he has done"],

judiciary into an echo chamber of the right wing of this particular majority if today is anything like the typical day of the past 3 years 1ee american soldiers will die in iraq or afghanistan the taliban will get a little stronger in afghanistan and the civil war will continue to be enhanced in iraq and the american people will watch their congress do nothing but listen to a bunch of

frankly than we often hear in the united states house chamber especially by some of my good friends from the other side of the aisle we call this the official truth squad i thank the leadership and the conference for allowing me to come and share a few words tonight the official truth squad grew out of a frustration on the part of the freshmen class of the republican conference we all were elected in 2004 24 strong now 26 of us here in the united states house of representatives after a relatively few number of months we grew frustrated with the fact that there was a lot of misinformation and a lot of distortion and a lot of frankly deception that was going on here and so what we wanted to do was to put together a group of folks that would come to the house floor and try as best we could to provide some truth some facts to the situations that we address here in the united states house of representatives we have just gotten back from a week at home a district work period over the memorial day week i heard from constituent after constituent about two big issues one was illegal immigration obviously the largest issue we have to deal with as a nation right now but the second one in meeting after meeting after meeting with constituent after constituent all across my district on the north side of atlanta was people asking why on earth is congress so divided why is it so partisan why do you have the kind of sniping that goes on and i am loathe to answer that question because it is so difficult to understand why there are many in this chamber who are not interested in working positively or productively together it just boggles my mind these are not democrat problems or republican problems these are american problems and american problems deserve a united congress working together so what you have just heard in the last 15 minutes is an individual who will tell you that quote this is a republican congress problem well we do better if we work together the fact is that it is extremely difficult to get anything moving forward positively in congress without the support of many different folks and so we work better when we work together what you hear so often is what i call the politics of division the politics of division is so destructive they do a disservice to every single one of us in this nation i tried to put some words to the consequences of the politics of division and i think i have found a quote i have shared it with you before and it comes from the reverend william boetcker who was a philosopher and leader around the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century he described what he said was a social philosophy and he attributed it to abraham lincoln nobody can actually determine whether president lincoln actually said these words but reverend boetcker talked about them and i think they crystallize and capture my concern my suspicion about what the consequences are of this politics of division that is so destructive he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cant help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred and you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich now that kind of crystallizes i think what is a unifying american philosophy it is a philosophy that would serve us extremely well here in the united states house of representatives how often do you hear people just castigate out individuals who are more wealthy than others destroying the rich in an effort to build up the poor it doesnt work that way it doesnt work that way our system never has our system never has done that and so the official truth squad tries to bring some credibility and truth to these discussions we have adopted a motto which is a qubte from a wonderful united states senator daniel patrick moynihan from the state of new york and this quote i think makes it so that everybody has to be held accountable and what senator moynihan said is that everyone is entitled to their opinion and they are and opinions are here in the countless number everyones entitled to their opinion but theyre not entitled to their own facts everyones entitled to their opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts which is why it is so frankly troubling that the blue dog group gets up here night after night week after week and talks about how they want to be fiscally responsible you know we used to say that folks who were politicians that said one thing at home and did something different in washington werent being responsive to their constituents well the blue dogs have perfected the art of saying one thing in washington and doing another thing in washington and we will use some facts here are some facts you want to talk about facts during the fiscal year 2006 budget this was the plan of the blue dogs and the democrats instead of being responsible about spending they offered programs that would have spent 21 5 more billion dollars you didnt hear that from folks on the other side of the aisle that is the truth that is the truth how many in new taxes 54 billion in new taxes talk to me now about what the truth is and what is being proposed and what is being said in washington and what is being voted on in washington and what is being said back home how many mandatory savings the republican conference all on their own in a very difficult way because we got no cooperation from folks who will tell you one thing at home in fact they will tell you one thing that same thing in washington but they will do exactly the opposite we gained 40 billion this savings with the deficit reduction act earlier this year how much mandatory savings on the part of the other side zero zero that is the truth that is a fact that is not opinion that is a fact the bills that they brought forward the blue dogs my good colleague just before me talked about wanting a balanced budget we have given them an opportunity to vote on a balanced budget in fact we did so just 3 or 4 weeks ago here on the floor of the house of representatives not a single one of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that balanced budget not one they talk about making certain that you pay as you go that you only pay for programs that you have the money for we have offered that on the floor of the house we do not get the support of the blue dogs they talk about having a rainy day fund doesnt it make wonderful sense to have a rainy day fund because we know year after year after year we will have emergencies like katrina or other emergencies there is an average of 20 billion annually where there are emergencies that need federal money during the course of any given year on average 20 billion so what does the republican congress propose that we are being accused of doing in fact what we do propose is a rainy day fund in the budget that we just adopted for fiscal year 2007 how many members of the blue dog how many of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that rainy day fund not one not one same number that we got when we talk about the mandatory savings zero not one of them support it i want to talk about a little positive information about this economy because you wont you may not hear about it on the nightly news you may not read about it in your newspapers you certainly wont hear about it from some folks who want to make certain that they practice this politics of division and this politics of deception did you see the new job figures last month the month of may 75 000 new jobs created and this economy over the past 12 months has created 1 9 million new jobs 1 9 million new jobs more than 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 6 percent lower than the average of the 60s 70s 80s and 90s a picture oftentimes says it so much better than any of us can so let me see if i can show you the picture of that kind of job growth that we have seen over the past 3 years here it is on a graph here we are in january 2002 with unemployment up at about 5 7 to 8 percent here is the job growth at that time and then on the bottom we have the number of months going by we havent even gotten to this month but earlier this year what has happened to the unemployment rate it has gone down whats happened to the job growth it has gone up significantly again 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 so the curious individual the individual who wanted to solve problems and work positively and productively on behalf of the american people would say well what happened when this seemed to change when unemployment h3420 co rates began to go down when the job growth began to go up what happened what occurred there well lo and behold you know what happened we had tax decreases appropriate tax decreases responsible tax decreases by making certain that americans got to keep more of their own money and when you allow americans to keep more of their own money what happens they spend it and they save it in wise ways and then the economy flourishes so because of the tax policies of this congress of this congress and this administration we have seen increasing job growth and decreasing unemployment what else about the economy is going on revised reports show the fastest real gross domestic product growth in over 22 years in the first quarter real gdp growth grew at an annual rate of 5 3 percent in the first quarter productivity increased at an annual rate of 3 7 percent in the first quarter hourly compensation real hourly compensation rose at a 3 2 annual percentage rate in the first quarter personal income increased at an annual rate of 6 7 percent in april since january of 2001 real after tax income has risen by 12 9 percent why mr speaker because of tax policies appropriate responsible tax policies put in place by this congress this administration this leadership and oftentimes in spite of what you hear at home and in spite of what you hear by my friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes more often than not frankly without a single individual helping on that side of the aisle in fact they come down and they say these tax decreases the tax reductions will destroy the economy will throw people out on the streets but you know what happens what happens is that unemployment goes down job growth goes up and in fact sometimes they will even say that at 1 minute and then they will vote for the same thing that they just said was awful just said was awful just a moment before that truth is so doggone important in the public discourse remember you can have your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts you have got to talk about facts and that is why the official truth squad takes the opportunity as often as possible to come down here and talk about facts talk about facts with the american people because the politics of division again does a disservice to every single american we live in a glorious nation a wonderful nation a nation that is still seen by men and women around the world as a beacon of liberty and a repository of hope i am proud to serve in the united states house of representatives and to have the opportunity to share a positive productive perspective and vision with my colleagues and i hope that we can be joined by

000 constituents in delaware and probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research that is true of the figures in the country we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here they have visited my office they have visited your offices there is not a person in this room who has not had many many visits by people who have very very serious needs whose lives are going to be shortened i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases adult stem cells cannot do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do embryonic stem cell research has the ability perhaps to do much more than that people are going to get up and they are going to say well it hasnt done anything yet they were only discovered about 62 years ago if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america congress should never ever turn its back on this opportunity how are we going to get there how are we going to do embryonic stem cell research i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process they are then frozen they are generally used and well used the 400 000 embryos which are out there to help give birth to people who might not otherwise be able to have a child but at the end of the process a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo they may do a variety of things with it they may as has been discussed here give it up for adoption they may decide to have it discarded as hospital waste that is where the vast almost all of them actually go as hospital waste we want to give them the opportunity to say within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste sitting at that table to be put over here and the state to be able to do the research that is what we need to do we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind i rise today im support of h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career ijust like all of youhave had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded and the 820 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility i am their voice in the congress of the united states some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research and frankly the answer is simplethose 800 000 constituents we estimated that aboutonehalf of all visits to my office are about health care and about onehalf of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are sufferingfrom juvenile diabetes alzheimers cancer parkinsons hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican partys drive to double funding for the nih and that funding has gone toward the basic science needed to find cures and treatments to our most debilitating diseases but in the past few years the number one topic on these groups minds was embryonic stem cell research one little girl stands out in mind i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware olivia was two months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking olivia is now 6 and has never known life without diabetes she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns at the time the compromiseto allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derivedseemed quite reasonable but as we know unfortunately the number of lines eligible for research once as high as 78is now only at 22 with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the presidents policy in an ethical manner i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy the legislation we are going to vote on today h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act which has the backing of the medical groups the scientists the research universities and the patient advocacy groups mirrors the presidents ethical requirements i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely 1 embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need 2 the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded and 3 the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement you may ask what is differentwe simply lift the arbitrary august 9 2001 date it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do 1 no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life this is prohibited by law 2 no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research under our legislation it is up to the couple to decide what should happen to their embryos embryos can be adopted or donated embryos can be frozen for future family building embryos can be discarded after that initial decision is made and if a couple decides to discard the embryos our legislation would allow those couples to make a second choice do they want to donate them to research an embryo or blastocyst is about 250 cells and the inner cell mass is about 100 cells and that is where the stem cells come from they are created in a petri dish are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head of the 400 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the unitedstates about 2 percent are discarded annuallythat is about 8 00011 000 embryos that could be slated for research allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another persons life the bottom line is when a couple has decided to discard their excess embryos they are either going to be discarded as medical waste or they can be donated for research throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists this is simply not true umbilical cord cells are adult stem cells and they are limited adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are they are difficult to harvest and grow and they do not exist for every tissue type on the other hand embryonic stem cells are master cells they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body they are easier to identify isolate purify and grow and they are capable of cpntinual reproduction listen to what the nih has to say on this topic human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotentthat is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotentrestricted to specific subpopulations of cell types as adult stem cells are thought to be in 2003 1 6 million people died of heart disease cancer diabetes alzheimers kidney disease liver disease and parkinsons of the 15 leading causes of death adult stem cell research only addresses one adult stem cells have been around since the 1960s embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998 we must explore research on all types of stem cells but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy the nih is the right place to oversee this research because it can regulate the ethics it provides for scientific collaboration and peer review and promotes publication so all breakthroughs are reported and all scientists have access to the latest research discoveries without nih oversight there are no guidelines as to how this research should be conducted the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world as science continues to move rapidly forward we need to continue to lead the way but we are not why should we waste one more year one more day forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable does this congress really want to look back 10 years from now and say that we were the ones holding the treatments up or do we want to be the congress that says we back science we want research to flourish and we played a small role in making that happen support h r 810 the

and they should have to fix it the mtbe industry says it was forced to put mtbe in gasoline by the clean air act amendments of 1990 there is no mtbe mandate in that law even the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce has acknowledged that industry representatives have testified before congress that mtbe has been widely used since 1979 this is an arco circular from around the 1980s urging refiners to add mtbe by the time of the 1990 clean air amendments the industry had already added 120 million barrels of mtbe to gasoline even more damning are the documents unearthed in recent court cases proving conclusively that the industry knew as early as the 1980s about the dangers mtbe posed to groundwater it still went on adding it to gasoline the special protection for mtbe manufacturers is in this bill because they are finally being taken to task for the damages they knowingly caused recent court cases regarding responsibility for mtbe groundwater contamination have come down on the side of local water companies and cities these cases have forced manufacturers to pay to clean up or replace mtbecontaminated water supplies the most celebrated has been the 60 million settlement for south lake tahoe and the nearly 400 million for santa monica in my district the tiny little coastal town of cambria had one of its two drinking water sources permanently damaged by mtbe after it sued cambria was able to get chevron to pay a 9 million settlement to help the town to build a desalinization plant but under this bill the taxpayers of cambria and of hundreds of towns large and small across this country would be forced to pay for the mtbe cleanup on their own the gentleman from massachusetts is right to raise this point of order we should support the point of

would not be supported i deeply regret this there is in this bill a very good set of provisions in general expanding the ability of the fha to be responsive it came from work we did in the authorizing committee frankly i was surprised to see it plucked in part from the authorizing version and stuck into this bill it is authorizing language on the whole it is a good thing the appropriations committee took from the authorizing committee much of what we did but they did not take everything now they are entitled obviously to pick and choose but there is one grave omission here one of the things this bill will do will be to give the fha the authority the ability to extend loans to people who might be of lower credit risk that is it will try to help get to people who might not have been able to get loans by stricter standards that is a good thing and it says that those people will have to pay a higher upfront fee it could be as much as double from 1 5 percent to 3 percent of the loan and they will also be forced to pay a higher fee going forward with people who are just starting out i will accept the need to do that what my amendment would have accomplished and it was something we were ready to do in the authorizing process and we lost the ability to do that it was to say that a low income borrower a borrower with some credit risk who was meeting his or her obligations after a period of 5 years would be eligible to get babk the extra money in other words without that provision the federal government is going to be something of a predatory lender it will lend money to the lower income people with the higher credit risk and charge them more for that loan now as a starting point that might be a reasonable idea but once a borrower in that category having borrowed the money has demonstrated over 5 years a capacity and willingness to make the payments why does the federal government continue to penalize that person people have said well there might be some losses here if there are losses why should the responsible low income borrower be forced to bear all that cost why should that not be shared among all the borrowers why should the cost of paying for those loans that may default a small percentage but there will still be some why should that not go for everybody so right now if you are getting the maximum fha loan it is irrelevant to you if these people default we are making the poor pay for the poor you are making in this a predatory lender of the federal government without the amendment that i was told would not be accepted so i will not push it here low income people who borrow money from the fha will be charged more upfront they will be charged more going forward and no matter how well they meet their obligations no matter how responsible they are they will continue to pay more for the loan the poor pay more under this bill and what the cbo said as well there is a certain element of subsidy here for the low income borrowers and this would increase the subsidy that is right for the low income borrowers i do think it is worth to trying to reach out to the lower income people and i understand this means that some will default but i do not understand why one low income individual or 10 or 20 low income individuals who meet their obligation ought to be the ones who bear the burden for those who do not now as i said i understand because cbo said it was going to score it negatively i was not going to be able to get it adopted but i hope to the committee that this will not be the end of it please we are talking about ending predatory lending without the language i was talking about we the federal government become an entity that charges you more if you are poor than if you are wealthy that charges you more if you are in the low income bracket because you are asked to shoulder the burden of people in the same bracket who will default that is unworthy of us it also of course retards the very purpose of the bill because you say you want to expand home ownership by reaching out to people and then you charge them more because they have to pay not only the price of their own home but they are going to be saddled with the pice of other people in their income level and their credit rating level who default that is an inappropriate thing for the federal government to do and while i accept the fact that i cannot get this accepted now i hope we can talk about this by the way the overall bill will raise money for the federal1 government this would simply reduce it by a small amount that is the least we can do for

honor the achievements and successes of catholic schools throughout the unitedstates more than 2 4 million children are enrolled in the 7 799 catholic schools in our country in addition 720 000 students are enrolled in the 212 catholic colleges and universities nationwide in my home state of new jersey 129 232 students are enrolled in catholic schools in fact new jersey has the sixth largest enrollment of students in catholic schools out of all 50 states of course children do not form their core values on the sole basis of what schools teach them learning a respect for life and respect for the rights of others is not the purview of schools alone it begins and is nurtured in the home accordingly the catholic school curriculum recognizes parents and family as primary educators and seeks to foster a shared vision between the school and family as the father of four children who have attended catholic schools i know that catholic school educators strive to work handinhand reinforcing family values ethical behavior social responsibility and academic achievement placing a premium on both academic standards and moral responsibility has proven to be a successful formula for catholic schools catholic secondary schools have a 99 percent graduation rate and moreover 97 percent of graduates continue their education learning in a religious setting is not for everyone and americas public school system is critical to providing educational opportunities for all we must continue to vigorously support our public schools at both the federal and local levels at the same time however we should support those who seek the benefits of catholic school and choose a religious setting as the best educational environment for their children the contribution of catholic schools to our nation extends beyond the classroom catholic elementary and secondary schools save the government and taxpayers of the u s up to 20 billion a year hi79 in effect parents of catholic school

significantly the tax credit is used for private school tuition however it can also be used for other educational needs such as computers tutoring or transportation fees thus parents sending their children to public school tcan also benefit from this legislation a catholic education challenges students through a combination of high standards strong motivation effective discipline and an

seen the devastation in the wake of the tsunami in indonesia i feel that aid to the victims is critical nevertheless i am disgusted by the process by which this legislation came to the floor and by

it our nations top accountant said that the year 2004 was arguably theworst year in our fiscal history that says a lot that is a big statement that includes the great depression that includes all the world wars the civil war how on earth could 2004 have been arguably the worse year in our fiscal history because in that one year congress promised 13 trillion worth of future spending that is completely unpaid for never in american history has congress been that irresponsible and that is why our nations top accountant made that declaration about 2004 we will look at some future years the debt that we are running up that our colleagues have explained so well is going to cost us so much in ifiterest that by about the last year of the bush administration we will be spending more money on interest payments to our nations creditors than we will be on regular domestic government in america in a sense it will be a better deal to be a creditor of this country than to be a citizen of this country because the creditors will be getting more money than we will be if we look at regular nondefense disctetionary spending let us look at another key date in our future this was in the wall street journal at the rate that foreigners are lending us money buying our debt by february 9 2012 the chinese will have bought the last bond from a unitedstates citizen and then they will own all of our foreign debt their pace of buying our debt of loaning us money of getting us dependent on their credit is so ravenous that just a few short years from now they will own all the foreign debt if current trends continue look at another key date by the year 2017 that will be the first honest picture of the deficit in american history because today the true size of the deficit is being disguised by the social security surplus last year people like to say the deficit was 412 billion well the true deficit was 567 billion because 155 billion of social security surplus was used to disguise the true size of the deficit we owe that money to social security recipients that is one of the most solemn obligations our country has ever made and yet people never mention the true size of the deficit well by 2017 there will not be a surplus anymore and then the true deficit will be revealed look at the year 2035 a reputable group standard poors they rate all of the debt in corporate america all the debt in the world they are predicting that the unitedstates treasury bond by that year will achieve junk bond status if that is not a dire warning i do not know what is because the unitedstates treasury obligation is the soundest obligation on this earth we have always paid our debts as a nation that is the gold standard of bonds but here is standard poors the most reputable private sector debtrating organization saying that if current trends continue out bonds will be junk bond status look at the final date on here i think it is 2040 that is when again our nations top accountant says that it will take all revenues collected by the federal government to do one thing every penny collected from federal income tax federal corporate tax all the other taxes to do one thing what service the debt pay our creditors interest alone there will not be one red cent left for any national de fense for any social security for any medicare for any anything that is not my prediction that is our nations top accountant that is the sort of fiscal hole that these numbers that my colleagues have revealed are leading us into this is a problem this is a true crisis i have called this the road to ruin that is what it is we have to change course let me show my colleagues this a lot of folks say well 9 11 did all this what people do not realize is the cato institute revealed in a recent study that president george w bush and the republican congress are the biggest domestic spenders nondefense spending since lyndon baines johnson the title of the report is called the grand old spending party how the republicans became the party of big government and this graph shows it one might think that some previous democratic presidents were big spenders but look at this carter and clinton they are down toward the bottom lyndon johnson did try to give us a gunsandbutter budget but only president george w bush has approached him in terms of growth of domestic spending these are the true numbers this is what the american people need to focus on we have a dire deficit situation and we need action so i appreciate the gentleman my good friend from south carolina holding this special
