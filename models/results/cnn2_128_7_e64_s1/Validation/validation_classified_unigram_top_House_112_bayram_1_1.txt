spending thats a reduction of 2 1 billion below last year 3 8 billion below the presidents request some have complained that these cuts are too much too fast but its important to remember that these agencies and programs have seen unprecedented massive increases in spending in recent years this sort of excess has contributed to our astronomical debt and is threatening our recovery we simply cant fund unnecessary and ineffective programs when we are borrowing 42 cents on every dollar we spend we just simply cant afford it this legislation makes smart significant cuts across each and every agency funded by this bill the bill still adequately funds the agencies that are important to the health of our citizens the stability of our economy and the preservation of our environment but weve made some priority adjustments in areas that can and should withstand lower budgets some areas that will see bigger reductions include climate change programs which are trimmed 22 percent from last year and land acquisition funding which is at a level nearly 79 percent lower than last year frankly many of the cuts in this bill are just plain common sense particularly when it comes to the environmental protection agency the reductions and provisions in this bill were made with very good reasonto rein in unparalleled outofcontrol spending and jobkilling overregulation by the epa though

the past months but particularly during this week as we approach the question about what are we going to do with funding the remainder of this year there of course was no budget decided on last year and so they do a thing called a continuing resolution so theres a lot of discussion as to how much can we be affording to spend of the taxpayers dollar and i thought that it might be appropriate this evening to take a look at that not so much in a lot of minuscule detail but at the magnitude of the overall question thats before us and how the math just doesnt work i will also try as we have a chance to get into a discussion this evening to connect it to the problem of unemployment because all of these things are connected and still i think its helpful to look from an overall perspective so what i have here is one of thosewe always have these pie charts i particularly like pie and this particular pie chart here shows some different areas of the federal budget now this is the total of federal spending here and the pieces of pie are roughly proportional what i would like to start with this evening so we have a big picture of how serious the excessive spending in the federal government is is to start by making a distinction between a couple of types of spending the first kind of spendingand maybe to some people this sounds like sort of washington d c talk but they call it mandatory spending or entitlements and mandatory spending may be not necessarily mandatory but what that means is that legislators maybe as much as 50 years ago passed a series of laws and those laws then automatically spit out dollar bills out of the treasury so anytime somebody who happens to be the right person waves their hand in front of the little machine out pops a dollar bill and so we have these things and theyre called entitlements or mandatory spending so these are places where the federal government just is automatically spending money and there are some of them that are very familiar with most people social security here medicare and medicaid those are the three big as they call it entitlements or mandatory spending there are other entitlements that are smaller and thats in this category over here the other quote mandatory spending so these are not medicare or medicaid social security but they are the other mandatory and then theres another thing that acts just about like mandatory spending and that is the interest on our debt when the treasury decides to sell a treasury bill the reason people buy a treasury bill is because it is going to pay some interest to them so we have to pay the interest on our debt and in that sense when we decide to spend money that we dont have we are creating what is in essence like a little machine that spits out dollar bills lets say that you take all of this mandatory spending or entitlement spending and add it to the interest on the debt how much does that add up to it adds up to about 2 3 trillion for this year now what in the world does 2 3 trillion mean most of us dont have a good sense of perspective well 2 3 trillion happens to be the revenue that the federal government collects this year in other words what were saying is if you take this purple and this aqua color and this gold color and light and dark blue here you add this all together this is equal to the revenue that comes in for the federal government what then does that leave out well it leaves out these two other pieces of pie one is defense and one is nondefense theyre called discretionary because each year we decide how much money youre going to spend in those categories so what were saying isand i think this is really chillingit sounds maybe a little boring to explain it but just think about this a little bit the entitlements and the debt service equals our revenue that means if we want to balance the budget this year what we would have to do would be to get rid of all of defense not one soldier not one plane not one tank not one ship nothing there would be nothing in defense and nothing in the nondefense discretionary no department of energy no department of commerce no department of education there would be no park service there would be no prisons there would be no homeland security there are all kinds of things that the federal government does that we fund every year which would be gone so there would be no defense and no nondefense discretionary well the country wouldnt survive very well under those conditions so thats the problem these entitlements have grown so much that they have eaten up the whole budget now this week were going to be debating how were going to cut this nondefense discretionary cutting a little bit from defense but mostly nondefense discretionary and were talking about 100 billion is that a lot of money sure its a lot of money is it a lot of money compared to the fact that were about 1 3 trillion or 1 5 trillion over not so much then when you compare 100 billion to about 1 5 trillion i am joined tonight by a good friend of mine a freshman congressman from arizona paul gosar we had a chance to talk about this a little bit last week and i invite you to jump in because what i hope that people are starting to understand here is that we have got a big financial problem down here our entitlements and debt service is equal to how much revenue we take in and thats assuming you have zero for defense and zero for this other nondefense discretionary i mean there is no money to run the government with that is a fairly significant problem lets talk about it my friend"],

are arguments on both sides of the issue should we transfer the frigates to turkey at no cost a gift from the american taxpayer should we condition that transfer should we limit it to perhaps only one ship id like to have hearings id like congress to work its will instead a bill is brought to the floor on a day we were not scheduled to be in session for a lastminute discussion and a lastminute vote in prior discussions in our committee dealing with providing frigates to turkey weve been told that turkey lives in a dangerous neighborhood that it shares a border with iran i would ask where on the turkishiranian border will these frigates be deployed the last time an oceangoing vessel has been seen in eastern anatolia it was noahs ark now these frigates will be deployed in the mediterranean and weve seen what the turkish navy does in the mediterranean in 1974 there was the invasion of cyprus more recently there are the actions taken against israel and in support of hamas in june of 2010 after a gaza flotilla attempted to aid the terrorist group hamas with supplies turkey threatened to send armed naval escorts to back another aid convoy to hamas the turkish prime minister erdogan called for israel to be punished for interfering with the previous effort to aid hamas with the flotilla in september 2011 after a u n report on the gaza flotilla was released turkey threatened to send an armed naval presence to the eastern mediterranean to confront israel and prime minister erdogan said that israel should expect more naval presence from turkey in the area and i quote turkish warships will be tasked with protecting the turkish boats bringing aid to harnas in the gaza strip the gentleman from new york pointed out how the turkish navy has interfered with both the cypriot and israeli efforts to exploit natural gas deposits on the seabed between those two countries this is particularly outrageous when you realize that the cypriot natural gas fields are off the shores of south cyprus an area where turkey has not tried to assert its military presence and theyve gone further and even interfered with israel exploiting its own natural gas fields off of its coast this is the action of the turkish navy in the mediterranean is this something that we should be furthering by two free frigates i dont know we havent had hearings we havent had a markup we havent had a discussion on what limitations what conditions and what quantity of ships should be transferred ive come to this floor on over 100 occasions to vote on suspension bills renaming post offices most of those bills were subject to a markup in the appropriate committee shouldnt we give that same level of attention to the transfer of frigates to turkey send this bill back to committee let us have a real discussion let us follow the rules not suspend the rules when were dealing with a matter of this importance to our foreign policy in the eastern mediterranean"], [0.9672287106513977,

the decibels and that we talk about facts this is an issue where passions are very high but i think its important to bring down the decibels a little bit and speak about some of the facts look we know that america is home to some of the best universities on the planet and because of that people from around the world students from around the world young people from around the world come to study in our universities then unfortunately when theyre done we in essence show them the door out and they have to leave the country and they leave the country then and become the best the toughest

issue it tries to keep those individuals here those are the facts now i would like to see a large number of that and i think all of us should be talking about maybe we can expand those numbers and that i think would be a wonderful debate to have now not only does this bill do that but it also promotes a smarter immigration system that helps maintain our competitive edge and it also helps keep families together ensuring that spouses and minor children remain together is simply the right thing to do is it not is that not something that is a compassionate principle of the vast majority of the members of the house keeping families together of course it is this bill helps to do that weve heard a lot of blame on this issue on the floor today and frankly for years and on immigration reform and everybody knows my position on immigration reform it has been talked about for years with a lot of inflammatory rhetoric and i will tell you from republicans and democrats alike the reality is that both sides are to blame for the broken immigration system that we currently have and both sides need to come togetherfinally lowering the rhetoricto find lasting permanent solutions this bill is an important step in the right direction it helps address and fix a very important part of the broken immigration system it does not solve all the problems it is not the panacea it does not solve all the problems but it takes a huge step in an area that weve been talking about in the house here for yearsand both republicans and democrats have failed to deal with this bill deals with that important part so im glad this legislation is finally being considered by this body i commend the house leadership for their commitment to this issue and i look forward to continuing to bring other issues other issues to fix our grossly broken immigration system that is broken from a to z i look forward to bringing other issues but in order to do so we need to lower the decibels we need to talk about the facts the american people want us to finally fix this issue they want us to come up with real solutions as i mentioned before nobodys claiming that this fixes everything but its a step in the right

and constitutional reasons the exportimport bank is a prime example of corporate welfare taking money from american taxpayers to prop up the export businesses of large corporations companies such as boeing should be able to make sales based solely on the quality of their products and the willingness of the market to purchase those products instead these companies rely on their political connections to subsidize their businesses exim even provided enron with hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance before that companys ignominious collapse do we really want to continue funding the enrons of the world not only is it bad economics to force working americans small businesses and entrepreneurs to subsidize the exports of large corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens and use it to benefit powerful special interests it is for these reasons that i

create good jobs we have the sad report of 380 000 people who fell off the rolls even looking for jobs we have literally millions of our fellow americans who are looking for jobs and we have many

korea trade agreements there were members on both sides of the aisle who stood up and argued in behalf of those great agreementswe now have before us what i believe is an absolute nobrainer but

comply with a rulesbased trading system we know that once they enter the wto there are constraints imposed on them along with the benefits that they get for their membership in the wto and there was a lot of negotiation a lot of talk about russias entry into the world trade organization the idea of seeing russia forced to comply with a system that would prevent them from engaging in discriminatory practices from engaging in the kinds of acts that prevent products and services from getting into their country the structure of having to comply with a rulesbased system is something that membership in the wto forces and creates again there were a lot of negotiations the last was dealing with a border dispute with georgia that was resolved and that was resolved several months ago that put into
