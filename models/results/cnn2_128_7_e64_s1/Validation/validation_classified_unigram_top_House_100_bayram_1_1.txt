associated with the interdiction of drugs smuggled by air h r 4844 is identical to the aviation provisions of title viii of the omnibus drug legisation which was passed by the house on septembor 7 these aviationrelated provisions have strong support on both side of the aisle and are noncontroversial over the past year the committee on public works and transportation has conducted an indepth investigation into what the federal aviation administration could do to better assist the drug interdiction and enforcement efforts of local state and federal authorities what this investigation revealed was that the faas system of registering aircraft and certificating pilots should be changed in order to make the false registration of aircraft more difficult it is also clear that there is need to improve the faas information of pilots and aircraft ownership to facilitate investigations of and legal actions against drug smugglers when drug enforcement authorities learn that a particular aircraft is being used in drug smuggling activities it is sometimes difficult or impossible to discover the identity of the true owners the difficulty is cause by the ease with which the faas aircraft registration and pilot certification requirements can be circumvented by smugglers in addition there are some significant holes in the faas system of registering aircraft and pilots even when a pilot or owner is acting in good faith the faas registration system is adequate to its purposes of recording liens on aircraft however it is not well suited to assisting in drug interdiction and enforcement h r 4844 directs the faa to initiate a rulemaking to reform the registration of aircraft and pilots so that the records on pilots and aircraft ownership will be as accurate and reliable as possible

resolution congress has approved similar resolutions for the past 6 years to recognize the valuable services of home care programs and personnel and i look forward to congressional passage once again as you all know thousands of home care agencies around the nation have responded to the need to offer effective alternatives to our health care delivery system by providing skilled medical assistance to those who can be properly treated outside the hospital or nursing home setting these agencies recognize the demand for new health care options and conserve tax dollars currently expended on needless placement in these institutions this valuable concept of care provides a serviceable answer to the needs of our health care system and offers a comforting dignified environment for patients alternatives to our health care programs must be offered and home care agencies have proven very effective in answering that need as you know one of the most critical issues to face our nation today centers around our health care system while the growing elderly population expected to total well over 30 million by the year 2000 places greater demand on our current system home care agencies have helped many of the elderly remain at home and in their communities this creates an atmosphere of greater independence and dignity and promotes an easeful recovery for this service home care agencies

of the individual receiving these services whereas since the enactment of the medicare home care program which provides coverage for skilled nursing services physical therapy speech therapy social services occupational therapy and home health aide services the number of home care agencies in the united states providing these services has increased from fewer than 500 to more than 3 000 and

institutionalized to receive these services now therfore be it resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the week beginning

want them to do with their money hold it in their countries build more infrastructure in their countries take that money out of the united states or maybe instead of investing maybe they should just hold the debt of america maybe that is the better thing for them to do so they can take it out at a moments notice when they invest in america they make a commitment to america they cannot easily take that money out they cannot pick up a factory they cannot pick up a new port as easily as they can wire somebody within 30 seconds to say that they want to sell off a debt they happen to own this is

washington and the other members from both sides of the aisle whove provided such strong leadership on this issue the past several years i wholeheartedly endorse the efforts to force compliance with salt ii its in our best interest as a nation and as leader of the free world there are several reasons to support this amendment first the salt limits have clearly restrained the growth in soviet forces to date theyve been forced to destroy over 1 300 delivery vehicles in order to maintain compliance moreover the soviets are better equipped than we are to take immediate advantage of noncompliance they could produce and deploy more easily and at a faster pace if the arms race were unrestrained but perhaps most important our nato allies strongly disapprove of our recent action exceeding the treaty limits our credibility in international circles is low enough these daysthe last thing we need is more condemnation from our allies we all know that a key element of the soviet strategy is to divide western europe and the united states and frankly weve been losing the propaganda war by a long shot the western world must respond with one voice a united voice and that means compliance with salt ii i know the opponents of the amendment argue that the soviets cant be trusted that theyve violated salt ii and every other agreement theyve signed thats true but this amendment leaves us free to respond to those violations we deal only with the numerical sublimits of the treaty i dont trust the russians either but theres no evidence that theyve violated the sublimits thats all were dealing with in this legislation there are other reasons to vote aye today this house can and should be proud of its record on arms control weve had nothing but a positive impact on united statessoviet relations the administration is once again crying wolf dont tie our hands they say the president needs flexibility of course he needs flexibility and this amendment gives it to him it does nothing to limit his options at geneva suggestions to the contrary are merely propaganda from those in this country who dont support arms control under any circumstances for 7 years this house has sought to put pressure on an administration that took office in strong opposition to reaching an agreement with the soviets weve kept that pressure on and today a trillion dollars later ronald reagan stands ready to reach a historical agreement we welcome the presidents change of heart we take comfort in the knowledge that our bipartisan efforts have improved the climate for arms control and of course theres no doubt that the american people support salt ii and a reagangorbachev agreement and they want one now i believe president reagan is in a better position today than any of his wouldbe successors will be tomorrow to sign a treaty that the congress will support and that our friends and enemies around the world will respect but time is short it wont be easy to iron out the details of a treaty make plans for a summit and then proceed with senate ratification before the president leaves office next year so we need to act now and now is not the time for the house to waiver our actions the past 7 years have helped lead us to this historic opportunity this is a reasonable amendment it leaves us in a position to respond to known soviet violations and it also leaves us free to develop the midgetman theres only one alternative to this amendment and thats the arms race we cant afford that in any respect today so i urge my colleagues to support the amendment and in so doing

several of my very distingulshed colleagues of the subcommittee on housing and community development which i have the honor of chairing messrs kennedy garcia hubard flake ms pelosi and m taaficant as cosponsors so today i would entitle the remarks that i wish to address to my colleagues as they leave for the july 4 district work periodand i hope will give careful study and reading to the record when it is printed tonight becausa i believe it is the first of several programs that i will be offeringthis one i would call a bill of rights for the american homeowner and leaseholder or renter america has had very serious and vast transformations in what the students of the subject matter call demographics that is compared to three four decades ago our families are much smaller the population of our country has increased quite a bit geometrically since the 1930s and the initiation then of the programs that the national leaders and congress got together to meet the crisis of that day unfortunately for us it seems as if we have to wait here until the crisis is on us and we are floundering and hopefully that will not happen but i am afraid as i have spoken previously in the remarks i have entitled my advice to the privileged orders well i finished that which was a course of discussion for at least 21 2 years mostly it was outlining as has not been done in discussion or debate the very braic fundamental challenges american society has confronted since its founding it is ironic as i have said previously in these advice to the special or privileged classes that here as we are about to celebrate the 200th anniversary next year in march 1989 this form of government that is the constitution which is the fundamental law of the land which sets forth the governmental structure we have not celebrated 200 years yet we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the declaration of independence the struggle of the revolutionary war in 1976 but since then and last year i am afraid so many of us thought that celebrating the writing of the constitution was equivalent with celebrating the bicentetmial of our government and that is not so the constitution was finally completed in september 1787 but then it took some time to sell it to the majority of the states or the colonies and by the time it was ready to be implemented it was not until march 3 only god and destiny can tell us whether we will be able and fortunate enough to say on march 3 1989 next year that we can still boastfully say that the system is operated as we have always conceived it to be we have grave dangers some of them glossed over but which inescapably we will have to confront that go to the heart of the matter that is whether our system based on a balancing of powers is really going to survive so today the real question is whether we in our time will have the faith in the american people as those leaders in congress did during the grave emergencies of the denression and war and up to now i am afraid we have become fat and complacent and in many ways arrogant this as i have said in my remarks addressing generally the extent size variety and complexity of these problems is what shakespeare wrote all about when he said when a people become complacent and proud and arrogant and the gods seal their eyes to their defects they soon are unk in their processes of destruction and in his words strutting laughing at by those watching these proud and arrogant complacent people strut it is true that prosperity and wellbeing do tend to make a people forget the struggles and ardor of those struggles that gained them liberty and selfgovernment the 20th century has been hostile to selfgovernment not friendly yet we survive but only because the people were faithfully led and it was faith and the discharge of that faith mutually by those people elected as their agents which under our system is the vital part if it is functioning and to the extent it does not function to that extent we are in serious trouble to that extent we have become victims of the consequences of these misgotten and foolish leaders demagogic and ignorant and blissfully unaware of the limitations of the powers the constitution sets forth but to which congresses have rather complacently sometimes supinely submitted without challenge and this means that that faith is not being kept by the agents of the people who as they are under the constitution are the source of all power so as i say this is the time to have a bill of rights for the american homeowner that means the spinal column of our country the vital essence of our society the newly married couple that decides to have their own little nest and have their family that is the bulwark of our strength but in the last 6 years it has become an empty dream we have brought these things out in endless hearings that we have had here in washington and also in historic hearings pioneering hearings out in the field in the country and in the densely urbanized areas of our country from the south bronx to philadel phia and south to our nations capital and then from detroit to california where we find a newer land a newer people so to speak and they confront a different set of problems but nevertheless just as vexing and complex in their extent as those facing the older sections of our country and the older housing stocks but around our ears more than housing is collapsing around us because a house does not stand isolated and alone it has to have a water supply drainage sewage and streets that is what is known as the infrastructure and that is collapsing around our ears i have reminded my colleagues on this subcommittee that we cannot talk just about housing this is all we have been doing but we have got to remember that we should not forget that other half of the descriptive phrase of our subcommittee and that is comminity development every day in the city of new york this vast steaming metropolis more water is wasted each day than is consumed this is the precious substance that is the essence of lifewater why is that well partly because they have such outmoded systems as wooden pipes or delivery systems so they are having a tremendous waste the resources of the city of new york alone are inadequate to confront that problem every other day in our country a bridge collapses when it happens out in some outoftheway place nobody cares that it happens in new york city when it is a very vital link in transportation yes we care but what are the resources of those entities that try to firm up this infrastructure that is crumbling around our ears we have had five communities all in new england that have had their water systems collapse overnight this is happening at a time when the federal administration in power withdraws the commitment the federal government has to such things as this were it not for our subcommittee and the majority members of both the house and the senate most of the time the presidents budget since the beginning in 1981 would have zeroed everything out as they have done in housing for instance this administration has reduced by 80 percent the allocation of credit for housing or assisted housing as we call it well we cannot have a nation that is still dynamic and still growing straitjacketed and not expect to have problems so today i have introduced what will be known as h r 4959 which in effect will reaffirm our commitment to a national housing promise i started to say that just about 01 percent of our american families today can afford to buy a new singlefamily dwelling unit the average national index of cost is so prohibitive that no more than 61 2 percent of the american people can afford to buy a brandnew spanking newly constructed home this is not good we have now as our subcommittee first pointed out on december 4 1982 a considerable segment of our american people rootless homeless and wandering our country as refugees do in other lands that is not allowable for us in america but what is the reason for this well i brought this out before in an endless number of specific remarks that i have made showing the root causes the development of these causes and their contributing factors as to why we got to this point why is it that as of 3 a years ago america is a debtor nation for the first time since 1914 it is basically for the same reason that for a substantial number of americans we are houseless and homeless there was a time when we had presidents who cared we had franklin roosevelt at the height of the depression when everybody was broke and the treasury was broke and yet he and the congresses had faith in the american people that is the backbone of the american people the home occupant the homeowner a little family trying to hold itself together the only thing that anchors down a family to its country and its soil is a home now what did they do did they say oh well no we cant do it because of the budget deficiency did they say no we cant do that no they started such programs as the holc the home owners loan corporation and they heard then the same voices we are hearing now from those who are in power today saying you cant do that because it will be abused it is a waste of money and you dont have the money what are you going to do lend borrowed money no they went on ahead and did it and when the program closed out the bulk of the american families that owned homes that were threatened with foreclosure saved their homes ard when the program closed out at just about the time the war was going to break out it brought in 400 million to the unitedstates treasury now 400 million in 1940 would be like several billion today this was what having faith in that substantial strength of america meant today we have seen what happened with the federal reserve board and its previous chairman when i introduced an impeachment resolution against him i had a lot of criticism and everybody thought i was publicity seeking well i was in dead earnest because the substance of america had been sold down the river for which we arc paying now and for which we still have to get the full bill of accounting but when i saw that this same powerful chairman who was going to dictate the fiscal and monetary policies and therefore the economic policy of the congress met in secret with the head of the first national city bank of new york walter wriston and h l bunker hunt the billionaire from texas who thought he was so smart that by using over 35 billion dollars worth of lank credit allocations he could go over and compete with those old european speculators and corner the silver market and he lost his pants and all that bank crediti knew something was going to iappen they had that secret meeting the banks met to see how they could rescue him they were willing to allocate as they continue to do vast segments of amerlean credit resources banking resources everybody has forgotten what banks are the congresses are not here to do the bidding of the bankers but one would not think so sitting in on the hearings of the banking committee and other places banks are chartered or are supposed to be for public need and convenience but they have become the most powerful entities in our society they determine our coinage i have brought that out before in this bill h r 4959 i am saying all this and the descriptive introductory clause of the bill is this to establish a national housing trust to assist firsttime home buyers now what do we mean by firsttime home buyers and how do we define them we set up this trust and how is it going to be administered well we are not going to have the federal reserve board as members of the trust of the secretary of hud under whose aegis we would have it administered through fha we will have the savings and loan institutions that are today as dead as a doornail at risk right now is the insurance fund not only for the s ls but for the banks too because fdic is headed that way what do we do sit here and wait until this crisis engulfs us to the point where everything is lost that is the real danger to this country not a fnreign invasion we inside the united states face this danger so all this does is say look fellows just bring that jam from up on that top shelf where only the h l bunker hunts and all those guys are able to get it and bring it down here where the common folk can reach it they will know what to do that is all so we allocate a national credit allocation of 6 billion to be apportioned over a period of 3 years through the trust fund it is going to be a trust fund and it cannot be used for any other purpose eligible will be those families whose median income does not exceed 115 percent of the median average in that area and who have not bcen homeowners in the immediate past 3 years we are targeting these brandnew wouldbe homeowners who could own their own homes if given a little help we cap interest rates at 6 percent and that is the nub of the matter the s ls in the state of texas are dead even the stronger ones are losing money they may not be bankrupt but nobody can stay in business if they keep losing money and we have had a record number of bank closings already since january 1 everybody might think that this is a texas phenomenon let me assure my colleagues that this is a national problem all throughoul the nation these institutions are in trouble now do we want to sit here and say at no time will i allow the taxpayers money to be used as a rescue that is not the issue the issue is are we going to sit here and wait until the insurance fund is bankrupt and we cannot pay the insirance on the covered and insured depositors or account holders we will be yelling to ball them out but by then we are in crisis and we would not be thinking right let us do this now and we will save the s ls this mechanism that i would use here will actually administer it and this new wouldbe home buyer will go to an s l that will have and will be enabled to keep a home mortgage portfolio as they were intended to be functioning when they were founded so all i am sayng is nothing i am not doing anything radical i am just bringing good oldfash oned oldtime religion which worked back into the system by just bringing it back and giving the people that priceless allocation of credit resources for one of the musts in human existence which is shelter everywhere throughout the globe n human existence a person has got to have three basic things and shelter is one of them i firmly believe and so do the colleagues that have signed on with me these are all responsible hardworking very knowledgeable members of the subcommittee on housing and banking the mechanism is to affirm our faith in those institutions that worked until they strayed from the basics s ls were founded specifically by the congress because a framework is needed of financial institutional reference to create the credit so that one can have a homebuilder build at an affordable cost that he can sell at an affordable rate and stabilize that mortgage by making it a 30year stretchout with a fixed stable rate of interest as i have said since the day i came to the congress and that was 27 years ago when nobody gave a hoot or a gehinny because who would think that it was legal to charge over 10percent interest in fact today most everyone i talk to in and out of congress knows that there are laws protecting against usury let me say there arent and i pointed that out when i got here the first month i got here i came from texas where the texas state senate had just defeated an attempt to get the small borrower in the clutches of the loan shark and i saw those tracks coming up here to the nations capital but i never dreamed that beast would take over and it has there are no protections and there have not been any since 1865 when abraham lincoln had just been killed and the congress passed the national currency act which set up the first framework roughly of the national banking system and abolished the usury law and nothing this is why a person cannot get 10 percent not 11 percent not 15 percent but 21 percent prime interest rates in 1980 and 1981 no nation as i have said ad nauseum hera in the history of known mankinds activity can endure with extortionist rates of interest otherwise known as usury no civilization the history of interest rates parallels the rise and the fall of vast empires this is why we are floundering and we are addressing it here by capping it and saying no more than 6 percent for 30 years and we will have the real resources of this nation we have the secondary mortgage institutions we will bring them into the trust fnma well what are these institutions they have the best of two worlds they are supposed to be semiprivate or quasiprivate but my gosh my colleagues ought to see the salaries the officers get and they are living off of what well it has to be off of the primary market if we have an uithealthy or a broke primary market how can the secondary market be any good this seems to escape all of our refined economists and financiers and all and what we have had is rampant unrestrained greed because all through mankinds history one of the reasons governments have been founded has been to control that so when we take the top away from the corner we should not be surprised and we should not be wringing our hands and shedding tears and gnashing our teeth what else was to be expected the congress helped with the passage of two fundamental acts in 1980 and 1982 i was against both i was the only one i might say so i do not know the only cedentials i have to show whether i was right or wrong is what is happening now the realities of a broken down savings and loan system a floundering financial institution it would not take much we are now dependent upon forces external to our shores as to what we can do or cannot do or what will happen to us because we have been living off of foreign borrowed money and i am convinced that no matter how magnanimous no matter how generous no banker is in the charity business whether he is dealing with the government or anybody else and concomitant with that has been the unanswered questions that i have been raising since the middle and the lat sixties with the first credit crunch of 1966 in june and that is how come president franklin roosevelt and also in the sequela war known as the korean war president truman to wage war borrowed money as they had to as a matter of fact here in world war ii as i said before on the federal level we were using 46 percent of our total gross national product on the federal level to prosecute and win the war but roosevelt and the administration never had to pay even 2 per cent on an average to service the debt truman neither but now as much as 14 percent on treasury tbills all of this travail that the congress went there on this abomination known as the grammrudmanholllngs to balance the budget in 1991 they said i call it grammbo legislation because it was so violative of the constitution that the supreme court knocked out half of it half of the original grammrudmanhollings as some of us predicted all right the first year that is the year before last on march 15 grammrudmanhollings was supposed to announce a savings that is a reduction of the national debt of 15 billion but what they did not announce is that that same day the interest charges to service that debt rose 30 bhuon oh how are we going to balance the budget if we are cutting this and saving that but we are paying more over here twice as much as was said would be saved anybody can tell you that any grammar school child can tell you that that kind of arithmetic is a declining arithmetic it is not an addition it is a subtraction so who is worried about how the system was changed and in what manner in servicing the debt as i am talking here just this day we will be dishing out way over 500 million on interest by definition interest is the most inflationary economic factor known to man because it is something for nothing this is exactly why ancient civilizations prohibited it by penalty of death as the lord jesus christ was preaching the law of that land was that interest and usury were punishable by death so all through history it has been regulated we talk about the japanese competition yes and what i am doing here is what i told the mortgage bankers 4 years ago i had just met with two members of the japanese diet bril liant fellows who were members of the housing component of the diet and two japanese industrialists in construction they were evaluating the american market and they showed me how they were ready to come in and they could set up a single family dwelling unit at 10 000 finance it at no more than 7 percent and i told the mortgage banker i said youre going to have the same thing happen among you fellows because of your accustomed uncontrolled greed as happened to our automobile manufacturers youre going to be invaded and displaced well up to now that has not happened only because there have been some factors there that have contributed to that not happening but i said you gentleman arent going to tell me that we in america dont have the wit and the will to do the same thing and even do it cheaper at 6 percent its just a fact that youre all on a big joyride even more so now within several money manias your real estate investment trusts your collateral money manias they were beginning to see at that point some of the insidious effects of the socalled money market uninsured which today is a time bomb ticking when i asked the new chairman of the federal reserve board mr greenspan last autumn in his first appearance before a committee i said sir what do you intend to do with that 221a percent of that financial segment thats insured that grew up in this mutual money market and he said nothing well to me and i ari no expert it seems like that is a time bomb ticking and sooaer or later it is going to have to be addressed now the congress did not do anything when that was developing because it regulated the banks they were under regulation to the extent they could be but these money market funds were sucking out the technical word disintermediating the other financial institutions that is sucking money out from them in order to go to these highyielding mutuals or rather money markets and this is what is happening now in texas the regulator that did not regulate when he should hav is now trying to piece the parts together stitch them together but what are they doing they are a fiction of the imagination they are dead as a door nail but they are offering high yields 9 9 percent naturally when they see fslic deposits or whatever you want to call them are insured up to 100 000 that is a big selling point and the others the regular plotting institutions cannot pay that high yield so they are going to see their funds subtracted and that is what is happening but the institution is as dead as a door nail what is going to happen when the day of reckoning hits and that insurance fund is not there to meet the protection that has been promised by the government that is what i want to know that is when i want to ask my colleagues who tell me today oh no never taxpayers money i want them to tell me in a few months whether they are going to refuse to vote to save those insured funds"], [0.003316223621368408, 0.5033162236213684, 0, "i by not streamlining its operations it would exercise the use of my 1remain would likely fail in the long term even ing minute to inquire of the gentle if it received federal financial assistance in the short term to ignore the obvious need for system reorganization would not only be foolish policy but it would be a breach of trust with our nations taxpayers whose resources are now clearly at risk in a direct partnership with the system i am encouraged that the system has responded positively and constructively to the structure issue since h r 3030 was reported out by the house agriculture committee following several weeks of intensive study and analysis undertaken by the system banks in dialog with local federal land bank associations and production credit associations the farmerelected directors of all the district banks met in sacramento a response to our bill crafted by system leaders in intensive deliberations extending over several days was presented to the farmerelected directors notwithstanding the diversity of opinion within the system on the question of structure the recommendations presented received unanimous approval from all 12 farm credit districts while i cannot embrace all aspects of this proposal i think it will be invaluable to those who must work with this bill through the remainder of the legislative process it is essential that wb maintain a eonstructive dialog with the system throughout this critical period because we share with its leaders a common desire to ensure the future health and viability of this credit delivery service to americas farmers ranchers and cooperatives time will not permit me to review the systems sacramento proposal in detail however i would like to list what i believe are several of its many positive features the proposal recognizes the need for streamlining the system operation through a reduction in the number of system banks and districts within 90 days of enactment the stockholders of the banks for cooperatives would vote on the formation of a national bank for cooperatives the federal land bank iflbi and federal intermediate credit bank ficbj in districts receiving federal financial assistance would be required to merge on an expedited basis stockholders of flbs and ficbs in all other districts would be required to vote on similar bank mergers within 6 months most importantly significant incentives would be put in place to obtain stockholder approval of plans to reduce the number of farm credit districts from 12 to no more than 6 with 18 months association shareholders in those districts where the ficb and flb have merged would be guaranteed the opportunity to vote on the merger of the flbas with the pcas in their district i believe that this reflects the systems commitment to provide efficient one stop lending services to americas farmers the effort to draft a new farm credit title for the combined flb ficb should encourage us to face a number of the significant policy and technical questions posed by such combinations rhis is a far better course than to simply leave these issues for the farm credit administration to resolve while the proposal retains considerable flexibility the overall direction for system restructuring is clear moreover a number of the possible combinations of system entities contemplated by the original system merger proposal presented last may in hearings before my subcommittee have been eliminated i believe that this reflects a recognition on the systems part that we need orderly change and not a hodgepodge of new system entities again i say to my friends in the system who have labored to further develop this proposal we must continue to work together i know your views on the importance of obtaining stockholder approval of mergers and how difficult it must have been to accept any form of mandatory restructuring however we are talking about a massive infusion of federal dollars into the system and with the new secondary market for farm loans a radically new playing field for agricultural lenders as the representatives of the american taxpayers and for the farmers who rely upon the system for credit we in the congress must find a way to justify the expenditures of federal funds to ensure the continued viability of the farm credit system with your continued cooperation i am certain that we will succeed i would like to request that the proposed statutory language and explanation of the systems proposal be included in the record"], [0.0034745335578918457, 0.5034745335578918, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding in the 16 years that i have represented the citizens of our nations capital in the congress without a vote on this floor i dont know when i have wanted more to cast a vote on behalf of my constituents than on this day and on an issue like this where we can right a tragic and historic wrong i cannot vote today because while the citizens who elect me pay more per capita in federal taxes than the residents of 49 of the 50 states my constituents alone among americans still endure the tyranny of taxation without representation i am here to appeal to my friends in this body to vote for me on this bill vote against the lungren amendment vote for the committee bill it brings goose pimples to the skin of many of us who truly love this country to think that on this very day 200 years ago september 17 1787 the founding fathers signed the constitution of the united states and thus launched it on its historic and magnificent journey down the corridors of time i find myself asking the question had i been privileged to be one among them on this day 200 years ago would i too have signed the document i have concluded that i would have voted with the founding fathers its glaring imperfections to the contrary not withstanding yes i know that the constitution they signed extended the right to vote only to those who owned property it denied women the right to vote altogether i know that it declared my forebearers to be only threefifth citizens with no rights that white citizens were bound to respect but i would have voted yes on this day 200 years ago id have voted yes because the constitution they drafted was not a perfect document but a living document it was not a finished document but a document that they could grow as our nation grew it was not a document that embodied justice but a document that gave us room for the continued pursuit of justice through 24 amendments to that constitution we have been wise to right historic wrongs and to extend the blessings of liberty to all within our land we have an opportunity today to right a wrong done our japaneseamerican citizens you will have an opportunity later this fall to right a wrong that we continue to visit upon the citizens of our nations capital it is significant that our committee of the district of columbia is on this historic day filing its report on h r 51 a bill to extend full citizenship rights to district residents through statehood i urge every member to ask him or herself would i have voted with the founding fathers 200 years ago to end the tyranny of taxation without representation for the thirteen colonies if your answer to that question is yes then i hope you will vote no on the lungren amendment yes on the committee bill and yes on the d c statehood bill this fall to end the tyranny of taxation without representation for the citizens of the last colony"]]}
