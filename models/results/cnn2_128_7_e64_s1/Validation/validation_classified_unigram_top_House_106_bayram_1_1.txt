without instructions as is the right of minority members of the house what we have learned after 87 years of the current system is this if we had sat down at the beginning of 1913 and asked ourselves how could we build a tax system that would punish people for earning and working hard a system that would be obstructive of capital formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades the privacy of every single american citizen there are 100 000 people at the irs who know more about us than we are willing to tell our children i want them out of our lives these are not bad people they are people doing the job that this congress by statute has directed them to do but we should not have any agency of government that knows how much money you make or how you spend it that should be none of our business we should not have anybody who can look into your records and know your history the government should not be looking over your shoulder counting every dime you earn unfortunately to the irs we are all presumptive tax criminals required to open up aspects of our livesto auditors at any given moment for all of these reasons we are here today to debate and pass h r 4199 what the legislation before us today does is to sunset the current tax code effective december 31 2004 and require that congress approve a replacement system no later than july 4 2004 to ensure a smooth transition to the new system on the first day of 2005 this legislation also establishes a bipartisan national commission on tax reform and simplification that is required to report to congress on a new fair simpler tax code the overall intention of this bill is to do three things one sunset the current convoluted tax code two create a commission to consider alternative tax systems and three foster a national debate on how to create a fair tax system for working americans this is not a jump over the cliff as some will say there are several proposals before the congress now that have been carefully thought out the gentleman from texas has one that he has written a book about the gentleman from louisiana has one that he has pushed for several years the gentleman from pennsylvania has a very thoughtful proposal and i have one too all of these are ready to be placed in place they are different but every single one is better than the current system my bill h r 2525 that i introduced with my friend the gentleman from minnesota is a comprehensive tax reform bill the national retail sales tax would put in place a transparent form of taxation that will end the confusion forever this bill is known as the fair tax it would repeal the federal income tax the capital gains tax corporate and selfemployment taxes all payroll taxes including social security and medicare taxes all estate and all gift taxes under the fair tax americans will be able to see exactly what they are paying in taxes and the embedded costs of the irs would be gone because the irs would be gone americans would be able to take their entire check home with them and the irs would be shut down unlike the relatively simple tax return that you would get if we move toward a flat tax under our system we would have no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let me simply say that any of these proposals as i said earlier any of these tax reform changes would be better than the current system i welcome the debate that will

similar to the patients bill of rights has been in fact law in texas now for some time and is working very well and that they have had very few lawsuits and as he mentioned and i think it is so important the reason there are so few lawsuits is because basically the patient protections that we are advocating here at the federal level are preventive measures in other words the hmos when they know they have to provide these protections take more precautions do the right thing therefore it is not necessary for them to be sued except in very few cases i think that sort of belies the critics of the patients bill of rights who say it is going to be litigious and there are going to be so many lawsuits and that costs will go up in fact just the opposite has happened in texas but the problem as mycolleague has pointed out we need this at the federal level because of the federal preemption of those people who come under erisa those who through their employer are in selfinsured plans which is millions and millions of americans that come under that federal preemption so they are not allowed to sue their hmo i do not want to stress the suit aspect however because i do not think that is as crucial as the fact that an individual needs an independent ability to appeal a denial of care and that can be done under the patients bill of rights through a very good internal review or internal appeal as well as an external administrative appeal where an individual goes before a board that is not influenced by the hmo and that board can overturn the decision of the hmo to deny care without having to go to court so there are a lot of ways that we achieve accountability in the patients bill of rights without actually having to bring suit and as the texas case points out those situations where suits are brought are very very few indeed now the reason why the gentleman from texas and myself are here today is because earlier today maybe within the last half hour or hour we passed in the house by a considerable margin a motion to instruct the conferees so that we go to conference on the patients bill of rights and we also directed those conferees to stick with the house version of the bill which is really the only true patients bill of rights what the senate passed in my opinion is really sham reform that does not add up to anything in terms of actually dealing with the excesses and the abuses that we have seen so many times with hmos so i wanted to react to some of the comments that were made on the other side of the aisle by the republicans in the leadership who said this motion to instruct was not necessary well let me say this motion to instruct was necessary and the majority of members on both sides of the aisle voted for it because it is necessary and it is necessary because 4 months have passed since this house took up and passed the patients bill of rights a very strong hmo reform bill and yet in those 4 months even though the senate had passed another bill i think last july or so we still have not seen any action to bring the house and the senate together represented by their conferees to try to come up with a bill that both houses can agree on and send to the president so when the republican leadership says give us more time i think one of my colleagues said on the republican side well we will get to this by the end of the month meaning the end of february my reaction is well they have already had 4 months and time is running out there will not be many days left in this congress certainly we are going to be out of here by october if not sooner and if we do not start meeting and having the conferees meet and talk about the differences between these bills and what can be done to achieve a consensus we will never get a good patients bill of rights passed the other thing i would point out is the reason we insisted on sticking with the house version so that the house version should be the one or something close to it should be the one that the conference adopts is simply because there is such a disparity between the house bill which basically is true hmo reform and protects against these abuses as opposed to the senate bill that really does not cover anybody my colleague from texas was pointing to some of these things but i just wanted to point out some of the gross disparities between the two bills the republican senate bill leaves more than 100 million americans uncovered because most substantive protections in the bill apply only to individuals enrolled in private employmentbased selffunded plans now a selffunded plan is one in which the employer pays medical bills directly rather than buying coverage from an hmo or insurance company these are the ones that come under the erisa exemption or the erisa preemption i should say there was a recent study in health affairs that found that only 2 percent of employers offer hmos that would be covered by the standards in the republican senate bill and only 9 percent of employees are in such hmos selffunded coverage is typically offered only by large companies of 161 million privately insured americans only 48 million are enrolled in such plans and of these 48 million only a small number at most 10 percent are in hmos so when i say that the senate republican bill is sham hmo reform i am not just making that up we have data to show that because of the exclusions and because so many insurance plans so many people covered by their insurance would not come under this bill and have the patient protections we are talking about in effect the senate bill is meaningless it does not have any teeth to it at all because it does not even apply to most people with health insurance the list could go on by contrast i should point out of course tle democratic bill would apply to all those plans and i should say it is not even the democratic bill it is the housepassed bill that was a democratic bill that was passed on a bipartisan basis versus a senate bill all we are saying in this motion to instruct is that we must stick with the house version because if we do not we will not have a true patients bill of rights i wanted to givea few other examples and i am not looking to beat a dead horse here but i want to give a few more examples of the contrasts between this republican senate bill and this essentially democratic house bill that we keep insisting on with regard to care for women in the republican senate bill it does not allow designation of obgyn as a primary care physician it does not require a plan to allow direct access to obgyn except for routine care on the other hand the democratic bill the house bill that we insisted on today in the motion to instruct allows patients to designate obgyn as a primary care physician and provides direct access to obgyn for all obgyn services specialty care how many of our constituents have come to us and told us that some of the problems they have had with hmos is they do not have access to the specialty care that they need well in the republican senate bill there is no ability to go outside the hmo network at no extra cost if the hmos network is inadequate with regard to a particular specialist or specialty care basically what the republican senate bill does is to allow hmos to write contracts rendering the patient protections meaningless in other words specialty care is covered under the contract only when authorized by a gatekeeper well what good is that that is the problem that our constituents are complaining about how they cannot go to a specialty doctor unless they get a referral each time and a lot of times the specialty care is not even available within the network this is all meaningless under the republican senate bill the democratic the house passed bill provides the right to specialty care if specialty care is medically indicated and it ensures no extra charge for use of nonnetwork specialists if the hmo has no specialist in network appropriate to treat the condition just a couple of other things probably the most important thing and i know my colleague from texas would agree is not only the ability to go for some kind of external review if someone has been denied care that is not biased against them or ultimately the ability to bring suit but also the whole definition of what is medically necessary in other words the problem that we face with so many of our constituents is that the decision of what kind of care they need the decision of what is medically necessary which is essentially the same thing right now is basically made by the insurance company or the hmo what my constituents say to me is i do not want the decision about what kind of operation i get or how long i stay in the hospital or what kind of equipment i am eligible to use i do not want that to be made by the insurance company i want it to be made by my physician with me because my physician knows what is best for me he is the medical adviser he is the doctor he is the one that knows not the nameless bureaucrat working for the insurance company well under the republican senate bill they allow the hmos to define medically necessary what is medically necessary no matter how narrow or unfair to patients the hmos definition their definition controls in any coverage decision including decisions by an independent thirdparty reviewer so even if someone had the external review or had the right to bring suit what good is it if all the external reviewer is going to go over or what the court looks at is how the hmo defines what is medically necessary that just kills the whole thing that makes the whole hmo reform meaningless if that decision about how to define what is medically necessary is essentially made by the hmo what we say and most importantly in the housepassed bill the one that we have been insisting on today in the motion to instruct is that that definition is made by the physician with the patient and basically is a definition based on what the standard of care is within that specialty group by the diplomates the people that have the diploma in cardiac care or the people that have the expertise in other kinds of specialty care those are the people who should be defining what is medically necessary i could go on and on and we will talk a little more about why this democratic house bill is so much better than the senate bill and why we need to insist on that in the conference but the other thing that i wanted to mention and then i will yield back to my colleague and this came up again during the debate today on the motion to instruct is that what i see happening here on the republican side of the aisle with the republican leadership is that they realize that the patients bill of rights has majority support in this house and i think also in the senate as well and amongst the american people and so they cannot really fight it any more by saying it is a bad bill so what they are now trying to do is to change the subject instead of talking about the patients bill of rights today so many of my colleagues on the republican side of the aisle tried to bring up other issues one of my republican colleagues talked about why we do not deal with the issue of medical mistakes because that has become a major issue now i am not saying it should not be addressed but why are we mucking up the patients bill of rights when we know where we stand and we know we can pass that and send it to the president to sign why would we want to muck that up by dealing with the issue of medical mistakes which will probably take another year or two to get that resolved and we can finally get a consensus on that another republican colleague talked about access for the uninsured and i am totally in favor of more access for the uninsured the president in his state of the union address the other day and my colleague from texas talked about how we have proposals now on the democratic side that would expand health insurance coverage for more children taking the parents of the kids that are part of the kids care initiative address the problems of the near elderly so they can buy into medicare sure all these other access issues for the uninsured need to be resolved but again we do not have a census on that they are now in the formative stage in terms of the debate and where we are going to go they have to have committee hearings they have to be voted on the floor they have to be addressed in both houses and there is no consensus so again why would we want to muck up the issue of the patients bill of rights which has the consensus and can get the votes and can pass and be signed by the president why would we want to throw in all these other things basically it comes back to what the republican leadership was doing all along with the patients bill of rights they tried their darnedest to try to throw all kinds of poison pills into that debate and add all these amendments with the msas the medical savings accounts the health marts and all these other things even the issue of medical malpractice at one point all these things they tried to throw in as poison pills so that we could not get to the heart of the issue where there was a consensus i simply say once again based on that motion to instruct do not fool around any more let us go to conference we know we can deal with these hmo reform issues these patient protections let us deal with them and resolve them in a way that protects the american people and not try all these other gimmicks to try to make it so we never get to what is really important here and what we can pass with that i would yield back to my colleague"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9995259046554565, 0.9995259046554565, 0, "i rise now

narcotics what is interesting again if we look at the history of what took place this administration has blocked consistently any assistance to colombia to eradicate drugs at their source to go after drug traffickers and to stop the production of drugs so what has happened is they are now becoming producers the gentleman from indiana myself the gentleman from illinois the previous chair of this

has happened an incredible amount of heroin is now being produced and it is now flowing from colombia look at this chart into miami some came through puerto rico because the administration cut the

january 17 1893 the government of the kingdom of hawaii was overthrown with the assistance of the united states minister and unitedstates marines one hundred years later a resolution extending an apology on behalf of the united states to native hawaiians for the illegal overthrow of the native hawaiian government and calling for a reconciliation of the relationship between the united states and native hawaiians was enacted to law the apology resolution acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the united states further it acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over the their national lands to the united states either through their government or through a plebiscite or referendum since the loss of their government native hawaiians have sought to maintain political authority within their community in 1978 hawaii citizens of all races recognized the longstanding efforts of the indigenous people to give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance by amending the state constitution to provide for the establishment of a quasisovereign state agency the office of hawaiian affairs the state constitution provides that the office is to be governed by nine native hawaiian trustees who are elected by native hawaiians the office of hawaiian affairs administers programs and services with revenues derived from lands which were ceded back to the state of hawaii upon its admission into the united states the dedication of these revenues reflects the provisions of the 1959 hawaii admissions act which provides that the ceded lands and the revenues derived therefrom should be held by the state of hawaii as a public trust for five purposesone of which is the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians the admissions act also provides that the state would assume a trust responsibility for approximately 203 500 acres of land that had previously been set aside for native hawaiians under a 1921 federal law the hawaiian homes commission act four weeks ago the house resources committee and the senate indian affairs committee held five days of joint hearings in hawaii on h r 4904 and its companion in the senate s 2899 more than 150 people presented oral testimony to the committees and several hundred others presented written testimony the testimony received by the committees was overwhelmingly in support of the bills in addition to witnesses from the native hawaiian community representatives of the departments of justice and interior the president of the national congress of american indians the president of the alaska federation of natives and the president of the central council of tlingit and haida indians presented oral testimony in support of the bills with the passage of h r 4904 the congress will provide a process for the reorganization of a native hawaiian government and the recognition by the united states of that government for purposes of carrying on a governmenttogovernment relationship this bill provides that the indigenous native people of hawaiinative hawaiiansmight have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous native people of the united statesamerican indians and alaska nativesto give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance it is also important to note that the united states congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of native hawaiians these federal laws provide for the provision of health care education job training the preservation of native languages the protection of native american graves and the repatriation of native american human remains thus the reorganization of a native hawaiian govemment would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve native hawaiians nor would the reorganization of a native hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of american indians and alaska natives for the last 90 years native hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations some have asked whether the reorganization of a native hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming the answer to that question is a simple no the indian gaming regulatory act authorizes indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on indian reservations or indian lands held in trust by the united states and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law but there are no indian tribal governments in hawaii nor are there indian reservations or indian lands and the state of hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming in developing and refining this measure we have worked not only with the a community but with representatives of the federal and state governments with leaders of the alaska native and native american communities and with the congressional caucuses the bill that is before the house today has been revised as a fesult of the testimony received at the hearings in hawaii and in washington d c our objectives are simple and straightforward as a matter of

the service of the at united states forces in the far east to the date was july 26 1941 long before ig pearl harbor the filipino soldiers complied without hesitation they he were part of the united states in their hearts and in their minds n the philippines was considered a possession of the united states in fact perhaps they had no choice but to agree to enlist and become a part of the unitedstates forces they had grown up under the unitedstates rule they spoke english they knew a lot about our government and about our democracy and so when they were called upon to defend this freedom for which we fought and died they willingly signed up stood in line and gave of their lives and it seems to me that the promises made to them at the time that they went into service should be honored the fact of the matter is that there is almost a concession that the promises were made why else do we have a rescission which is a cancellation of benefits that were promised we do not have a rescission if there is not an acknowledgment that there were promises made and commitments given to these veterans but anyway in 1946 the congress of the united states passed a rescission bill and took away all possibility that the promises made to the filipino veterans would be honored by the united states government and that is the shameful act that we are seeking at least partially today to correct these veterans are very old they are in their 80s 85 perhaps 90s many of them live in my district i see them every time that there is a veterans holiday or a memorial day or a gathering in the community and i know how deeply they feel about this issue they see the congress dealing with it and yet due to some legislative thing there is a point of order and the matter cannot be brought to a

california indicated that more than 218 members of this house would vote for this measure this is not the full measure that we feel they are entitled to but it is the most urgent piece of this promise and that is the health care that they so desperately need many of these veterans have returned back to the philippines because that is probably the only way that they could be cared for by their families or some friends or perhaps the health system there would permit them to be cared for but for those few thousand veterans that are here in the united states the delay of a day a month a year

that have been held over the years i think it is really unfortunate that so much of this comes from a theoretical discussion which is purported to be a government report called the gao study i think that it is important when we look at these studies to look at the response the department made with respect to each one of the assumptions that were propounded by the gao report the most significant of it is this use of the words world price anyone who has studied this particular issue will know that the world price is nothing more than a dump price there is no such thing as buying sugar at 8 cents or 9 cents a pound it is only where the excesses the surpluses of all of these government programs all over the world have no internal domestic source to sell then they go out to the world market and they dump it it is absolutely unfair to talk about our sugar program and relate it to the world dump price if we are talking about the cost of sugar to an ordinary family in the united states let us look at the chart here let us look and see what the world price is for sugar in the developed countries we see all of these countries here norway belgium denmark austria italy sweden switzerland ireland france all of these other countries and way down at the bottom here the united states retail price at 43 cents at the top here 86 cents that is what we are talking about when we talk about the cranberry production and the cranberry juice that we were supposed to feel sympathetic about in an earlier discussion we are talking about a retail price in the united states which is significantly lower than what the price is in other countries throughout the world 8 cent 9 cent sugar is unreal in terms of our own domestic market what are we talking about we are talking about killing an industry i cannot think of anybody interested in fairness and support of our farmers in support of agriculture wanting to kill a whole industry in order to somehow fall prey to this mythological idea that they could buy 8 cent sugar in the world dump market it is just not happening i think the real way to look at this situation is what is happening to the sugar prices today we who have sugar production in our districts know that the price has catapulted from about half of what they were perhaps 10 or 15 years ago our farmers are struggling they are in despair i have one sugar company on the island of kauai that is about to close if we do not find a resolution to this problem none of the hawaii sugar is in this commodity market i am not here because we are in that market where we are going to benefit 1 penny from any loan we are restricted from that program but i am here talking about sugar as fundamental industry in this country that has a right to exist to be a part of our economy as any other farm product in this the united states why kill off this industry on a myth prices have gone down over the last year to maybe 18 cents for the people who are producing it but what happens to all of the other products that are using sugar the cakes and the cookies and the cokes all the prices have gone up 15 20 percent there is no economist worth his salt or her salt that can argue that the price of sugar being low is a good thing for america because it is going to lower the prices of the commodities it has not li 1515 the prices of all of these commodities have gone up so the argument that the gao makes that the consumers are paying through their nose because sugar is such an expensive item has absolutely no substance in terms of the rationale for their argument if their argument were true then the prices for all of these commodities cakes cookies and whatever would have gone down there is not one item that we can find on the shelf today in the grocery stores where the prices have gone down that uses sugar as a substance for their production so it seems to me that we have to be together in this discussion about agriculture we cannot pick out one particular farmer we do not have any multibillionaire sugar producers in my state they are all small hardworking farmers who are just making a living so let us stand for the agricultural industry in this country and not kill sugar because somebody does not like the law that we passed in 1996 that was designed to benefit all commodities we have heard a lot of misinformation today about the unitedstates sugar program i want to present a few facts during the 1990s wholesale refined sugar prices fell 11 percent during the same period the retail price of refined sugar increased by 1 percent and the prices of manufactured food products with sugar as a major ingredientcandy baked goods cereal and ice creamrose by 23 to 32 percent since the start of the 1996 farm bill wholesale refined sugar prices are down 26 percent but retail sugar prices have not dropped at all and sweetened products prices are up 7 to 9 percent it is clear that it someone is making a killing it is not the sugar farmers american sugar farmers are in crisis in my state of hawaii only three sugar companies are still operating in 1986 13 operating factories were operating and sugar was grown on all of the four major islands today sugar is produced only on the islands of maui and kauaiand the survival of these companies and the fragile rural economies of these islands are severely threatened by historically low prices this year hawaii sugar farmers are receiving the lowest prices in 18 years for their sugar those who would like to kill the unitedstates sugar program cite the socalled world price of sugar of 8c a pound no onenot even countries that use child laborproduces raw sugar for 8o a pound this world price is in fact a dump price for excess sugar that bears no relationship to the actual cost of producing sugar the dump market represents the subsidized surpluses that countries dump on the world market for whatever price that surplus sugar will bring a study by lmc international estimated the weighted world average cost of producing sugar during the 11year period of 1983 84 through 1994 95 to be 18 040 a pound the actual level is almost certainly higher now because of inflation since that time even though unitedstates sugar growers are among the most efficient in the world they cannot survive when they receive prices on the order of 170 to 190 a pound twothirds of the worlds sugar is produced at a higher cost than in the united states even though american producers adhere to the worlds highest govemment standards and costs for labor and environmental protections unitedstates beet sugar producers are the most efficient beet sugar producers in the world and american cane producers rank 28th lowest cost among 62 countriesalmost all of which are developing countries with deplorable labor and environmental practices unitedstates consumers pay 20 percent less for sugar than the average for developed countries our average retail price for a pound of sugar43 is far below the more than 80e paid by consumers in norway japan and finland the average price paid by consumers in the european union is 520 of course unitedstates prices would be even lower if the retailers and manufacturers did not absorb all of the benefit of the lower prices producers have been receiving over the past three years is the price of sugar a problem for the average american family i dont think so sugar is so cheap that you can pick up packages of it in restaurants and no one cares the average american works 2 3 minutes to purchase a pound of sugar are the opponents of the unitedstates sugar program responding to concerns of consumers clearly not they are responding to pressure from big businesses that want to increase their profits further still at the expense of american farmers the dan miller amendments use consumer cost as an issue to mask the primary motive which is allow cheap foreign sugar into the unitedstates market so that the mega foodconglomerates can make more money the unitedstates sugar and corn sweetener producing industry accounts directly and indirectly for an estimated 420 000 american jobs in 42 states an for more than 26 billion per year in economic activity defeat the miller amendments that seek to destroy the unitedstates sugar industry i also wan tot respond specifically to the contention by mr miller that the unitedstates sugar program costs consumers 1 9 billion per year first the deeply flawed study by the gao has been thoroughly discredited by the usda economists at the usda have serious concerns about the gao report which suffers in a numbers of regards relative to both the analytical approach and the resulting conclusions usda concluded gao has not attempted to realistically model the unitedstates sugar industry the validity of the results are therefore suspect and should not be quoted authoritatively as with the 1993 version of this report the gao assumes that food retailers and manufacturers would pass every cent of savings along to consumerswe have convincing evidence that this will not happen mr miller is also very critical of the moves by the usda to remove excess sugar from the domestic market in order to stabilize the price of sugar and thereby avoid very expensive forfeitures several factors account for the excess of sugar on the market good yields due to favorable weather increased imports and schemes that undercut the foundation of the sugar import quota such as importation of stuffed molasses a product with a high sugar content which is made into refined sugar and importation of dumped sugar via mexico under the reduced nafta tariffs the miller amendments to prevent the usda from making purchases to reduce the supply of sugar and to avoid forfeitures will cost the government money purchases cost less per ton and will avoid a much larger volume of forfeited sugar purchases instead of forfeitures for the 132 000 tons the government purchased this year will save taxpayers 6 million in avoided forfeitures sugar farmers like other farmersare suffering prices for most crops are at or near alltime lows the government has stepped in to avert a disaster in rural america by providing over 70 billion in payments to other farmers since 1996but no assistance has been given to sugar farmers moreover sugar farmers have contributed 288 million in marketing assessments to reduce the deficit and prior to the recent sugar purchase the sugar program has operated at no cost to the unitedstates treasury it angers me to hear members talk about the sugar program benefitting only a few wealthy sugar barons i can tell you that the small growers who supplied the now defunct hilo coast processing company were not and are not sugar barons now many are not even farmersthey are unemployed and the thousands of people who work for or whose jobs depend on the remaining sugar companies in hawaii are not rich they work hard at their jobs and have to pay their mortgages and save to send their children to college in hawaii we have over 6 000 jobs dependent on the sugar industry these are good jobs that pay a living wage include health benefits retirement and other benefits unitedstates sugar producers are providing these jobs while complying with unitedstates labor and environmental law unitedstates consumers benefit from the unitedstates sugar program they benefit from the stability it ensures and the access it provides to quality sugar produced by unitedstates companies a strong domestic sugar industry contributes to our economy by producing jobs the demise of the unitedstates sugar industry would mean the loss of these jobs to sugar producers overseas that do not have labor or environmental protections and in documented cases use child labor to produce cheap sugar are we willing to forsake our own sugar producers so that the international food cartels can buy cheap sugar produced by twelve yearolds in brazil or guatemala i hope not in hawaii the decline in sugar prices has been ruinous these prices threaten the survival of our remaining sugar companies and the livelihood of workers in our rural areas sugar production ended on the island of hawaii several years ago nothing has replaced sugar as a viable agricultural crop and the former cane lands remain idle unemployment is high and drug problems have increased as have the social costs of dealing with these issues the islands of maui and kauaiwhere the sugar industry is a major source of employmentwill face the same devastating consequences if we do not give sugar farmers a fair price i urge my colleagues to reject the false consumer cost argument based on the gao report and vote today for a unitedstates sugar industry that will continue to provide jobs here in america defeat the miller amendments"], [0.005375385284423828, 0.49462461471557617, 1, "as i have listened to the words here today i must say that iam more encouraged today than i have been since last

michigan are going to send a letter over to the chairman of the committee and ask that we meet i commend both of them for doing that i was grateful to hear about the discussion that i know has been discussed privately but never i do not believe on the floor before today of how we can close the gun show loophole in a way that works that the gentleman from illinois described and the gentleman from michigan has described i would just like to say that i hope that the very positive language is followed up with very positive action i know that action is hard to do because there are forces in the country that are opposed to taking action and it will take us all working together to make sure that this gets done i agree with the gentleman from illinois that there are many problems that face america the overavailability of guns is one of them but we know that there are people who are emotionally unstable people suffering from untreated mental illness that go on rampages children that have been abused or neglected and who do wrong things all of those problems will continue to exist but if we can reduce the availability of weapons that can hurt so many then we will have achieved something and we will still have the other issues to work on i would just say that i am happy to hear the words i am eager to see the action i am hopeful that the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from illinois can sit down as soon as possible even after the vote on this motion today the letter i think has now been reprinted and will be sent off i am willing to do anything i can to be

colleague from virginia herb bateman who served this body with dignity honor and dedication since his election in 1982 i first met herb bateman in the 1970s when he was a democratic state senator from newport news and i was a young legislative aide in richmond i met him at a meeting where i was on staff and we were revising the juvenile code of virginia i will never forget the first meeting he said i dont know anything about this subject they put me on it everybody else was instant experts in the room at the end of the study herb bateman wrote most of the revisions of the code he was a doer he was a detailed legislator he wanted to understand all the ramifications of what happened many times when we would have tough votes here on the floor and we would go to herb he would talk about how things were being implemented how the bill would affect different people how it would play out how it would work never did i hear him say what are the politics of this this was a man who rose above the politics of the moment this body could use a few more people like him who never engaged in the harsh partisanship that sometimes characterizes this body particularly now that it is so cloely divided herb was a gentleman always a great patriot i will never forget his kind and valuable tutelage when i first came here to the house his leadership on the committee on transportation and infrastructure and of course his leadership on military affairs something many of my colleagues have spoken about here and his undying support for the newport news shipyard where he was just a staunch defender here in the house of representatives and the teamwork with senator warner i think has saved that institution and made it much of what it is today through some very trying times on a political and ideological level there was much to learn from herb his fiscal conservatism his commitment to restraining big government and protecting the taxpayers interests i will never forget one year the national taxpayer groups came out with a rating of what member of congress not just in their votes but in the bills that they cosponsored what was the total cost and herb bateman was the frugalest of all of the members never one for fanfare to put his name on a bill to get him votes here and there he was always conscious this was the peoples money not his own money to spend his record bore that out it did in subtle ways never with a big press release but the groups that came in and examined this could confirm herbs commitment to the taxpayer his unwavering support of a strong military and the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting our nation seemed to be a part of everything he did here he was very concerned about what has happened to our military over the last decade always first and foremost in his mind is what can we do for defense there was his dedication to cleaning up the chesapeake bay his leadership on these issues and so much more i mourn his loss as a friend and colleague but in truth the loss of herb bateman is a loss to the national landscape this body could use more legislators like herb bateman more than just a member of congress he will be remembered as a father a husband a teacher an attorney an air force lieutenant defender of freedom around the world i want to extend my deepest sympathies to his wife laura and their children one of

with the gentleman from michigan the gentleman from louisiana the gentleman from ohio this is an historic day on the floor of the house the legislation will create a legal framework for electronic commerce in the new economy but the new economy must have old values that is the formula that we are constructing here on the floor today it will grow electronic commerce as an increasingly important part of our economy and increasingly it will be important for us to be able to authenticate and to validate electronic transaction this is important for both ends of the transaction for both the buyer and the seller there has to be a way in which there is authentication there has to be a way in which there is validation as we come here today we begin the new era of a digital john hancock which can ensure that an electronic signature is valid and that records are established that guarantee that both ends of the transaction are in fact valid today many secure electronic technologies such as cryptographic digital signatures allow consumers and businesses to send a file across the internet embodying a contract a signed contract that can be authenticated on the other end of the transmission the increased comfort people will have with the technology and their legal rights will serve to enhance electronic commerce and continue to drive electronic growth think of this in 1999 there was 3 4 trillion worth of electronic commerce in the united states 3 4 trillion how much of that was online pick a number in your own minds of the 3 4 trillion 20 billion that is all about 7 10ths of 1 percent as each year goes by there is going to be a dramatic increase in order to make people feel comfortable to move their transactions from the real world to the virtual world we must give them the same kinds of guarantees this legislation strikes the right balance by clarifying that electronic contracts or agreements that are otherwise required to be in writing must accurately reflect the information set forth in the contract after it was first generated and must remain accessible for later reference transmission and printing so this is a great day i think a new era is dawning i want

their homes and burning and bombarding countless villages now we must do everything in our power to put an end to this tragedy to halt the mass killings and hold accountable those responsible for the unspeakable atrocities that serbian forces are committing against the ethic albanians in kosovo first we must aid the refugees in any way that we can we cannot allow refugee camps to turn into death

kosovars unfortunately we did not act soon enough to address the murderous actions by serbia and today thousands of people are dead because of international indifference we ought to create safe havens
