chairman it is true that we did not make this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference report paves the way for dramatic improvement in the

section of this conference report republicans rejected attempts to impose the restrictions of the kyoto global warming regime on americans without senate consideration of the treaty nevertheless the

100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited

"last april shortly after the terrible tragedy that occurred at columbine high school in colorado i spoke with my freshman colleague from the state of washington my colleague from washington is a trained psychologist so i asked him for his thoughts about the columbine tragedy since mr baird is a trained psychologist i was expecting a long academic explanation using lots of psychological terms regular people do not understand instead he had a simple solution an explanation he looked at me and said baron our schools are too big and these kids do not know one another the columbine tragedy and other recent events of violence in our schools have made all of us take a serious look at our children our schools and ourselves these recent tragedies have forced us to think about how we educat6 our children and how we can make our schools safer and better this is a personal issue for me for my wife betty is a middle school teacher and my youngest daughter is in the eighth grade at a public school in my hometown of seymour indiana i do not believe that there is one easy solution to all of the problems our schools and our children face today nor do i believe that we politicians in congress could pass some law that would solve every schools and every childs problem i strongly believe that the people who work with children every day the parents the teachers and local school administrators are in the best position to make decisions about their schools but this week i am introducing a bill that i hope will make some small contribution to addressing a problem that i and other people have been talking about for many years it is a problem that the recent episodes of school violence in colorado and georgia and other places around the country have once again brought to the forefront of our national debate it is the problem that my colleague dr baird was talking about our schools are too big and too impersonal too many of our children wake up every day aifd go to schools that make them feel disconnected and detached from their teachers their parents and their communities the goal of my bill that i am introducing the smaller schools stronger communities act is to make our schools smaller and to help parents teachers and administrators and students strengthen the sense of community that many of our schools today are lacking my strong feelings about this issue come from my own experience growing up in southern indiana when i was growing up in jackson county there were more high schools than there are today in towns like tampico and clear spring and cortland there were high schools that local kids attended and local families supported these communities were proud of their schools their schools brought people together and helped keep their towns strong and vital places to live these schools were the hearts of the communities and when we consolidated when school consolidation forced their high schools to close it tore the heart out of these communities these high schools along with thousands of other smaller schools around america were closed because for many years educators have followed the rule that bigger schools are better for a long time we all assumed that bigger schools were better because they could offer students more courses more extracurricular activities and could save school districts money the statistics on school size show how dramatically this biggerisbetter approach has changed the way we educate our children in 1930 there were 262 000 elementary middle and high schools in america today there are only 88 000 schools in 1930 the average school had 100 students todays average school has 500 students some education experts are now arguing that school consolidation has gone too far more and more educators today believe that our children do better academically and socially in smaller schools that are closer to their homes and their parents than in the big schools with thousands of students because many schools have become too big they sometimes harm the students they are supposed to be helping many students in big schools never develop any meaningful relationships with their teachers and never experienced a sense of belonging in their schools when i start looking at the issue of big schools i was surprised to find that some of the biggest critics of big schools are high school principals the men and women who run our high schools who work with our teenagers every day say that schools are too big and too impersonal in 1966 the national association of secondary school principals released a report criticizing the bigness of todays high schools the principals recommended that the high school of the 21st century be much more student centered and personalized here is what the high school principals said students take more interest in school when they experience a sense of belonging some students cope in large impersonal high schools because they have the advantage of external motivation that allows them to transcend the disadvantage of school size many others however would benefit from a more intimate setting in which their presence could be more readily and repeatedly acknowledged experts have found that achievement levels in smaller schools are higher especially among children from disadvantaged backgrounds who need extra help to succeed a recent study of academic achievement and school size concluded that high schools and smaller schools perform better in course subjects of reading math history and science students in smaller schools also have better attendance records are less likely to get in fights or join gangs a principal of a successful small high school recently wrote that small schools offer what metal detectors and guards cannot the safety and security of being where you are well known by the people who care for you the most the bill that i am introducing the smaller school strong stronger communities act provides grants to school districts that want to develop school size reduction strategy this bill does not introduce a new mandate or try to micromanage local education authority it simply supports education leaders in school districts who decide they want to implement a plan to reduce the size of their school units either through new building space or through schools within schools i hope this bill will encourage local school districts to take a look at this idea and perhaps think about ways they can make their schools smaller and to find ways to help students feel connected again to their schools and their communities and their parents this bill and the academic research i have been discussing here today make a very simple point about our schools our kids and ourselves our lives are better when we feel

majority of the members of the house agree with i believe most of us agree today that there ought to be a background check before somebody can buy a gun at a gun show and most of us agree today that juveniles should not possess assault weapons except in the narrowest of circumstances under direct parental supervision and most of us believe without much convincing that it is a good idea to require gun dealers to give customers who buy a gun a gun safety lock which they can decide whether to use or not in fact this idea is so good that 90 percent of gun dealers already do this without the government telling them to do so and i believe most of us today support the concept of a juvenile brady law in other words a law that will prevent people who commit serious violent acts as juveniles from owning a gun even after they teach the age of 18 and so as written this motion is not objectionable but while i will support the motion i must also say i fear it is so general that some members may get the wrong impression this motion may lead other members to think that these provisions are still in dispute in fact most of us working to achieve a compromise between the two bodies on this issue have already agreed to include these provisions the real problem that remains is that members on the gentlewomans side of the aisle will not seem to accept any language other than that which passed in the other body the provision they insist on the socalled lautenberg provision would do the following it would require anyone visiting a gun show who merely discusses selling a gun to sign a ledger and provide identifying information even if they do not bring a gun to the gun show to sell it would make gun show promoters liable if a person who is not a vendor at the show sells somebody else a gun without first doing a background check it would require persons who merely discuss selling a gun during the gun show but who do not sell the gun for weeks after the show to nevertheless have a background check performed even current law does not require background checks for gun sales by private citizens it would require licensed dealers to perform all of the background checks at the gun show even for purchasers who do not intend to buy a gun from that dealer and it could turn estate sales yard sales even casual gatherings of friends who collect or trade guns into a gun show by definition with all of the regulatory requirements and attendant liability for failing to follow these regulations in short the lautenberg provision goes far beyond simply requiring background checks to be done for the sale of a gun at a gun show and so i say to the gentlewoman if she means what she says in her motion that she wants background checks at gun shows then i am confident we can produce a bill that will pass and do exactly that but if what she means is to insist on the language from the other body then she is seeking to regulate in a manner that goes far beyond what is stated in her motion so i support the motion but i caution members that this issue is not as simple as this motion might make it seem to look on first appearance and i urge the gentlewoman and the members of the other side of the aisle to work with us on a provision that will do what she seeks to instruct today but which does not bring with it all of the other regulatory requirements of the lautenberg

world both domestically and globally and do what the constitution requires us to do and not abrogate our responsibility to the courts and other federal regulators i am most intent on saying that is it a perfect bill no can it be after all these years of negotiation maybe not maybe but on the other hand only not perfect because we cannot get all these industries to agree on every single thing but we

the 1930s glasssteagall did its part in its day but the financial world has changed and we must have a financial system that is able to compete in the modem world our current statutory framework has remained stuck in the 30s because of congresss reluctance to act hampering the ability of our financial institutions to compete in the absence of congressional action federal agencies the courts and the industry have been forced to find loopholes and novel interpretations of the law to allow financial institutions to adapt to an everchanging marketplace unfortunately this has resulted in piecemeal regulatory reform that may not be in the best interest of the unitedstates financial services industry as a whole as elected representatives of congress it is our constitutional duty to make the important policy decisions that determine the structure and legal authority under which our financial institutions will operate for congress to not act today would be a serious abdication of our responsibility throughout this process i have based my support for this bill on some very fundamental principles it must 1 preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system including the federal deposit system and the rest of the federal safety net 2 provide for fair and equal competition and 3 protect consumers and enhance their choices h r 10 maintains these fundamental principles much like the bill we passed last year h r 10 creates a new holding company structure under which entities that are financial in nature can directly affiliate this new holding company will be overseen by the federal reserve board but each affiliate will be regulated by its own functional regulator h r 10 includes important new consumer privacy provisions requiring banking institutions to tell customers their policies for sharing customers financial information with bird parties for marketing purposes it would also makes pretext calling illegal in addition the bill prohibits all insurance companies including companies not affiliated under a financial holding company from disclosing medical information to third partieswithout prior consent in addition to these important privacy provisions my colleagues and i will later be offering an amendment that further enhances privacy protection finally we have included legislation that i introduced which provides important consumer atm disclosures these provisions mandate clear atm fee disclosures and guarantees the consumers rights to opt out of a transaction before a fee is charged this legislation also includes language i proposed to allow new financial holding companies to retain or acquire commercial entities that are complimentary to their current or future financial activities while i do not support full mixing of banking and commerce this amendment accepts the reality that the lines between financial and commerce are blurring at a time when we are allowing various financial to affiliate and create new financial holding companies it is prudent to provide flexibility for companies to engaged in activities which may not meet the definition of financial but are complimentary to the financial activities this provision stipulates that the investment in the complimentary activity must remain small and will be subject to federal reserve review for those of us that serve on the banking committee we are painfully aware of how controversial the issues surrounding the financial services industry can be to say the least various sectors of the financial services industry have had different and often conflicting views on how best to go about modernization but h r 10 includes many compromises between all of the interested parties andit deserves our support did everyone get everything they wanted no they did not in fact i strongly oppose the operating subsidiary provisions included in this bill we must work to improve this regulatory structure in conference in addition while i support the provisions in the bill that would close the unitary thrift loophole i do not support permitting the transferability of unitary thrift holding companies to commercial entities the unitary thrift provisions included in this bill today do not prohibit transfers to commercial entities in short allowing the transferability of unitary thrifts to commercial entities in the same as allowing full banking and commerce i do not support full banking and commerce and believe it could pose serious safety and soundness risks to the deposit insurance fund we respect to the operating subsidiary i am concerned that losses in an operating subsidiary could ultimately affect the parent bank a case in point is the first options continental illinois problems in the late 1980scontinental illinois lost considerable more than its investment in first options while there are firewalls in place that limit the amount of bank investment in times of stress firewalls melt such was the case with first options continental illinois where continental illinois injected millions of dollars to prevent the failure of first options furthermore the likely result of allowing bank operating subsidiaries is that an independent securities industry will become a thing of thepast the advantage that the unitedstates economy has enjoyed is that the credit and capital markets have grown up separately and are strong with each having a great deal of depth not having an independent securities industry will seriously undermine these vitally important markets innovation will be stifled and these markets will become less competitive and importantly it will make it much harder on the unitedstates economy to address economic downturns because the securities system will become directly tie to the health of the banking system any stresses on the banking system will affect all ofthe capital markets i for one do not want to see that result particularly because the simple answer is to allow banks and securities firms to become sister companies through a holding company which means the securities industry will not be tied directly to the banking industry for these reasons i will continue to work to change the operating subsidiary and unitary thrift provisions included in h r 10 as this bill moves through conference however despite the problems i have with these specific provisions i believe that we must act today to pass this landmark legislation there is far too much in this bill that warrants our support we have come too far to turn back now if we fail to act today we will lose the

gun control laws will prevent another occurrence and more importantly whatever gun laws are on the books we need the justice department to prosecute and not just sit there and talk about more gun control so what we need to do is to instruct the justice department today to prosecute the laws that already exist on our books"], [0.009564727544784546, 0.49043527245521545, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me time i rise in support of the delay amendment to limit militarytomilitary contact between members of the united states armed forces and the chinese peoples liberation army the delay amendment would strengthen the limitation already carried in the committee bill that would attempt to better protect our military secrets while not prohibiting vip level exchanges from continuing make no mistake about it there is a need for increased vigilance as the bipartisan cox committee report reminds us the chinese are engaged in a longterm effort to modernize their military and in particular to understand and acquire the power projection capabilities that are the hallmark of our military forces in addition to acquiring united states and western technology to improve their power projection capabilities the chinese are also attempting to understand and even adopt united states military tactics techniques and procedures the essential howto knowledge necessary for effective military operations increasingly the department of defense is being pressured by other elements of our government to work with the chinese military in ways that increase the chances these vital trade secrets might be revealed for example just recently the chinese asked to send a delegation of 20 officers to the united states army training center to be fully integrated into operations there although the chinese were eventually denied full access to the center the army was under pressure from other parts of the administration to give the chinese quoting from an army source a level of involvement that was beyond what we had granted to any other r cantry according to these army documents the army believed the chinese had an ulterior motive for their request the desire to gain insight into advanced army tactics the united states would be foolish to place a higher value on the policy of engagement with china than on protecting the tactics and technologies that are the cornerstone of our national security especially capabilities for power projection that china might well turn on taiwan or our other allies in the asiapacific region i agree with the delay amendment and urge my colleagues to support it"]]}
