jobs in this everevolving economy where more and more of our citizens change their jobs on a regular basis not returning to their old jobs not having the resources to continue insurance on their own you have no choice because you cannot get your family covered it seems to me there are wealthy special interests that want to stop the congress and the american people from addressing the very

that family can have health care we can do that in this congress if the american people will only speak out for all the money and all the special interests on the other side the voice of the american people is stronger they ought not to be confused by people who are more concerned with their own personal profits than with the health of this nation or the health of our children and our families it is easy to stand on this floor and talk about family values but what is stronger in helping a family than helping the family to keep its health care and hold itself together when i was a state representative the first cruel thing i saw as a result of our present health care system was a mother told to go back to welfare because the new job she had finally gotten could not cover her child with a preexisting illness as a member of congress one of the first tragedies we faced was a family that first lost their jobs and then lost their father because of a traumatic brain injury and then lost their home because they had no health care coverage this country can do better we can sit down and be rolled by the people with money by those who want to profit off of the present system or we can join together as a country and make sure that we cover all of our families and all of our children small business in america for the vast majority provide health care for employees but the competitive edge goes to the one side or the other of them companies that are smaller that often provide no health care coverage end up living in the system by having their employees covered by our premiums we pay higher premiums because of this some millions of people who are presently not covered when they end up in the hospital or getting health care benefits that medium and smallsize company today that provides health care also has another competition that has an advantage the large company with thousands of employees which buys the very same coverage for a lot less money my fellow americans we are at a point in this countrys history where we can take a step forward with a health care plan that will guarantee coverage for every american coverage they cannot lose and coverage that keeps their choice but if we fail to act as a congress and as a country if we let those special interests who think profit is more important than the economic health and the physical health of

stateand you probably are that does not have 85 percent truth in sentencing you get no prison money none not one penny you can have an 85 2percent truth in sentencing in practice and in procedure in your state and you get zilch nothing the gentlemans own state of florida under the amendment he has offered would get nothing they have about a 75percent rate many states throughout this country have indeterminate sentences idaho is a good example in idaho state senator darrington who is chairman of the criminal justice committee in idaho testified the state of idaho would have to change 40 of its

rule today i believe there are not so if we believe that we need to build more prisons around this country to house violent offenders we need to reject mccollum besides mccollum has another series flaw and that is that 85 percent of an inadequate sentence is very inadequate so it is not truth in sentencing that is one of our biggest problems one of the biggest problems around this country is that we are not imposing sufficient sentences on violent offenders and what we are saying is that basically that does not matter in mccollum that is why ih the committee bill which is the product of numerous hearings held in a bipartisan fashion we reviewed testimony and fashioned a bill that moves us in the direction where we do have truth in sentencing and provisions in the bill that require truth in sentencing it requires= any state to submit to the attorney general a comprehensive plan that deals not just with truth in sentencing but with the appropriate sentence for violent offenders it also has provisions in the bill that require a better classification of violent offenders to track them when they are in the system that is why the committee bill which was the result of a lot of thought a lot of testimony is a far better approach and it will build more prisons for violent offenders finally the reason the governors around this country are so vehemently opposed to mccollum and

their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period middleclass families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middleclass families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directiy to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business in el paso alone

agreement and in support of h r 5110 the implementing legislation to accompany it i have been following the development and evolution of this legislation very carefully because from the beginning i have had some very serious concerns on two countssovereignty and financing i have made it clear all along that i would not and could not support the agreement or the legislation if it jeopardized or compromised our nations sovereignty in any way and i have made it clear from the beginning that i would not and could not support it if it were not paid for openly and honestly so that it did not add to the federal deficit this implementing legislation has satisfied me on both counts in late september in the ways and means committee the final version of the implementing legislation was dropped in our laps all 651 pages of itand we were asked to vote it out of committee an hour later i cannot read that fast since 1 promised not to vote for gatt until i have read the legislation i felt compelled to vote no in committee last minute changes had been made in the financing section of the bill and in the dispute settlement language and i was not about to vote for it until i had a chance to carefully review those changes since then we have had plenty of time to study it i have gone aver the implementing legislation with a fine toothed comb and i have determined to my satisfaction that the implementing legislation does provide adequate financing to offset the lost revenues from tariff reductions it will not add to the deficit the bill provides for savings of nearly 12 billion in accounting changes outlay reductions and user fees a sufficient amount to offset lost tariff revenues over the first 5 years of the agreement therefore the agreement will not add to the deficit and does not require a budget waiver despite the fact that the tariff reductions under the agreement provide the american consumer the equivalent of a 12 billion tax cut i do wish the financing provisions were a little heavier on spending cuts and relied less on accounting changes however i also believe that if dynamic modeling were used to predict the impact of tariff reductions on our federal budget the increased trade encouraged by gatt would more than offset tariff reductions anyway from a federal budget and tax perspective this gatt agreement is a witnwin situation it is a tax cut for consumers and it will not increase the deficit after thoroughly studying the bill i have also determined to my satisfaction that the implementing legislation does sufficiently clarify the terms of the dispute resolution mechanisms in the agreement and does provide adequate protection and congressional oversight of the trade dispute resolution procedures under the world trade organization i am convinced that this agreement does not in any way jeopardize or compromise our national sovereignty unlike naftawhich i did opposegatt is not something new we have been living under gatt for 47 years it has a longstanding tradition of solving trade disputes through consensus the establishment of a new world trade organization does not change that in fact the agreement and the implementing legislation strengthen that foundation of reliance on consensus like the gatt the world trade organization cannot impose new rules on us without our consent the new wto voting proceduresif they are ever invokedfully protect our interests no vote can force us to accept any amendment that alters our rights or obligations article 10 of the wto agreement states explicitly that any amendment of any kind is not binding on us unless we agree to it the world trade organization cannot override or change unitedstates law seation 102 a of the implementing legislation provides that if there is a conflict between any of our laws and the uruguay round agreements united states law will prevail the world trade organization is not a court it cannot strike down unitedstates a 11447 law it cannot order us to change our laws and it cannot impose upon us any remedies or penalties without our consent if in response to a complaint a wto panel finds that we are violating our obligations under gatt we can choose to offer trade compensation such as lower tariffs in another sectororwe could negotiate another solution with the complaining countryorwe could simply ignore that ruling and take no action at all and allow the aggrieved country to withdraw concessions equivalent to those we withdrew by violating the agreement thats the worst any one could do to us this system is not only fair it

committee on the budget last year they acquitted themselves in fine fashion coming up with facts and figures and a very credible budget the same applies for their work product this year that is why i rise in strong support of the budget offered by the gentleman from ohio which we in the republican leadership adopted as our official position once again they provided us with a credible and complete budget proposal let megive the members the three major reasons why i support this budget first it is a complete one the democratic leadership budget makes some adjustments to the discretionary portion of the budget but that is only onethird of the budget controlled by the appropriation process what about health care reform and welfare reform the democratic leadership tells us we will be dealing with them this year sometime how come they are not in the budget not even sherlock holmes lieutenant colombo or the entire cast of l a law could find a single clue in the democratic leadership budget as to how these initiatives will be financed the kasich budget on the other hand reflects the priorities and initiatives that we republicans seek to further this year and details exactly how those initiatives would be financed are the members looking for specific health care welfare reform and crime control proposals they will find them in the kasich budget what about reforming foreign aid or a family tax credit they will find them in the kasich budget do they seek specific information on which lower priority programs must be reduced they will find it in the kasich budget the second major reason for supporting the kasich budget is this it is the only budget alternative that contains a more realistic level of defense funding the democratic defense figures arenot sufficient to fund even their own defense program as determined by their own defense departments recent bottomup review if they will not take their own program seriously enough to fund it then what are the rest of us supposed to be thinking furthermore the democratic budge~t figures do not support a full military pay raise as we do finally the kasich budget provides approximately 150 billion more in deficit reduction over the next 5 years when the kasich budget is adopted and implemented a real budget with real savings is that not a refreshing idea compare it with a democratic leadership budget that has as many holes in it as the new york mets infield the kasich budget is a reality the democratic budget is only virtual reality i would urge my colleagues to vote for the only real budget in town as

more than once is not financially fit to acquire yet another carrier and cannot be certified to do so by the department financial fitness today is determined on the basis of case history rather than statutory instruction case history of course can be fluid but it is the case history of eastern and continental airlines that is the underlying motivation of this legislation there are many former eastern airline employees in the third congressional district of georgia who are still suffering from the financial antics of the management of not only eastern airlines but continental airlines as well these airlines their customers and hard working employees were victimized by inept management they were systematically stripped of their assets millions of dollars were lost by investors and thousands upon thousands of hardworking employees were left without jobs one such family i recently spoke with is typical of those impacted by the demise of eastern they told me that even though eastern went out of business years ago they still drove their same old car still wore their same old clothes and had virtually nothing but the barest necessities this hardworking employee who had once believed in and worked with pride for the company had to resort to bankruptcy in order to hold the family together the plight of families such as this is of great concern to me because there are hundreds and hundreds of families that feel the same effect of mismanagement on this scale families that are torn apart by the bitterness and greed of a very few these families do not want government handouts they want to work but for many there is still no work in the case of texas air corp the management headed by frank lorenzo is responsible for these abhorrent acts he broke the backs of eastern and continental and then sold off pieces to the highest bidder he called upon the employees to believe in him and trust his ability to help the ailing carriers and then callously turned his back on them to make a huge fortune at the employees expense the damage to these people has been done but it is our responsibility not to let this happen again that is the purpose of this legislation
