crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable francis j meehan ambassador to poland the honorable william wilson the presidents personal envoy to the holy see and peter s bridges director eastern

of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.00428241491317749, 0.9957175850868225, 1,

sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city

governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.028044188395142555, 0.028044188395142555, 0,

risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his

coastal and marine resource programs that serve both national and state interests as the need for management of our coastal and ocean resources increase it is essential that we give the relevant agencies adequate financial support so that the goals of the coastal management laws enacted by congress can be carried out this proposed legislation gives the states and federal government the opportunity to continue the essential partnership which was established in the coastal zone management act of 1972 and which congress has since recognized as an internal part of ocean resource management the partnership initiated in those laws has led to a balanced and coordinated decisionmaking process that sets up guidelines for a variety of activities occurring in the coastal zone the fisheries conservation zone and on the outer continental shelf h r 5543 includes provisions that insure the continued funding of the coastal zone management act and the national sea grant college program which are the cornerstone of national oceanrelated planning and research activities these laws were enacted in response to rapidly increasing pressures on this nations coastal resources which have not diminished in any way since then in fact in view of the recently approved outer continental shelf accelerated 5year leasing plan i would submit that the pressures on our marine resources are greater than ever as multiple and competing uses take place in areas of national concern or under federal jurisdiction states coastal and marine resource management agencies inevitably become deeply involved in addressing national concerns maintaining federal support of programs such as coastal zone management and sea grant as proposed in h r 5543 is an entirely appropriate role for the federal government to play the money allocated through the ocean and coastal resources management and development fund will be transferred to the states through an already wellestablished program that was set up to help the coastal states handle the pressures of a federal activity offshore drilling that federal activity now seems to be a top federal priority and we cannot ignore the impact this has on coastal communities the czm program is a very diverse one and each federally approved state program is designed to meet the needs of that particular state to obtain federal approval the state plan must take into account the national interest and also coordinate activities with local governments and the public this program therefore represents the necessary and important balance among federal state and local concerns and presents the rare opportunity for communication so that as many of those interests as possible can be recognized the resulting programs now acquired by 27 states and territories focus on the review and analysis of ocs exploration and development plans assessment and analysis of the impacts of proposed uses of marine and coastal zone resources expanded enforcement responsibility in all areas of environmental concern and resource management in the coastal zone and expanded biological research activities again i do not think it is appropriate for the federal government to turn its back on these projects especially at a time when accelerated offshore leasing is certain to generate additional state concerns we cannot simply say that we are no longer concerned with offshore fisheries problems or the impact of energy development on the coastal zone because in doing so we will damage the partnership we have so carefully crafted h r 5543 establishes a fair and equitable method of providing a continuing federal role in that partnership it must be recognized that our marine and coastal resources need to be conserved and managed and that this must be considered as a policy of importance the enactment of the 200mile limit law in 1976 represents the unitedstates claim to jurisdiction over the resources out to 200 miles and the appropriate

committee on printing whose decision on this matter is final both parties having failed to reach any agreement appealed their cases to the joint committee on printing to assist the committee in discharging its responsibilities under the kiess act the joint committee on printing appointed an independent fact finder acceptable to both management and labor at gpo the independent fact finder mr frederick u reel an expert in collective bargaining matters whose name was provided by the federal mediation and conciliation service conducted extensive hearings and accepted briefs from both parties for example in his preliminary statement the fact finder states the ensuing hearings consumed seven days including three night sessions yielding a transcript of 2 140 pages and over 150 exhibits many of them consisting of multipages of charts and financial data largely relating to wage rates costofliving increases and job descriptions opening briefs exclusive of voluminous appendices totaled 173 pages and reply memoranda filed by each party exceeded 40 pages exclusive of further extensive appendices all parties were represented by counsel of long experience and unusual ability in labor relations matters they were able to agree on one point that the instant proceeding was in their experience uniquely complex on september 9 the fact finder forwarded his written findings of fact and nonbinding recommendations to the joint committee on september 23 the joint committee will meet to make its final decision at this time i am submitting the fact finders opinion and recommendations into the record in order to make it available for all my colleagues to closely examine as a member of the joint committee on printing i have not made my final decision on the matter however i strongly urge my colleagues to study the opinion of a seasoned professional with lengthy experience in labormanagement relations who conducted arbitrationstyle proceedings which were fair to all parties it was only in this forum and through this process that mr sawyers position on gpo craft wages has been subjected to challenge and critical analysis accordinglly this document is submitted for the record as

just prior to the nazi invasion of june 22 1941 the baltic countries had the great misfortune to be invaded three times during world war ii twice by the red army and once by the german army deportations and executions of these baltic citizens continued right up until the wermacht tanks rolled into the baltic nations later in the month when the baltic nations were reoccupied the brave seople of those nations resisted heroically from roughly 1944 to 1947 they fought pitched battles with regular red army troops but mainly with mvd formations all during this period the forced deportations continued and there are photographs available of some of these infamous happenings to prove what took place an inordinate number of balts came to populate the forced labor camps those who lived to be released from the camps were never permitted to return to their native lands but were forced to live in central asia and other areas foreign to them by the end of 1949 a grand total of 850 000 people have been removed from their native landsor roughly 10 percent of the population of the countries involved from the soviet point of view this was a logical move they exterminated or removed most of the opposition to their rule or so they thought the clergy military officers and intellectuals however the resistance continues to this day and there are even forced labor camps on baltic soil today as part of their overall plan the soviets moved great russians and reliable communists steadily into the baltic nations to act as a check on local nationalistic tendencies but they have always remained outsiders we who live in freedom can only wish lithuania latvia and estonia well in their struggle against soviet oppression and try to nourish the hope that they may someday again be free

listening to testimony on for years i do not believe anybody here that is in this congress has heard more testimony other than my good friend the dean of the house the gentleman from mississippi m we have had 2 000 people before our committee but i hear more things when this bill comes up on the floor that i never heard before we have over 200 projects in this appropriation bill and every single one of them probably has some opposition when this project is finished and you are going to finisif it you are not going to stop a project this practically finished i will guarantee that you are going to see the same type of opposition on other brojects they will target another project for deletion last year i pointed out that by accident i got hold of this publication i am holding up it tells me what is going to happen before it happens before i come to the floor i know what is going to happen its says here strategy how to kill the tenmtom i tried last year to find out who publishes this document there is no signature but i will tell you there is some very sophisticated material in this publication it tells you about a visit it is probably worth a hundred letters you got to your congressman and let him know that you are against the tenntom this first time in all these years i ever heard the cost of this project somebody said 3 billion i nearly fainted it never has been over 1 78 bilion that is just all there is to it you cannot make anything else of it but in here they say it is going to cost 3 billion three billion dollars that is a big difference but that is the only place i ever hear it we never hear it before the committee and i never heard it anywhere except in here when this bill comes up but i want you to listen now you listen a minute and see if this rings a bell with you it says here the most effective way to get in touch with your congressman dont go to washington because then you would be lobbying he would look at you you know and he would know you done bought a ticket to come up here and he would think you are lobbying somebody you get an appoint moent with him in his office back in his district and you go in there and you look at the congressional almanac before you go and pick out some votes that you like so you can brag on him you go in there and make him feel good you brag on him and tell him how much you appreciate that vote the way he voted on such and such a bill and then you pop it to him you say now listen i am against the tombigbee now this is not up here in your section of the country all you have got to do is just be for it i want your commitment you know that is way down there that is a boondoggle they have never seen it of course they do not know anything about it but they call it a boondoggle now this has been going on starting last year and this is the second year of it the same old thing these people that are opposing this project not one of them not one of them have come before our committee to give us the benefit of their knowledge they have not told us anything i invited my good friends congressman pritchard and congressman edgar to go down and see this project we have nothing to hide about this project i invited them to go down and i appreciated them going down and seeing it they looked at it and they were briefed by the corps of engineers the people who are building this project the corps are profespional engineers and they would be working somewhere else if they were not here working on the tennesseetombigbee they are professional engineers and we rely on them for technical information i am glad we do not rely on what we hear on this floor become we would be in trouble it would be a terrible water project when we got through with it if we relied on what we hear here the corps said the total cost of the projectis 1 78 billion no one raised a question about it nobody questioned that figure the gao in its recent study discussed coal shipments my good friend from washington congressman pritchard has been told that they cannot use this highsulfur coal from that area down there in foreign countries i will tell my colleagues right now if they will go down there they will see barges of coal six barges together south of demopolis just where they have been for the past 65 years traveling that part of the river and they say it is not navigable and they cannot turn the curves it is a crooked river but it is not so crooked that six barges cannot go down it and have been going down it tied togethereight could but they use six and it has been that way for 65 years there is no authorization and no one is even thinking of building a project south of demopolis let me finish by saying that from my home county coal is going down the tombigbee down the warrior river to demopolis and on down to mobile and being hauled from there into seagoing vessels to japan and all over the world so if the gentleman will he needs to tell the people in japan that have been using that coal for 10 years and they are buying millions of tons what does the gao say about the coal the gao in its recent study was asked and i picked this up because my colleagues have been quoting and finding things in here and they indicate that it says to stop the project there is not anybody that knows anything about that project that ever said to stop it nobody would recommend that the court would not recommend it the court specifically said it would be a mistake to stop the whole project the gao in its recent study was asked to determine whether the coal reserves were available to meet projected shipments over the 50year life of the tenntorn the gao finding and here i am quoting them found an estimated 58 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves are located in those states adjacent to the inland waterway systems with a potential for movement on the tenntom this amount is 48 times the coal estimated to move on tenstom during its 50year economic life the corps of engineers has consistently for 200 years been conservative in their estimates we have checked them out and the benefits have always been more than the corps has estimated someone mentioned that a million dollars is going for a study down south of demopolis of course this is in the report and all they have to do is look and see what is in here do not make it sound like we are trying to start another project we are not there are some locks down there they have been there for 65 years the oliver lock is going to have to be replaced one day this money is to study these old locks one of these days they are going to have to have 0 some repairs on them and some work done on them there is no new project that we are talking about south of demopolis we have all of these smoke screens and i cannot answer all of them i do not have that much time j3ut my colleagues have heard what mr brock said about the coal that we need to be moving on the tenntom we need to ship that coal overseas and more is going to be going overseas the corps said 70 percent of the freight on the tenntom will be coal my colleagues know the important role that coal is playing now some members have said that members of the cabinet are against the tenntom my colleagues heard what mr brock has said he is very much in favor of it the president is for it and the last six presidents were for it there are other projects in there that cost just as much as the tenntom there is not a state in this nation that does not receive money through the projects funded in this appropriation bill every one of the 50 states is receiving money so let us not throw up all of these smoke screens i have never seen such a phony attack as is made on this tennesseetombigbee project this project has been studied more than any project not just any project in the united states but any project in the world it has met every test the l n railroad started this opposition with 15 000 this is where the ball started rolling they do not have their name on this but they put 15 000 into it to start this opposition when the project started they have been to the unitedstates supreme court twice and the supreme court of the united states says you have not got a case they have been in the federal court this is the sixth decision last week which really affirms the strength of this project there actually have been six federal court decisions and twice the unitedstates supreme court said no said the lower courts have handled it right this was on the environmental question on economic feasibility on every kind of question that could be raised and they have raised it so i urge my colleague to vote against this pritchard amendment if my colleagues approve this pritchard amendment they are going to have an area out there that looks like the worst tornado that ever hit any part of the united states i asked one of the engineers yesterday what would happen if we did not get the funding for the project and just stopped it like one or two are advocating here he said well the first thing is that you would have to have people out there to pump the water to dewater the locks and dams there are still six locks and dams in different stages of completion he said if we did not they would just push them up out of the ground talk about a disaster area let me just urge my colleagues vote no on the pritchard amendment"], [0.0021097660064697266, 0.4978902339935303, 1, "2 weeks ago during our initial consideration of the first budget resolution the house spoke very clearly in adopting the oakar amendment to that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee on taxation we have a very simple choice we can continue to waste over 32 billion over the next 3 years on tax breaks for the oil industry provisions which do little to stimulate oil production or energy independence or we can take that sum of money and invest it in our nations elderly and disabled helping them to live a more healthy life the house has spoken once already in adopting the oakar amendment declaring that the health care needs of our older citizens are important than reconstructing brokendown obsolete battleships i ask my colleagues to speak once again and pass this legislation demonstrating that our commitment to the elderly and disabled takes a priority than giveways to the

thought that i was listening to an argument in favor of this bill when he indicated his reasons for being against it then the gentleman from massachusetts said that if a merchant allows his product to be sold at less than the tagged price for cash that that is somehow subsidizing credit card purchasers i have not heard any such illogical conclusion on this bill since i have been in the house i have been listening to debate on this provision now for about 7 years and i argued back 7 years ago that a cash discount was not a finance discharge so that it had to be reported under the truth in lending law that was the whole argument at that time so we said that if a merchant offers up to 5 percent in discount for a cash purchase that would not be regarded as a finance charge i said why do we not take off the ceiling why should there be a ceiling why do we not deregulate the price that is what this is all about if a merchant wants to sell his product below the tag price if a person pays cash for it that is what this is all about that amounts to deregulation of the price of the product also the merchant does not have to go through all the paperwork which is involved in a credit card purchase if the person pays cash i had supposed that there was not going to be any argument or dispute on the first part of this bill on the cash discount provision because it seemed so obvious to me that a merchant ought to be able to offer his product for any price if it is purchased by cash he ought to be able to give it away if he wants to j1 would think that the arguments against this bill as far as the cash discount provision are not well taken the surcharge provision i thought might be misunderstood hi 1732 the surcharge provision is a small businessmans provision many small businesses now use credit cards and it would be unfortunate if a large credit card company which issues the credit card wquld add a surcharge to that small businessman costs after the fact this provision merely says that a surcharge cannot be added on top of a finance charge where a credit card is used for a purchase i just think this should not be allowed"], [0.0021536052227020264, 0.497846394777298, 0, "first i must compliment and applaud the chairman of the committee on public works and transportation for offering his amendment to help resolve the donordonee problem a problem that texas has historically experienced the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas and myself however attempts to correct one of the historic inequities of the federalaid highway program namely the situation which exists for the socalled donordonee states but we do so in a different manner than the chairman over the life of the federalaid highway program and the highway trust fund each state has contributed its share of gasoline tax and excise tax money to the highway trust fund this money is then apportioned among the various 50 states for programs under the federalaid highway system the distribution formulas of these revenues originally devised over 20 years ago are based on a number of factors including total lane miles and total vehicle miles traveled in a state unfortunately because of the failure of these distribution formulas to reflect other statistics many states are not receiving an adequate share of the revenue which they contribute for example my own state of texas will contribute an estimated 783 million in fiscal year 1983 but will only receive back 627 million according to this legislation this represents a return of approximately 968 for every dollar which texas contributes to the trust fund hardly an equitable return on this money our amendment would correct this situation in a way which would not take money away from any other states but would guarantee that each state receive at least 90 percent of its contributed revenues in this way states such as texas will be guaranteed an apportioned share of federalaid highway money which is directly proportional to its contribution level in keeping with this administrations and previous administrations philosophy and the priority of the public works and transportation committees priority of completing the interstate system by 1991 our amendment would exclude the interstate construction program and the interstate transfer program we feel strongly that the interstate is indeed a program of national scope and its completion should not be delayed or deterred in any way the 42 opmile interstate system which is now 95 percent complete provides vital transport and mobility for all of our nations citizens in addition to being one of the essential links to interstate commerce in our country in this regard we recognize and accept that some states will until completion of this system bear a disproportionate share of the cost however the apportionment inequity which now exists for the other federal aid highway programs such as the interstate 4r the urban secondary and primary categories cannot be justified as an overriding national priority rather because these moneys are spent on construction of roads and highways which directly serve the transportation needs of each state their distribution should reflect the diversity of these needs our amendment would correct the donordonee problem by guaranteeing qualifying donor states a minimum of 90 percent of their contributed revenues according to the federal highway administration the revenue needed to fund this guarantee for fiscal year 1984 would totad 225 million with subsequent fiscal years averaging approximately the sume amount this 225 million would be generated from two sources 125 million would come from the interstate transfer authorization and 100 million would come from the interstate discretionary authorization this money would then be spent by the secretary to supplement the trust fund shares of those donor states which do not receive at least 90 percent of their contributed revenues the recipient states would then be free to spend this additional money in whatever highway category they deem necessary an additional feature of this amendment is that it does not increase the authorization levels of this legislation i do not feel that with the deficit for fiscal year 1984 approaching 180 billion we can stand here and arbitrarily increase the spending levels of this legislation i find it unconscionable that with a 1983 authorization level of 12 1 billion we can even consider increasing the authorization levels any further it is because of this terrible deficit problem that our amendment would shift existing authorizations within this legislation to solve the donordonee problem and not increase the overall authorization levels it is only fitting and equitable that states should be receiving a proportionate and fair share of their contribution to the highway trust fund especially since the revenues collected for the trust fund reflect the level of use and road service within each state this amendment would achieve that equity and balance while not penalizing other states in the spirit of fairness and equity i welcome the support of my colleagues and urge the adoption of this amendment"]]}
