that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed and distressed areas

police the congressional budget office the architect of the capitol the capitol visitor center the library of congress the government printing office and the government accountability office as one wise member of our body said the 3 million provided in this bill to operate the legislative branch agencies under the jurisdiction of the house seem straightforward and fiscally responsible i think if we overlooked this appropriations bill which was passed in a bipartisan way the two words you would say are an increase close to the costofliving adjustment and always less than what was requested we requested a fiscally responsible bill for example the overall budget is 230 million less than the presidents budget the house of representatives is funded at 19 million less than the budget request the capitol police gets 12 million more than last year but 36 million below the request the cbo is 1 million more than last year but 1 million less than the request the architects office is 5 million more but 114 million below the request the library of congress is 15 million more than last year but 18 million below the request the gpo is 9 million more but 21 million below the request the government accountability office is 10 million more than last year but 14 million below the request there are a number of other changes made within the bill that i think are also positive one of the changes will be for the members allowances if they are unspent they will be used to reduce the budget deficit for someone who has regularly returned back at least 10 to 20 percent of my budget allocation it is nice to know that it is also going to a worthy cause in addition this bill provides provisions for increased congressional oversight and accountability on the completion of the muchanticipated capitol visitor center as well as some very specific report language and an amendment that dealt also with the architects office and the government accountability office until the new architect is provided the underlying bill provides for full funding of staff colas and transit benefits it bans smoking in the rayburn cafeteria and i understand on page 35 it says that the gentleman from massachusetts will voluntarily give me his salary for the next year or until my personal debt has been retired whichever comes first which will be the year it also provides for 50 new

recognition to express my support for the house amendment to s 3421 the veterans benefits health care and information technology act of 2006 this bill contains more than 60 provisions that will improve the lives and wellbeing of servicemembers veterans and other department of veterans affairs va beneficiaries i would like to address a few of the provisions contained in the compromise agreement section 101 of the house amendment would permit veterans and other claimants seeking benefits from va to have the choice of hiring and paying an attorney to represent them before the agency once a notice of disagreement has been filed current law prohibits an attorney from receiving a fee for representing a claimant until the board of veterans appeals renders its first decision on the claim unfortunately the claims process has become very complex and can be very overwhelming to some claimants this provision would give veterans the option of hiring an attorney earlier in the process if they believe they need assistance with their claim unlike some who have opposed this policy change i believe veterans are competent to make their own decision as to whether they want to hire an attorney to assist them with their claim this section is similar to a bill i introduced earlier this year hr 5549 the veterans choice of representation act of 2006 section 401 of the house amendment would authorize the secretary to furnish a memorial headstone or marker for an eligible dependent child whose remains are unavailable or if feasible add a memorial inscription to an existing headstone or marker provided by va currently va may provide a memorial headstone or marker for a veteran spouse or surviving spouse when remains are unavailable however if a spouse and child die at the same time and in the same manner and their remains are unavailable a veteran cannot receive a memorial headstone honoring the child the provision would correct this inconsistency and is identical to a provision what was passed by the house in july 2006 section 402 of the house amendment would extend until december 31 2007 the secretarys authority to furnish a government marker to those families who request one for the marked grave of aveteran buried at a private cemetery and who died on or after september 11 2001 under current law the secretarys authority expires on december 31 2006 this provision was also passed by the house in july of this year section 403 of the house amendment would authorize the secretary to make grants to tribal organizations to assist them in establishing expanding or improving veterans cemeteries on trust lands under current law tribal organizations are not eligible for state cemetery grants this provision was passed by the house in july 2006 section 404 of the house amendment would direct the secretary of the army to remove the remains of russell wayne wagner from arlington national cemetery and establish procedures that the secretary must follow in carrying out this directive mr wagner was a convicted murderer who died in prison but slipped through a crack in the law and was inurned at arlington national cemetery congress amended the law to tighten eligibility standards earlier this year and this provision would restore the sanctity of arlington by removing his remains from this hallowed ground i support this provision which is similar to section 3 of h r 4352 a bill i introduced in november i would like to mention one final provision that is of interest to me section 823 of the house amendment would require the va in consultation with the secretaries of defense and air force to submit to the committees on veterans affairs and armed services of the senate and house of representatives a report on the options for the construction of a new medical facility in okaloosa county florida the report would be due 180 days after the date of enactment of this bill this report is an important step forward in determining the best way to address the va health care needs of veterans and servicemembers in and around okaloosa county in closing it has been an honor to serve with the dedicated members of the veterans affairs committee and to chair the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs during the 109th congress i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the 110th

independent judiciary because the ninth circuit did not bend to the resolve of congress and because the supreme court skirted the first amendment claims in the newdow i decision members of this house have introduced this resolution in an attempt to strongarm judges and manipulate the supreme court appointment process how sad so i respectfully take issue with this resolution while my reverence for the pledge of allegiance is unending tny patience with this sort of political maneuvering has long run out this resolution is a vehicle simply for a conservative litmus test for new judges particularly supreme court judges as we currently face both a vacancy and a confirmation of a new justice this resolution was introduced the day after newdow ii september 14 it was reported and opponents immediately put it to use in the confirmation process one conservative group used the case as a vehicle to endorse the confirmation of judge john roberts as chief justice and to bash carterappointed district court judge lawrence karlton as a judicialactivist even though he was bound by a prior ruling of the ninth circuit on the merits moreover the gentleman from south carolina senator lindsey graham deliberately invoked the pledge ruling at the roberts confirmation hearings all of this comes on the heels of our prior pledge resolution in 2003 that directed the president to appoint and the senate to confirm circuit judges who would supposedly interpret the constitution consistent with the constitutions text today is the next step we urge the supreme court to accept an appeal to resolve the conflict between the circuit courts over the constitutionality of the pledge while drafters have tried to use the most subtle phrase possible in this series of resolutions their intent is clear the resolutions demand the promotion of judges who fall in line with a specific series of conservative ideals and a specific result on the merits our judiciary was meant to be inde pendent our founding fathers created three distinct branches of government to ensure that no single body could write interpret and enforce the laws all at the same time todays resolution is part of a series that overreaches the bounds between the legislature and the judiciary and attempts to make puppets of our judges our judges should be impartial arbiters which they cannot be if they are manipulated by the congress further the model code of judicial conduct reveals that no candidate for a judgeship make pledges or promises or conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance of the duties of the office nor make statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court so not
