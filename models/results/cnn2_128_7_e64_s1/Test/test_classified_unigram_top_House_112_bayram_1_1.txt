prevention of suicide although suicide affects thousands of americans each year i would like to take a moment to focus specifically on our veterans and the men and women who are currently serving in our united states military suicides are increasing at an alarming rate this year for our soldiers sailors airmen and marines recent data shows that suicides are occurring at a rate of approximately one per day for the military this makes suicide the secondleading cause of death for our troops surpassed only by combat the army in particular has seen a 22 percent suicide increase when comparing the first 7 months in both 2011 and 2012 but these are not just numbers and statistics these are real soldiers and real families impacted by this growing tragedy this increase became very personal for

death a loving family and nation grieve with loss on behalf of bobby and his family i stand before you today to briefly discuss this growing trend and associated symptoms as well as highlight prevention efforts within my district and nationwide by both the departments of defense and veterans affairs more than 2 million troops have served in the wars in iraq and afghanistan and thats a lot of people who have seen war up close and personal it can affect some of them adversely when they come back home in fiscal year 2009 alone 1 868 veterans of these wars made suicide attempts faced with the stigma of posttraumatic stress disorder unemployment rates tipping 12 percent for our veterans and a loss of the military camaraderie many veterans report feeling purposeless upon returning home we are aware of three conditions that contribute to many of the suicides of our veterans and they are posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd traumatic brain injury tbi and depression we know that veterans with these three medical conditions are at a higher risk of succumbing to suicide behavior as friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our country there are some things that we can do first recognize the symptoms that could lead to serious problems understand where and how to get assistance while still part of the military and know the availability of treatment after service as

listened to some enormously bipartisan commentary about jobs as mr waxman knows our ranking member we have been working on creating jobs for a very long time democrats are hoping for a vote in the other body on the presidents american jobs act in the last congress although we documented 3 million jobs i can assure you that our stimulus package created millions of jobs unrecorded because it was emergency funding that did not require that recording my amendment speaks to clarity and it is not conflicting with jobs for those of you who are listening to this debate its about the industrial boiler industry they do have jobs and i frankly believe that the regulations that they have lived with do not impair their ability to promote jobs what most people dont know is there is an indefinite language or allows an indefinite time frame for noncompliance theres no time line for the industry to comply with clean air rules impacting our children just like this little one being seen by a nurse suffering from any number of respiratory illnesses so the bill in its current form also gives the epa discretion to go beyond 5 years you know how long that is that may be jobkilling time because when businesses look to move to areas even if theyre older industry they want to know that there is an effort made to create a better quality of life this amendment will help the industry it indicates that the time for compliance is 3 years and yes there may be discretion to expand but 3 years i believe this is a fair approach because in actuality the rule that the epa has passed has resulted in 1 7 million tons of reduction in air pollution per year thats a good thing for job creation and so this amendment is a simple approach to indicating that outdoor air pollution is damaging small particles and ground level ozone come from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions why wouldnt we want to improve the quality of life i can only say to you that out of those polluting elements come chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever sneezing shortness of breath and a number of other ailments so my amendment is a good thing to be able to talk about jobs clarity knowing when you must comply and preventing premature deaths and protecting our children but let me say what else this bill does this bill causes an extra 1 million in new discretionary spending by the epa to comply were supposed to be in a budgettight atmosphere were supposed to be budget cutting but my friends that is not what were doing here so i would simply say that even though my good friend indicates that 200 000 jobs would be saved with this particular bill i dont know where the documentation is but i will assure you that areas where the boiler industry is that have a defined clarity on what the timeframe is for making sure that youre in compliance i can assure you that that creates jobs and that creates a clean atmosphere quality of life and clean air for more industry to come into your states for you to diversify so i ask my colleagues to support a simple amendment that ensures that the compliance is for 3 years clarifying that to the industry giving them a time certain to comply and also giving discretion to the epa to help america grow jobs i hope we all will join in growing jobs in voting for the american jobs act and right now i hope that well vote for the jackson lee amendment that gives clarity in timeframe for compliance and again saves lives like this little ones that we all want to protect with that i yield back the balance of my time and i ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment mr chair i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2250 the epa regulatory relief act my amendment requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with environmental protection agency epa rules no later than 3 years after the rules have been finalized currently the bill requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with epa rules no earlier than five years after the rules have been finalized the bill also allows indefinite noncompliance there is no deadline set for industry compliance the bill in its current form also gives the epa the discretion to extend the 5 year deadline for compliance the epa would have the authority to extend a three year deadline as well the three year deadline i proposed can be extended by the epa while setting a goal that shows our firm commitment to saving lives i have offered this amendment to ensure that the epa has the ability to reduce toxic emissions from numerous industrial sources including the industrial boiler industry as they are required to do under the clean air act the epa has issued clean air rules targeting 170 different types of facilities which have resulted in a 1 7 million ton reduction in air pollution per year epa rules are now being finalized for both the industrial boiler industry and cement kiln industry and these bills are intended to indefinitely delay compliance with epas maximum achievable control technology mact standards prior to their promulgation as the representative for houston the countrys energy capital i am committed to creating an environment in which the energy industry and regulating agencies can work together for more than 40 years the epa has been charged with protecting our environment there has been a consistent theme of chipping away at the ability of the epa to protect our air we have to consider the long term costs to public health if we fail to establish reasonable measures for clean air outdoor air pollution is caused by small particles and ground level ozone that comes from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions outdoor air quality is also affected by pollen from plants crops and weeds particle pollution can be high any time of year and are higher near busy roads and where people burn wood when we inhale outdoor pollutants and pollen this can aggravate our lungs and can lead us to developing the following conditions chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever lethargy sneezing shortness of breath throat irritation and watery eyes outdoor air pollution and pollen may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma there are serious costs to our long term health the epa has promulgated rules and the public should be allowed to weigh in to determine if these rules are effective the purpose of having so many checks and balances within the epa is to ensure that the needs of industries and the needs of our communities are addressed providing a time for individuals to support or oppose any regulations is a meaningful first step this bill is a step in the wrong direction the epa has spent years reviewing these standards before attempting to issue regulations the proposed regulations to the industrial boiler industry will significantly reduce mercury and toxic air pollution from power plants and electric utilities the epa estimates that for every year this rule is not implemented mercury and toxic air pollution will have a serious impact on public health think for a moment about the lives that can be saved we are talking about thousands of health complications and deaths what more do we need to know according to the natural resources defense council this rule would prevent the following 9 000 premature deaths 5 500 heart attacks 58 000 asthma attacks 6 000 hospital and emergency room visits 6 000 cases of bronchitis 440 000 missed work days this legislation not only presents a threat to public health it also blatantly violates the cutgo spending provision the epa regulatory relief act requires the epa to select a regulatory option that is least burdensome to the industrial boiler industry regardless of alternate options that may be more feasible or cost effective the congressional budget office cbo estimates that this bill will result in 1 million dollars in new discretionary spending by the epa and the bill does not offset the authorization i understand the economic impacts of regulation but we must also act responsibly we cannot ignore the public health risks of breathing polluted air nor can we pretend that these emissions do not exacerbate global warming alternatively we certainly do not want to hinder job creation and economic growth congress passed the clean air act to allow the epa to ensure that all americans had access to clean air and we must not strip the agency of that right my friends on the other side of the aisle will tell you that this act is going to save more than 200 000 american jobs but what about the lives we will lose we do not want to hinder economic prosperity and robust job creation but let us strive toward an economic climate where jobs can be created by implementing technology to reduce dangerous toxic emissions and protect the american people it does not have to be one way or the other in a country of vast innovation surely we can forge a path forward in which we do not have to choose between creating jobs and saving lives lest we forget since 1999 houston has exchanged titles with los angeles for the poorest air quality in the nation the poor air quality is attributed to the amount of aerosols particles of carbon and sulfates in the air the carcinogens found in the air have been known to cause cancer particularly in children the epa is the very agency charged with issuing regulations that would address this serious problem this bill may very well jeopardize the air that we breathe the water that we drink our public lands and our public health by deep funding cuts in priority initiatives mr chair there are times in which we are 50 individual states and there are times when we exist as a single nation with national need one state did not defend the nation after the attacks on pearl harbor one state on its own did not end segregation and establish civil rights every so often there comes an issue so vital we must unite beyond our districts and beyond our states and act as a nation and protecting the quality of our air is one of those times i encourage my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment in order to uphold the epas authority

afghans gets closer and closer none of this has been easy progress has been made through hard fighting and considerable sacrifice of so many americans and our allies there have been tough losses along the way and there have been setbacks as well as successes but instead of debating a resolution that honors the sacrifice of our brave warfighters we are considering a measure that seeks to turn off the lights and slam the door as we withdraw well weve been down this road before two decades ago we celebrated alongside our afghan allies as the invading russian military rolled back into the ussr in defeat and when the celebration ended we walked awaywe did not followup with the necessary investments in diplomacy and development assistance turning our back on afghanistan and pakistan had we not done that in the early 1990s we would have better secured our own countrys future as well as peace and stability in the region instead of intensifying our humanitarian efforts to help the afghans meet their postwar challenges we simply walked awayleaving a destroyed country that lacked roads schools and any plan or hope for rebuilding into this void marched the taliban and alqaeda my colleagues as

and the reason is because that brazilian cotton agreement was a wto agreement that president obama agreed to the money is restored so if that helps clarify things and if not let me know i want to just remind everyone if you want to help hungry people youve got to have the money to do it now both parties have overspent for every dollar we spend 40 cents is borrowed both parties under president bush in an 8year period of time the debt went up 3 5 trillion now under president obama in a 3year period of time its gone up 5 trillion a 56 percent increase and president obama now owns the wars in iraq and libya and afghanistan in terms of this is his watch he has had opportunity to change the direction he has not done so so lets quit hiding behind were at war and therefore its the republicans fault i also want to remind my friends that the only budget that has passed either house is the ryan budget which is what were operating under the president of the united states budget failed on the senate floor 970 he did not even get harry reids vote so were operating under the budget constraints that we have let me say thisvery important about the wic program from february 2010 to february 2011 the number of participants has dropped 300 000 the level now is 8 7 million we will make sure no one falls through the cracks there are three contingency funds which can be drawn on if that happens and i want to point out for all the screaming and hollering and the selfrighteousness last year the democrats cut wic by 562 million and put the money into an unrelated account that had nothing to do with hunger it was a political settlement where was the screaming and hollering then and i want to say this in terms of the world food program if we want to help these countriesand i am committed to itwe

leaders on both sides of the capitol and leaders in both parties who are now advising this as well as individuals in the administration it is my opinion that we should not it would be foolish it would have a downside and we should think very very carefully before we go expanding the wars that were already involved in were in two major wars with iraq and afghanistan and that involves pakistan and yemen already so to go into libya now and impose a nofly zonewe have to remember a nofly zone is an act of war what moral right do we have to participate in war activity against libya libya hasnt done anything to the united states theyre not a threat to our national security theres been no aggression theres no constitutional authority for a president to willynilly go and start placing nofly zones over countries around the world we tried this in the 1990s and did it for 8 or 9 years we had a nofly zone along with sanctions and blockades around iraq finally it ended up with war and the wars were based on lies and then when that happened they said yes but it was well worth it because we got rid of a bad guy but we also lost close to 4 500 american military people 30some thousand suffered severe injuries and hundreds of thousands are applying now for disability because we went to war when we shouldnt have gone to war to expand this war now makes no sense whatsoever its against international law it challenges the war powers resolution for that reason we should stop and think congress should act im preparing to introduce a resolution next week that it is the sense of congress that the executive branch cant do this without approval from the congress why should we do this do you think it will cost some money yes it is going to cost a ton of money innocent people will be killed you cant just all of a sudden turn a switch and say dont fly over libya you have to bomb a lot of antiaircraft sites and a lot of military establishments so the war is on from my viewpoint this is the kind of thing that has been going on too long it contributes significantly to our bankruptcy and we are now spending approximately 1 trillion a year maintaining our empire around the world we are in the process of remaking all the borders and leadership in the middle east and central asia and now in north africa were getting involved we have invested 70 billion trying to prop up a dictator in egypt and look at how that ended up now we are hustling around to find out who the next dictator is so if we get involved im not sure they even know who to bomb and which one and who is going to come out on top that is an internal matter it is a civil war that is going on we can cheer for one side or the other but that is not a justification to place the burden on the american people both militarily and individually as well as monetarily some would say yes that sounds good i agree and as long as we get approval from the u n and nato it will be okay but you know that is just really a copout what army and air force and technology does the u n have and what does nato have you get a resolution at the u n that says lets take out this bad guy and do these things or nato does it they are all of our airplanes and all our money and no matter what anything and everything that goes wrong the united states will be blamed for it there is enough resentment against us already for pretending that we can tell every other country how to live the best way to look at this i believe is how would we as a people and how would we as a congress respond if we were a weaker nation and there was a stronger nation if they came and imposed a nofly zone over us or had sanctions against us or had a blockade we wouldnt accept that that would unify us so i dont buy into this thing that this is the only humanitarian thing we can do expand the war if we want to do something for humanity we need a new foreign policy we need a foreign policy that isnt built on militarism its built on more cooperation and more trade and not picking our dictators look at what happened after we picked a dictator for iran sure it lasted for 25 years or so but eventually it radicalized the islamists and they had a revolution and we came out on the short end of that so i think it is time that we reassess this and think about a policy that makes a lot more sense economically we need to do it"],

the reimbursement or excuse me the spending reduction act since may 2 when osama bin laden was taken out and we learned more about the role that pakistan is playingor shall i say not playingin the war on terror they have become more and more an unfaithful ally president bush said when the war on terror began to the countries throughout the world either you are with us or you are with the terrorists pakistan has yet to prove which side they are really on so much so that when osama bin laden was taken out by the american military we did not trust pakistan enough to even tell them that we were going to come into their country our distrust against that country has been proven over and over again since that date on may 16 the wall street journal reported that over 40 percent of the money that pakistan requests for reimbursement for military aid is denied by the federal government because those claims are unfounded by the federal government in one case last year the united states paid millions of dollars to refurbish four helicopters to help pakistans army transport troops into battle against the taliban but it turned out that pakistan diverted three of those aircraft to peacekeeping duties in sudan operations for which pakistan receives compensation from the united nations other claims include a 26 million charge for barbed wire and pickets and 70 million for radar maintenance although there is no enemy air threat related to the war on terror and on may 22 15 to 20 militants stormed three hangars at the naval aviation base in karachi it took the pakistan military over 15 hours to end that siege two unitedstates p3cs were destroyed the p3c is an antisubmarine and marine surveillance aircraft some reports now indicate it was an inside job as the terrorists had military uniforms and knew exactly where the planes were located then on june 14 reports confirmed that pakistan now has arrested cia informants that helped us locate osama bin laden where he had been living under the eyes of the pakistan military for years as reported in the new york times on june 14 isi arrested 30 pakistani informants who helped the united states capture bin laden one was a pakistani army major who officials said copied the license plates of cars visiting bin ladens compound at abbottabad then further in june when cia director leon panetta went to pakistan to inform them that there was a factory that was making bombs or ieds that could be used against americans by the time the pakistani troops showed up the militants had disappeared not to be outdone we told them again about a second place where ieds were being made more bombmaking facilities only days later and once again the terrorists picked up and disappeared sounds like they had inside information and lastly on june 29 pakistan asked the united states to shut down a drone base that it had in islamabad and ended unitedstates operations at the shamsi air base although the united states denies that occurred pakistans defense minister said that it has ended those operations and of course drones carry out strikes against the taliban and al qaeda militants on pakistans

than what we are doing here today and i thank the manager mr mcgovern and the gentleman from south carolina for recognizing through the leadership of our house that the american people must be engaged in the constitutional duties that have been set out for the three branches of government under the constitution the war powers are divided between congress and the president and among other relevant grants congress has the power to declare war and raise and support armed forces while the president is the commander in chief the congressional duties fall under article 1 section 8 and the commander in chief can relate his or her duties to article 2 section 2 it is generally agreed that the commander in chief role gives the president power to utilize the armed services to repel attacks against the united states but there has long been a challenge or controversy over whether he or she is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or congressional authorization and so here we are today indicating that it is important for the commander in chief no matter how much respect there is to be able to respond to the call of the congress there are now two resolutions that swirl around the violence and horrific acts in libya compounding the problem is a continued violence an assault on the people of libya so for a moment let me focus on general qadhafi to ask him the question is he reasoned and does he recognize that the slaughter of his people must stop the president of south africa engaged in peace talks with general qadhafi and many of us thought that the white flag would be raised and that there would be an opportunity for resolution we see that not coming so my message to general qadhafi is to stop this senseless and violent war to allow your people to accumulate the privileges of human dignity that is to be able to live in peace and hopefully to secure democratic rights for themselves but at the same time we in the united states cannot stand by and watch as violence proceeds we must have procedure we must have process i believe the boehner amendment gives at least some tracking as to what you are asking the president for but i still quarrel with the debate and the question as to whether or not that is enough i am supporting this rule so that we can move forward to begin to debate this question of the war

friday were going to go friday to noon and friday through dinner and all night long on friday night we finished at 5 on saturday morning i jumped on the first flight out of national flew home did a town hall meeting no later than 3 hours after we adjourned that saturday morning i was on fire because this house gave every single member a chance to offer every single amendment that their

able to handle it im with you mr hastings if youre ready to go those days and nights ill do them with you but we did that those 12 appropriations bills we did that in this body not all in one package but one at the time at the time and the senate said no our choice here today is do we close the doors at these agencies do we close the doors on these social services do we go through another one of those government shutdown scenarios that benefit absolutely no one or do we do the right thing which is observe our budget caps continue to reduce spending thats right you know as well as i do on these appropriations bills on this discretionary spending we spent less in 2011 than they spent in 2010 we spent less in 2012 than we spent in 2011 and if we pass this bill well spend less in 2013 than we spent in 2012 it hasnt happened since before world war ii three years in a row of this body coming together and telling the american people we can do better with less thats what this bill is about today again strong supporter of this rule strong supporter of the two underlying measures i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.004451572895050049, 0.49554842710494995, 0, "i rise today in
