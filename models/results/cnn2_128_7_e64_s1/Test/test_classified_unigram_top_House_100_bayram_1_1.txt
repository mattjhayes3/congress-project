participation of american athletes in the 1988 winter and summer olympic games not only will these coins commemorate american participation but they will also help raise badly needed funds for the training of our athletes even today across america thousands of athletes are training hard with a goal of being named to the 1988 unitedstates olympic teams many of these athletes are making tremendous personal sacrifices in the hope of being able to represent their country in the contests at the pinnacle of sport they are putting in thousands of hours of arduous and often lonely practice with the goal of being able to stand on the victory platform with a gold medal on their chests while the american flag is raised and our national anthem is played and millions look on around the world in 1982 congress authorized the minting of commemorative coins for the 1984 los angeles olympic games the sale of those coins raised 73 5 million for the unitedstates olympic committee and the los angeles olympic organizing committee that money made it possible for the unitedstates olympic committee in 1984 to distribute 6 4 million to the national governing bodies which are the amateur sports organizations responsible for goveming the conduct and promotion of particular amateur sports that amount represented twothirds of the amount the usoc gave to the national governing bodies in 1984 this money played no small role in enabling unitedstates athletes to win more medals at the 1984 los angeles olympics than any country ever won at a single olympics in addition the usoc used 31 7 million in coin money to help fund the unitedstates olympic foundation which it founded in 1984 to foster unitedstates participation in national and international amateur sports competitions through the support of amateur sports organizations in this country another 10 8 million in coin money originally paid to the laooc was also paid into the foundation the olympic coin money has been a tremendous boost to the usoc but costs for unitedstates participation in the games continue to rise at a rapid rate this new coin program will help raise millions of badly needed dollars so that american athletes can have the types of training facilities necessary for them to fully realize their potential and perform at the peak of their abilities at the games the legislation authorizes the minting of 1 million gold coins and 10 million silver coins the coins will be sold directly by the unitedstates mint to the public and will carry a surcharge that will be paid to the unitedstates olympic committee solely to train unitedstates olympic athletes to support local or community amateur athletic programs and to erect facilities for the training of such athletes in addition the legislation requires that the coins be sold at no net cost to the unitedstates government i am pleased to be the sponsor of this legislation i hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring it as a means of supporting our unitedstates olympic athletes"], [0.020938456058502197, 0.9790615439414978, 1, "i rise today in support of the defense conference agreement i would like to commend the conferees for the outstanding work they performed in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience

said it is not possible for civilization to flow backwards while there is youth in the world the challenge before us is that of providing all our children the opportunity to become productive citizens the relationship between the family home and the workplace has a profound effect on the lives of our children in 1955 60 percent of the households in the united states consisted of a working father a housewife mother and two or more schoolage children in 1980 that family unit was only 11 percent and in 1985 it was 7 percent an astonishing change more than 50 percent of women are in the work force with the percentage increasing according to the census 59 percent of the children born in this country in 1983 will live with only one parent before reaching the age of 18 the united states has the highest adolescent birth rate of any idustrialized nation each year half a million children are born to children under the age of 17 in fact every day 40 teenage girls give birth to their third child being the third child of a child certainly puts ones future very much at risk as we are well aware the statistics about children and poverty are staggering one child in four is born into poverty singleparent femaleheaded households living in poverty in this country have increased dramatically from 2 4 to 3 4 million between 1975 and 1985 nearly 40 percent of all such households live in poverty in 1986 of households with children under 6 years old 2 8 million were headed by women and 1 7 million of these families were poor being supportive of a childs development under these circumstances is difficult at best to permit large numbers of citizens to grow up uneducated illhoused and underfed not only limits future productivity but undermines the integrity of our strength as a nation public policy debates regarding the welfare and future of our children cannot ignore the interrelationship of the family structure our system of education and training and the workplace environment the education and training individuals receive influence and often determine the type of job they can hold their jobs in turn contribute heavily to the standard of living enjoyed by their families public policy changes made to revamp or retool the workplace will also have a major impact on the home the stakes in this debate are particularly high for children one program that has been part of the public policy debate in this area over the past 20 years is the work incentive program it was established in 1967 with the purpose of providing skill assessments job training and employment placement to help afdc recipients become selfsupporting unfortunately the program has not achieved its potential it has however managed to weather criticism and serious efforts to eliminate its funding recently though new support has surfaced for the win program this support is due to the great strides made in recent years under the win demonstration program authority as part of the provisions of the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation act states could for the first time as part of their regular programs require afdc recipients to work in public or nonprofit agencies in return for their welfare benefits in addition greater flexibility was given to the win program to fund onthejob training programs by diverting recipients welfare grants into wage subsidies for private employers the intent of these innovative programs has been to provide the means by which welfare recipients can be moved into gainful employment with the flexibility permitted under win demonstration programs states have begun to offer a mix of services ranging from basic skills education to sophisticated training as well as more traditional community work experience and what is now known as workfare in which clients undertake public service for a period of time in exchange for their grants the most discussed of these programs is the massachusetts etchoices program which has placed more than 30 000 welfare recipients and applicants in unsubsidized jobs the program is expected to save massachusetts taxpayers 107 million in reduced welfare benefits and increased tax revenues this year since its inception the et program has helped to reduce the welfare caseload by 4 percent my own state of vermont has initiated a similar program called up reach which is designed to consolidate at the state level many existing employment and training programs including win registration for the program is required of all afdc recipients who do not have federally defined exemptions it is voluntary for all other recipients training education career planning support services and job seeking opportunities are provided to program participants there is close interaction with potential employers so that meaningful jobs are available for program participants upon completion it is reasonable to expect that ablebodied individuals seek employment and that federal policy should encourage individuals to choose a life of selfsufficiency for many inadequate education and lack of training and work experience constitute major barriers to obtaining productive employment the opportunity to obtain education training and work experiences under win should be strengthened we also cannot ignore the issue of child careits availability affordability and quality unless we address in a comprehensive manner the education training and support needs of this significant segment of our population the longterm results could jeopardize our productivity competitiveness and standing as a world leader not only do we lose the contribution of the adults already dependent on government subsidy but we increase the chances that their children will be at even greater risk of continuing this dependency as a nation we

consumer protection and competitiveness in those hearings the need for longterm care legislation is clear i have heard from families and individuals whose life savings were reduced to a shambles because of their need for longterm care i have heard testimony attesting to the need for a system that will provide worryfree care for the elderly in homes across the nation senior citiiens are being forced into poverty by their needs for health care indeed they and their families are becoming slaves to the need for professional qualified home health care these votes come on the heels of the catastrophic health care bill passed last week the passage of that bill is an essential part of the package of health care for seniors its passage alone was predicated on the promises of the 100th congress to do more for the elderly the promises made by this congress and by past congresses have reached a do or die stage if we do not act on our promises we will lose the opportunity to help once that opportunity is lost millions will suffer the significance of this bill is more than procedural the days of the 100th congress are coming down to the wire after today there will be less

eloquent remarks and for the leadership that the gentleman has shown over the years in this issue yes as we all can see if we will allow our eyes and ears and our minds to see another year has come and gone and the cypriot problem persists with no solution to be had it was the early morning hours of july 20 1974 that turkish paratroopers began descending on the island republic on the pretext that they were undertaking a peace operation intended to protect the turkish cypriot minority in the wake of the political turmoil then enveloping the country this socalled peace operation however was codenamed attila and was effectively an unlawful invasion and occupation of an independent country in violation of every tenet of international law custom and behavior the fact is that attila was not a peace operation at all it was an operation undertaken in order to achieve the partitionist plans of the turkish and turkishcypriot people it was indeed successful in meeting that goal for attila and attila ii on august 14 1974 effectively took over almost 40 percent of the territory of the republic while killing thousands of greek cypriots raping others uprooting 200 000 of them from their homes and looting and stealing from the homes and churches that they were forced to leave behind to make matters worse not only were these atrocities carried out but they were carried out with the use of supplies and equipment provided turkey by the united statesin violation of the unitedstates foreign assistance act of 1962 which authorizes the use of american aid solely for defensive purposes thirteen years have passed since that time and the years have seen several initiatives undertaken toward a solution a solution however has not been attained the reason is not that one is unattainable rather the sad reason for the stalemate is that turkey and the turkish cypriots have not negotiated toward a solution in good faith and have in fact taken a series of steps intended to achieve the permanent partion of the republic of cyprus turkey and the turkishcypriot leadership in direct violation of relevant u n resolutions have indeed taken a series of actions subsequent to the 1974 invastion which are aimed at consolidating the occupation and division of the small mediterranean republic facts speak louder than words so i will cite the evidence first and foremost turkey refused and to date still refuses to comply with international requests and pertinent u n resolutions to remove its occupation troops from the republic of cyprus to add insult to injury not only do they refuse to withdraw their troops but turkey has recently begun a military buildup on cyprus in both manpower and equipment to where today there are an estimated 34 000 to 35 000 turkish troops on cyprus with the number of tanks having more than doubled for a total of over 300 furthermore in an effort to further consolidate their illegal presence on the island turkey has moved in more than 60 000 mainland settlers who are threatening to turn the turkish cypriots themselves into a minority while occupying the homes and properties that the greekcypriots were forced to leave behind when they were turned into refugees in their own land in addition turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership is subjecting the greek cypriots to further indignity by systematically and intentionally destroying the christian and hellenic cultural heritage in the turkish occupied part of the island yes the greek cypriots have since the landing of the mainland troops and to this day been subjected to the pillaging theft and destruction of the artifacts and works of art that tell the story of their identity they have seen their ancient churches used as stables and warehouses they have seen their icons and other works of religious art stolen and they have seen their hellenic antiquities sold to private collectors throughout the world in order no doubt to systematically remove any trace of the cultural heritage which represents the national identity of the occupied areas as if these facts were not enough the partitionist aims of the turkish and turkishcypriot leadership were made crystal clear to the world when as recently as november 15 1983 they undertook an attempt to create a new turkish political entity in occupied cyprus yes they declared the northern occupied part of cyprus to be an independent country and called this pseudostate the turkish republic of northern cyprus fortunately law and logic prevailed and the international community almost unanimously withheld their recognition of the pseudostate and criticized the action i say almost unanimously withheld for the one exception and i underline one exception was turkey for turkey was the only country in the world community to grant its recognition to this illegal entity how i ask can turkey possibly pretend that they want and work toward the return of peace and unity to the republic of cyprus when they are a party to such destructive actions to the process how can they pretend to want to work with the u n secretarygeneral to find a workable solution to the situation when they ignore his expressions of concern as well as those of the united states over the military buildup on cyprus that turkey is engaging in by replying as turkish foreign minister halefoglu did on june 6 1987 that the evidence is ridiculous and untrue and that turkey does not have to answer to anyone on the number of troops and military equipment it has on cyprus i declare that turkey does have to answer for its actions and further i maintain that they should answer to the people of the united states it is the united states after all as i said earlier that supplies and equips turkey with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid each year and it is the united states that they are giving a slap in the face to when they knowingly and intentionally fail to comply with the restrictions we place on that assistance the unitedstates congress is on record with its sound conviction that there can be no resolution of the cyprus conflict unless and until the turkish troops are removed from the island rather than comply however turkey laughs in our faces and increases its military presence there and does so with no less than united states origin equipment even while both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee report out legislation prohibiting the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus congress position on the cyprus issue is clear both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee have reported out legislation that would prohibit the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus in the senate the foreign aid authorization bill contains the pell amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied military equipment from turkey to cyprus in the house the foreign aid bill contains language broomfieldyatronsnowe amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied arms from either turkey or greece to cyprus both bills also maintain the traditional 7 10 funding ratio between greece and turkey this legislation is anything but a radical approach to this critical problem instead it merely clarifies the intent of congress as expressed in the foreign assistance act i strongly support this legislation because i believe it would be repugnant to the rule of law that we talked about here earlier when the gentleman from california had his special order which is recognized in our constitution for the united states to support in a direct or indirect way this illegal occupation and division of cyprus i take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to likewise support this necessary legislation to make matters worse turkey has the unmitigated gall to inform the state department that it is reconsidering implementing the alreadyagreed to extension of our base rights agreement because of all things congress attitude on the cyprus issue heaven help us i think that the united states and we as legislators have been more than patient and have tolerated an intolerable situation more than long enough i believe that it is now time to implement action in order to force turkey to cease the actions that are preventing an appropriate resolution to the cypriot problem despite our security interests in a strong security interest in a strong relationship with turkey and god knows they are there and those of us who care about america are concerned with the fact that turkey is in a very strategic position as is the country of greece and as is the independent republic of cyprus we must no longer tolerate such intransigence by the leadership in ankara without strong united opposition by the united states to turkish efforts to ensure the permanent partition of cyprus we cannot expect peace to be achieved in that country in the near future cyprus has always been a good friend to the united states and we should do whatever we can to help bring about a just solution cyprus is after all not only strategically important to the peace of the region but it has proven itself time and again to be a good friend and ally of the united states it was for example cyprus not turkey that allowed the united states the use of its facilities to carry supplies to our dying marines in lebanonturkey refused it has furthermore offered us its unrestrictive assistance after the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the bombing of our embassy in beirut in 1984 and during the highjacking of twa flight 847 in 1985 and while we are at it it was the greeks who fought and died heroically in world war ii while turkey chose neutrality and though it is little known it was 38 greeks who joined 6 unitedstates marines to win a military victory in 1805 on the shores of tripoli the same victory i might add that is immortalized in the marine hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and i ask what has turkey contributed to the security of the west that is an open question turkey for example during the 1973 middle east war granted moscow overflight rights and overland passage rights to resupply syria and egypt while refusing united states overflights rights to resupply israel and among other questionable acts allowed soviet aircraft carriers passage through the dardanelles in violation of the montreux convention of 1936 and over nato objections we as legislators and we as americans must therefore do all in our power to bring about a just and lasting solution to the cypriot issue we must condition aid to turkey on her genuine efforts to reach just such a solution and we must push to see that this solution meets certain minimum conditions of acceptability including first the immediate withdrawal of all turkish occupation forces and colonists from cyprus second the immediate return of all occupied areas to the republic of cyprus under u n auspices for the immediate resettlement of the 200 000 greek cypriot refugees third an agreement by turkey and the turkishcypriots to a constitutional arrangement based on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule with full minority rights guaranteed as well as freedom of movement settlement and ownership anywhere in cyprus after all should there be a green line there i think not fourth an agreement by turkey to full cooperation with the international red cross regarding investigation of the five abducted americans and the 1 614 missing greek cypriots i might add that this factor in the cypriot issue has unfortunately not received as much international attention and concern as it might have and rightfully deserves the fact is that much like the americans missing in vietnam 1 619 individuals including 5 americans have been missing since the turkish invasion of cyprus clearly any fair and appropriate resolution of the issue must fully and adequately address the fate of these unfortunate victims and their families and so in closing i say on behalf of all three nations over there on behalf of american security and american interests in that entire area let us all work in earnest to return peace and unity to the republic of cyprus the cards are after all largely in our hands let us deal a fair and appropriate hand"]], "top_unsure": [[3.874301910400391e-06,

have two big problems with the sdi program the first problem is that the sdi office is not implementing the program that the president has promised to the people of our nation president reagan back in june of 1986 said to a group of schoolchildren in new jersey our strategic defense initiative might one day enable us to put in space a shield that missiles cannot penetrate a shield that could protect us from nuclear missiles just as a roof protects a family from rain now that is an important goal and a beautiful sentiment and that is what the president of our nation promised the people of this nation unfortunately that is not what the sdi office is doing general abramson recently said nowhere have we stated that the goal of the sdi is to come up with a leakproof defense the problem my colleagues s that the president has promised the people protection but in reality what the sdi office is doing is giving us not a population defense but a system that will protect military establishments and improve our deterrence if we want more deterrence we can just buy it by building the midgetman or beefing up existing offensive systems we do not need to spend an incredible amount of money on stars wars to get more deterrence the second problem that i have with the present sdi program is that i fear that there will be cuts in research what the people of this nation want and have been promised is a robust research program they want to know if we can protect this nation from nuclear weapons and if it is possible then let us deploy as you can see from the chart the administration requested in excess of 5 billion for sdi in fiscal year 1989 based on the bennett amendment that just passed they could receive 3 5 billion the fear that we have that john spratt has and frank mccloskey and i have is that the sdio in their effort to make and promote an early deployment will take necessary and important research dollars and not put them in research but put them into deployment of a system that is not designed to protect the people of this nation that is the problem we have and that is why this amendment so the fact of the matter is this is not a tremendous amendment that wipes out star wars this is an amendment that says that since we spent 40 percent of this fiscal years money in sdio phase 1 let us limit next years spending to 40 percent too do not go to 50 percent stay at 40 percent that is all this amendment does it says that we want a strong research program let us make sure we have a robust research program by limiting the spending on phase 1 to 40 percent now the issue has been raised that there is a major concern relative to micromanagement that because we are saying let us have a 40percent limit instead of allowing 50 percent of the money to be spent on phase 1 that we are micromanaging that is absurd let me give my colleagues some examples take the air force this year they requested 14 9 billion for research and development to be spent on 268 line items meaning each line item is worth an average of about 56 million the navy requested 9 2 billion for 293 line items that we micromanage as a congress 32 million an item the army requested 5 billion for research and development they are going to spend that on 186 items what are we doing in star wars we were requested to spend 4 5 billion my colleagues there is one line item under star wars one line item it is worth 4 5 billion now if my colleagues are going to tell me that having a 40percent cap on phase 1 is micromanagement we have to talk about what the definition of management is the fact of the matter is that it is time for some minimum management and that is what this program does it lets them spend a tremendous about of money on phase 1 it just says to limit the total spending for phase 1 to 40 percent of the total sdi budget in fiscal year 1989 the same percentage as in fiscal year 1988 i think everyone who supports sdi wants a robust research program but what we do not want is to have that money spent on phase 1 deployment items which get us away from what the president promised the people of this nation which is a robust research program that defends everybody so my colleagues can support sdi and my colleagues can support the spratt amendment this makes sense this is not micromanagement and so if my colleagues want a robust research

death fell over indochina it wasnt until the boat people came out a few years later that most americans became aware that the communist death squads went throughout all of south vietnam and executed somewhere between 60 000 and 68 000 people a small figure of horror and death when compared to the 2 million that died in cambodia but the nightmare of communist persecution the concentration camps euphemistically titled reeduca tion camps all of that has stayed for the last 12 years it has been a nightmare for many of the friends we left behind well those americans who suffered the most are the american families of the missinginacti6n who were eventually transferred into the category of the presumptive finding of death this coming tuesday night for all my colleagues and for the members of the other body i am sponsoring a screening of the film hanoi hilton it has only opened in new york and los angeles to date but i will for the members make available this beautiful moving tribute to our men including a former member of this house who is now in the other body john mccain and a great senator for the last 6 years now retired to alabama jeremiah denton the torture that our prisoners underwent was not seen since the days of the gestapo in world war ii or stalins death camps in the gulag archipelago this film screening will be in the mumford room of the new james madison building of the library of congress it will start at 5 30 tuesday night i do not think it is in conflict with any other dinners or events or affairs that night i would hope that a good number of my colleagues will come out i will have more to say on that in a special order in about an hour from now on the floor of this house chamber"], [0.0013196170330047607, 0.49868038296699524, 1, "i move to strike the last word earlier this year i got some good news and some bad news the good news was that i got to be chairman of the subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations of the committee on the judiciary and can deal with a lot of exciting issues like the independent counsel the bad news is that private bills come with that territory so i am chairman of the subcommittee that is blessed to have the jurisdiction over these private bills the gentleman from illinois makes a very reasonable point i would hope that we would not go to a vote on his amendment because of the dilemma he finds himself in this being not a fully reasonable solution to a reasonable problem we are going to have a hearing in september on this bill and some others it is entirely reasonable for him to askand i will join in askingthat the foreign claims settlement commission payments be held off until we can deal with this years business there is this bill and maybe one or two others which we will be considering i do not think there would be any great hardship in waiting a couple of months the amendment in its terms would require a wait of much more than that but i would think that the treasuryand i would join the gentleman in asking for this and i am sure our ranking minority member would join uswould agree that they would not dispose of all the funds before we were able in september of this

possibility of related illnesses there is a moral obligation on the society which has benefited from the labors of workers to provide them with opportunities for and access to therapeutic assistance h r 162 would fulfill these responsibilities the program established under h r 162 will correct a serious deficiency in our nations public health systemthe lack of a clinical program for the prevention or reduction and eventual elimination of occupational diseases despite the widespread knowledge of workplace hazards and the increased publicity surrounding particular hazards in certain industries many workers who have left jobs in those particular environments are unaware that they are at increased risk of disease furthermore federal efforts to inform workers currently exposed to hazardous substances are extremely limited in scope and content and fail to provide the necessary counseling and followup assistance h r 162 is intended to correct these omissions we are not breaking new ground here the knowledge and technology exits to enable us to prevent occupational diseases or at least to detect the onset and arrest the progress of those diseases h r 162 will put that intelligence and those techniques to work in a comprehensive manner the program established by the bill will notify thousands of workers of their increased risk to occupational diseases provide the individuals with access to trained counselors and health professionals in designated clinical facilities equipped to handle occupational illnesses and provide opportunities for the personal physicians of those individuals to acquire greater proficiency in the detection and treatment of occupational diseases so as to better serve their patients this legislation will achieve these crucial public health objectives in a costeffective fashion for the modest sum of 25 million a year we will begin to curb and eradicate occupational illnesses which cost the federal government several billion dollars annually in outlays for social security disability benefits and medicare medicaid costs h r 162 is necessary because currently there is no federal program that would achieve the objectives of this legislation neither osha niosh epa nor any other federal program is required to or has undertaken to identify worker populations at increased risk of disease to notify those workers and to offer the extensive assistance which will help them to avoid severe disabilities and premature death the legislation is feasible because the concept has bden tested successfully in pilot projects the proposal is fiscanly sound it can be carried out with a minimal expenditure of federal dollars and eventually will help to offset the billions of federal moneys being spent to support and treat workers disabled from workrelated diseases i want to express my deep appreciation for the manner in which the gentleman from pennsylvania has handled this measure in both the 99th and 100th congresses the gentleman held extensive hearings listening to testimony from many people with varying views for and against the bill after the hearings and through subcommittee and full committee mark ups the gentleman maintained an open mind consulted frequently with interested parties and made significant changes in the bill to accommodate concerns as a result the committee bill has picked up considerably more support from the business and scientific communities despite these achievements mr gaydos has continued working to accommodate other concerns and he will offer amendments today which reflect his success at consensus building i congratulate the gentleman from pennsylvania for an outstanding job in forging a coalition of support for this essential worker protection legislation i must say a few words about the substitute that will be offered by my good friend from vermont mr jeffords the ranking republican on the committee on education and labor i have the highest regard for the gentleman and i know that his motives are sincere however his substitute is just not the answer to the needs of workers who have been and are being exposed to hazardous substances in their workplaces i regret that i must oppose the gentlemans proposal but it is obvious that the substitute will not offer the kinds of special advice counsel and preventive measures that are embodied in the committee bill h r 162 workers deserve to know about their increased risk of occupational disease they deserve to be given an opportunity to obtain professional assistance which in many cases will help them to avoid severe disabilities and premature death i urge my colleagues to give workers that chance by adopting h r 162"], [0.001404881477355957, 0.501404881477356, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise in support of this bill which will create greater equity in our federal pay system the kind of study proposed in this bill was completed in connecticut and its recommendations informed our collectivebargaining process and allowed the correction of inequities that were built into our pay structure as a result of historic patterns of hiring and compensation historic patterns of hiring and compensation resulted from the very responsible functioning of the market many years ago the market was simply constrained women were only allowed to apply for certain jobs and so many applied and the salaries were low thereafter increases were granted across the board and there was no way to look back and correct for a market that functioned correctly but on the wrong assumptions and under a constrainedin a constrained age so when you look at the current situationin connecticut when we looked at that situation we found out that women in jobs that required a high school diploma typing skills and other things were entering at lower wages than men who were accepting jobs in maintainer 1 where they only had the hand tools to that level of description and that differential in pay where there were clear skill differences and responsibility differences were really the result of these historic patterns of hiring and compensation our study in connecticut identified those problems the results of the study informed the collectivebargaining process and gave those at the table the information they needed to correct the inequities thereafter instead of pay increases being given across the board 4 percent for everyone 2 percent was given and the other 2 percent was set aside in an equity fund that equity fund was distributed according to the results of the study and the inequities were corrected in other words hi connecticut this kind of study truly informed the collectivebargaining process and did have the effect in peoples lives of correcting longstanding inequities in a way that without the information and without the commitment the collectivebargaining process could not have done so i think this is an important bill equity in our hiring and

it is essential that we demonstrate strong bipartisan support for promoting a peaceful orderly transition to democracy in haiti the administration responded promptly and appropriately in cutting off all but humanitarian assistance to the government of haiti and i believe that decision was appropriate the perfecting language in this amendment provides the president with a whole range of options where he already has authority or clarifies his authority in bringing pressure to bear on the government of haiti to fulfill its obligations to the haitian people it must be made clear to the government of general namphy that the united states is prepared to cooperate with our allies in the region and to consider all possible alternatives to encourage a prompt and peaceful reinstatement of the electoral process it is imperative that we give our president the backing and the flexibility to carry out the diplomatic initiatives necessary to influence positively events in the caribbean we must support the haitian people so that they can live without fear and can reach the goils of economic development and personal security under a democratic government the language of this amendment reflects appropriately the sentiment of the house and i believe it also reflects the attitude of the administration we should give it our strong bipartisan support i commend the gentleman from
