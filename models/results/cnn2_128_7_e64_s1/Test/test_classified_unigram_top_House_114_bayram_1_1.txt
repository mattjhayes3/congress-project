the sale of baby body parts this grave circumstance has caused considerable concern because one of the underpinnings and socalled safeguards of the statute that allowed for the donation of fetal tissue for transplantation and research was that this tissue would not be sold the author of the statute former congressman henry waxman stated during floor debate in 1993 this amendment would enact the most important safeguards to prevent any sale of fetal issue for any purpose not just the purpose of research it would be abhorrent to allow for a sale of fetal tissue and a market to be created

allowing procurement business technicians to collect fetal tissue and organs from aborted babies immediately after an abortion is completed the brochure uses the words financially profitable fiscally

time it does so without raising taxes and it increases growth now the growth is important and our friends mentioned it on the other side of the aisle as if the policies that have been in place over the past 6 years had some magical solution that they increased growth in this country well the fact of the matter is that as we see it in this chartthis is from the congressional budget office the nonpartisan congressional budget office as my friend from maryland says these are the projections of growth that the congressional budget office has had over the last 4 years four years ago 3 0 percent the average as you all well know is about 3 3 percent over the last 40 years growth in this country that is in the economy growing every year 3 3 percent on average and the projection 4 years ago was that it would be 3 percent three years ago it was down to 2 9 percent 2 years ago 2 5 percent this year 2 3 percent this is lost jobs lost opportunity fewer dreams realized all because of the policies coming out of washington d c and our friends on the other side want to double down on those policies our proposal our budget that gets to balancewhich our friends on the other side of the aisle and their budget never does the presidents budget never gets to balance something that folks back home cant do they cant do it in their personal lives they cant do it in their businesses our budget gets to balance and increases growthincreases growthbecause that is what we have got to do we have got to increase growth in this economy so that more dreams can be realized more jobs can be created wages can be increased the way you increase wages is to increase the vitality of the economy not have washington dictate it to people and then this tired old characterization of our proposal to save and strengthen and secure medicare and the way that it is characterized is to voucherize it well this is nonsense and the american people know it what we propose to do is to save medicare not allow it to die on the vine which is what our friends on the other side of the aisle apparently want to do because when you read their policies they dont do anything to address the insolvency of medicare that is coming in a very short period of timenot according to me but according to the medicare trusteesand what that means is that patients seniors wont be able to get provided the services that they have been promised that is not the right thing to do our friends on the other side talk about all the tax loopholes and goodness knows we have been for cutting tax loopholes and closing tax loopholes before closing tax loopholes was cool we just cant get out and get folks to rally to the cause in a positive way from our friends on the other side of the aisle my friend from maryland knows that the way that that is fashioned is in the ways and means committee it is not in the budget committee the budget committee lays out the vision lays out the plan lays out the parameters that are

where healthcare costs are going right now healthcare costs are down that is right who are they down for they are down for the federal government who are they not down for the american people that is who they are not down for what we have done with the presidents healthcare program is to shift huge costshuge coststo the american people if you are an individual out there you make 30 000 40 000 50 000 right now and the coverage that you are able to purchase right nowbecause obamacare has a deduction has a deductible in your health plan of between 6 000 and 12 000 which countless americans have right now let me suggest that you dont have health coverage because you cant afford the deductible but that is the proposal that our friends on the other side of the aisle embrace that is the one that

growing crimes in the world according to the united states state department human trafficking is among the worlds top three criminal enterprises it is forced prostitution domestic slavery and forced labor which is why enactment and now the implementation of the jvta is so important we must continue to work to eradicate human trafficking and support the victims in the year since the jvtas enactment we have seen educators law enforcement officials and service providers working together democrats and republicans raising awareness in our communities that human trafficking is not merely an international phenomenon it unfortunately happens all too often in our backyards just as we have heard judge poe talk about t and talk about brooke and the stories could go on and on in fact in my

from a child and not to be able to provide love and care for that child is a stressful and tormenting episode for any parent for the families that adopted children in the drc this is exacerbated by the fact that their children are stuck in a country that has one of the worst healthcare systems in the world there are hundreds of families throughout the united statesand about 350 of them are waiting simply for an exit permitmissing their children and worried about the health of their children stuck in the drc the only thing that is preventing them from bringing their child or children home is this exit visa now our visas are valid only for 6 months unfortunately and i think as was mentioned it costs 325 to renew a visa even though really there is no work involved we have checked with the state department and there is minimal expense so this is not going to be a hit on the state departments budget but it is a hit on the budget of families some families have spent 1 000 over the past 2 years and since we dont know when the drc is going to start issuing these visas we dont know how much money these families are looking at in the future this bipartisan bill doesnt solve the exit problem but at least it solves the financial burden that we have put not intentionally on these families it is the right thing to do it will show support for these families during this

solution with the fdic that he had pushed and pushed until they actually adopted it it was a good solution in fact part of this bill would essentially codify that what it would say is you cant use firrea to go after whole sectors of the economy it has to be specifically and individually based you have to have a reason to believe that an individual business was engaged in fraud if you were going to use the banking system to get at them good solution constructive solution my hat is off to you sir unfortunately this bill as has been suggested earlier goes farther section 3 makes it a lot harder for the department of justice to investigate financial solutions because as has been suggested it takes direct and specific aim at the powers under firrea as the gentleman from minnesota had indicated it puts limits on them as to when subpoenas can be issued to me frankly that is a solution in search of a problem firrea has been the key statute in going after fraud that in fact helped lead to the great recession and the crisis and the wiping out of 13 trillion in net worth frankly i am one of those people who believes we need more prosecutions not fewer for all the damage and harm done to americans throughout this land i am very reluctant to embrace any language that substantially weakens or obstructs firreas ability to investigate fraud i do agree with my friend that investigations and our oversight of them could be improved by requiring a paper trail i worked with him to see if we could find a compromise that did that but we couldnt so ultimately we had to disagree and this is a disagreement that i will characterize as being a very strong one the truth of the matter is in the last two calendar years alone firrea was the operative statute which led to 40 billion in fines and recoveries being levied truth be told it is very very unlikely if not highly unlikely that any of those 40 billion in fines or restitution could have been recovered if the language of this legislation had been in effect 20 billion of which was restitution to harmed parties people who lost their homes inappropriately because they had had fraud perpetuated upon them i dont think that is what the

currently in the united states nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our nations electrical supply and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbonfree power source in the country however our current nuclear fleet is growing older many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older there have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs however these efforts have had mixed results there have been construction difficulties regulatory hurdles and financing issues all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in america some of these hurdles though are unlikely to go away with our current technologies the three mile island chernobyl and fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible this has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants i think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies the department of energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants h r 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market i also want to highlight one additional reason to support h r 4084 as the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future as evidenced by the paris climate agreement it presents an opportunity to american industry to supply lowcarbon power platforms like nuclear power this bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology and it is my hope it will empower american industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the entire world i would like to thank congressman weber for

this i hope you have the same passion for those at the epa who knew of flint and stayed silent who did not warn those of the water that had been poisoned the gentleman talks very boldly about wanting things done but we should talk about what has happened as we speak today we just had a hearing on flint michigan where you had gina mccarthy in you had the governor of michigan in secondly the gentleman knows that when it comes to zika we had a meeting together where we pulled in all those in government who are dealing with this issue and they will tell you there is no short answer for it they will tell you the mosquito is not as easy as just spraying and they will tell you each and every day they are learning something more the white house did not send us a supplemental until just a few weeks ago we have done nothing but move even faster there is no agencyfrom the nih or the cdclacking in money to be acting today and they will answer that question for you they have money to go forward and do the work that they need to do and that we believe needs to happen we can argue later about where that money comes from but in no way have we stopped or slowed down we have actually been

all the committee members in with the secretary and directors so in no way do i want the american public to think for one moment that we are not doing the work now there is not one easy answer for it

do not require the unitedstates to dismantle any nuclear warheads in the fy16 budget request nnsa detailed its plan to focus the next 5 years of dismantlement work on warheads retired prior to 2009 section 3121 provides them enough money to do so and it does not restrict this work on pre2009 warheads section 3121 allows the administration to carry out the dismantlement plan it described in the fy16 budget request it simply prevents the unilateral disarmament and acceleration proposed by secretary kerry which is a misguided attempt to appease those who would disarm the united states section 3121 also prohibits dismantlement of certain unitedstates nuclear cruise missile warheads for 5 years this is a prudent measure because russia is in plain violation of the inf treaty through its

"i want to take a little time this evening to take a different look at american energy as many of you know one of my core convictions is the importance of upholding the dignity of human life our task here in washington should be to promote ideas and policies that allow people to live longer healthier and more rewarding lives it is in that spirit that i have joined with my fellow pennsylvanian representative kelly and likeminded colleagues to host tonights special order starting last week world elites gathered in paris to negotiate climate change commitments and promises that if enacted could undo generations of human progress progress that has provided us with the affordable and reliable energy necessary for humans to truly flourish i am here tonight to tell another side of the story one that abandons the dogma of scarcity put forward by elites in paris and climate change zealots in washington i want to shift this debate to focus on the remarkable story of human abundance affordable reliable energy has been responsible for helping to improve and prolong the lives of billions of people around the world energy powers our businesses it keeps the lights on in our homes it allows us to have fresh food and clean water it powers our schools and our hospitals energy is in many respects a life or death matter it is a moral issue and it deserves more careful consideration than it has been given by the president i would like to highlight a little bit just taking a look at some charts in taking a look at what has been happening with the use of energy a lot of the energy we get is carbonbased fossil fuel energy whether it is coal oil natural gas yes it has increased in recent history what also has happened in recent history as c02 emissions have gone up so has the wealth of this world and of this country as the population has gone up so has energy use what is really striking is taking a look at how the increase in life expectancy has coincided with this energy revolution as well as you can see for much of human history our lives were short miserable and lacking in fulfillment consider that until the industrial revolution people lived 27 years on average earned little money and faced limited opportunities again though c02 has increased so has incredible wealth lifting billions of people out of poverty and life expectancy the point now is in the united states the average life expectancy is near 80 years old as people learned to access the bounty of energy available we turned it to our advantage as we got better at it incomes and populations soared this is another interesting chart as we look at the use of world energy just going back over the last 30 years the bottom line is energy use the top line is the world gdp the increase in wealth that we have seen coinciding with this increase in energy you could take a look at some specific countries and see how energy has benefited them in china and india both of which have industrialized and increased energy use over the last generation life expectancy has increased by more than a decade infant mortality has plummeted by 70 and 58 percent respectively in china and india this is all correlated with increased energy use and the availability of affordable energy resources as alex epstein argues in the moral case for fossil fuels hundreds of millions of people have gotten their first light bulb their first refrigerator their first decentpaying job with all of our world problems affordable energy has helped make this the brightest most abundant time in human history some disparage the story as one of unseemly consumption and excess i see it as a tremendous triumph of human ingenuity and a victory for those who put human wellbeing as our top priority we can tell the same story about western pennsylvania where once again we are witnessing increasing prosperity attracted by affordable and reliable energy this entails better opportunities for pennsylvanias youth and a better quality of life that is why i am so troubled by the presidents actions at home and in paris in negotiating a global compact which will likely entail further restrictions on our access to energy the president is unknowingly endangering our future wellbeing by not taking his plans to congress for approval as should be the case with a treaty the president is ignoring the will of the american people this is not a trivial point the american people will be denied the opportunity to weigh in on something that will drastically impact their daily lives remember the president said when he was a candidate in 2008 that electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket under his plan all of this comes in addition to heavy burdens that the american people are already grappling with the socalled clean power plan is an example by forcing more power plant closures and placing stricter requirements on those that remain the presidents plan will raise energy prices by 289 billion through 2030 hurting american families and businesses large and small research suggests that we will see 224 000 fewer american jobs being created each year because of this rule we will also see reduced disposable income and weaker economic growth minority communities will be especially hardhit a study from the national black chamber of commerce found that the clean power plan would increase poverty among african americans by 23 percent and hispanics by 26 percent this is unacceptable and it is immoral real people will be hurt by these actions yet few in washington seem to be caring about these real human costs that is why i have introduced a bill called the fair burdens act this bill would prevent the burden from endangering our prosperity and wellbeing until the epa can verify that a sufficient number of countries have enacted similarly stringent policies in other words the fair burdens act would ensure that americans arent made to needlessly suffer and that our jobs arent forced overseas as the president unilaterally slows the american economy we cant just rely on legislation we need to change the narrative and educate the public affordable reliable energy is a vital ingredient for human prosperity and wellbeing ignoring this fact and taking illconceived policy actions as a result condemns millions of americans and billions around the world to dimmer futures
