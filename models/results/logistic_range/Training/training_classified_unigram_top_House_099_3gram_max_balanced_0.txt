the gentleman from michigan my friend and colleague and the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from ohio for introducing this legislation providing for appropriate recognition of the enormous contribution that the trio programs have made to improving educational opportunity in this nation adoption of this resolution is especially timely as congress and the nation attempt to grapple with the effects of the grammrudman balanced budget legislation the trio programs which are formally called the special programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds are authorized under the higher education act of 1965 they serve as a vital part of the federal strategy to assure equal educational opportunity in postsecondary education it is presently estimated that over 38 400 students will be eliminated from the trio programs in fiscal year 1986 and that an additional 123 400 students will be dropped in fiscal year 1987 if congress does not act and the grammrudman sequestration order becomes effective while everyone of us must look for ways to cut the fat from even our most popular federal programs i contend that our education programs programs which allow our most disadvantaged citizens to compete on an equal footing with other more fortunate students must be afforded special attention continuing our strong support for education both at the secondary and postsecondary levels is clearly one of the most costeffective policies that this congress can engage in adoption of this resolution is a strong message from those of us who support a strong federal role in education that the fight has not yet begun since the adoption of the grammrudman legislation late last session and the subsequent presentation of the presidents fiscal year 1987 budget proposal i have been visited by representatives from all segments of the education communityschool teachers university and college presidents trustees teachers and studentsall of whom are deeply and rightfully concerned about the future of education in america by observing national trio day we will draw attention to the erosion of our postsecondary education programs and the tremendous risk that we as a nation place ourselves in should we perpetrate a system of education available only to those who can afford it the 1 280 programs presently funded under trio operate in over 800 colleges and universities and over 800 community agencies currently more than 460 000 disadvantaged youth and adults receive couniseling basic skills instruction tutoring and information about college admissions and financial aid from these projects two thirds of the students served by trio come from families whose income is below 150 percent of the poverty level and where neither parent has graduated from college accordingly i urge my colleagues to offer their support to house concurrent resolution 278 designating february 28 1986 as national trio day"], [2.6732683181762695e-05, 0.49997326731681824, 0,

state law or ordinance if any one state if every state wished to ban interstate sale of handguns within their borders all they have to do is pass a law that says no one but a resident of x state can buy a handgun in x state that stops it and this pro ision in our bill does not abrogate that in any way i would also like to point out that back in 1982 ferris lucas who was speaking in behalf of the national sheriffs association before the senate judiciary committee said the entire existing federal gun law makes it a felony for a private citizen and they still do to give or sell a firearm to a resident of a different state even though this would violate the laws of neither state and the present law does that even though you may not violate the laws of either state you still violate the federal law if my brother who lives in the state of washington was to come to visit me and he would like to acquire a handgun and is qualified in both statesby the way he just retired from the federal bureau of corrections so i do not think he is a crook in any way he is a lawabiding citizen in every respecthe could not purchase that handgun in the state of missouri even though he qualified both in the state of washington and in the state of missouri and you would make it difficult all you are trying to do is make it more difficult for that private citizen to acquire that handgun you are not

think a substantial achievement to reduce spending levels under 1985 and certainly is going in the right direction on the interior section i would point out that the house prevailed in the sense that on the cleancoal provision we have provided for a 400 million 3year program to develop cleancoal technologies in the original bill the house supported this by a vote of 3 to 1 so we are pleased that we could retain it i think it is a good provision coal is the greatest energy resource this nation has under this provision those that want to participate with the federal government in programs have to put up a 50percent match that means that of course they will have to commit a lot of their own resources to address this problem but it will help us in burning coal to avoid the acid rain problem that confronts many areas of the country and confronts our relationship with canada i think that is a very important element in the bill many will be thankful in the years to come that we have taken
