government in 1979 the overthrow of president somoza was broadbased popular it had the support of labor business professional groups and the church and most segments of nicaraguan society the oas passed a resolution of support for the revolution and this was extraordinary it was extraordinary because they supported the overthrow of one of its members but a condition of the overthrow by oas was requiring a democratic pluralist and nonaligned nicaragua these conditions were accepted by the sandinistas in a cable on july 12 1979 now after that we had an acrimonious debate in the house of representatives and i remember it vividly the gentleman from florida mr dante fascell the chairman of the foreign affairs committee who spoke so eloquently a few minutes ago talked about the gentleman leading the battle to get the money for the sandinistas i remember being convinced that even though i did not think the communists were going to change their minds i remember people saying youve got hard line communists youve got people who have got money from outside the country coming into the country and youre not going to do anything at all by giving them money but i voted for the money because i felt it was the right thing to do and it was about the same amount of money we are talking about today we offered to send peace corp volunteers into nicaragua and instead what they acceptedwere military advisers and economic advisers from cuba they did not accept any aid from the united states and the repression that was so prevalent under the somoza regime was back under the communist regime that is now ruling as i said the amount of aid t hat we gave to the sandinistas at thattime was about the same amount of aid that we are talking about today now the carter administration had to withdraw that aid because they violated the very agreement that they made the sandinistas violated the agreements that they mjade as a matter of fact during that period of time the costa rican national assembly investigators estimated that at least 1 million pounds of material entered nicaragua from cuba in the 6 to 8 weeks before the somoza government was overthrown so they established very clearly the link between cuba and the nicaraguan government which took over now going down to the philippines not long ago i saw what the church can do when it supports a free election what international observers can do the thing that nicaragua worries about the most are free elections you saw the farce that they called a free election not long ago you know that if there is a free election in nicaragua what will happen you know very well even though you see on tv the people say well i support the government well if i lived in nicaragua i would say i support the government also because obviously it is not to the benefit of the people to not support the government on tv but i remember vividly going to el salvador as an observer to the elections the press reported there would be a very low turnout and it would be a free election many people here were criticizing us for giving aid to the el salvador government and that the guerrillas were inside guerrillas not being directed from the outside and the people would not vote and would not support an election i remember flying out over on election day and seeing the long lines of people and talking to some of the people who were voting standing in those lines for hours and saying to us after being threatened by the guerrillas and walking for miles they can kill me they can kill my family but they cant kill us all they were threatened with cutting their fingers off because they were going to vote and when they make a threat in el salvador it is a serious threat there is no question about it because of the violence that goes on in that country but they ighored that and 80 percent of the people in el salvador voted and you saw the turnout and they have i freely elected government and even though we got all kinds of criticism in the united states for giving them aid they had another election they elected a freely elected government and they are doing well some of the very same people who criticized what we are doing in el salvador now try to take credit for the legislation that we passed a couple years ago so if in this country can give aid to places like the philippines which is 8 500 miles away zaire 4 million 6 500 miles malaysia 9 000 miles away gabon oman portugal thousands of miles away hundreds of millions of dollars to countries that are so far away it seems to me that there can be bipartisan support for a compromise which has been worked out so that we can send a message to them that they should have free elections and the people of nicaragua can select a majority party in that country to run that country and get rid of the repressive regime which is in nicaragua today i just want to say this in my feeling there is no way we are going to have a chance in government down there unless the united states has military aid in order to stimulate a change in that government there is no way the other democracies will survive unless the united states supports what is going on down there so i very strongly urge this house to support the aid recommended by the president under the compromise position under the skeleton plan"], [0.9500146508216858,
