designation as proposed by the secretary takes effect aut omatically noaa in its designation document for the cordell banks national marine sanctuary has proposed to prohibit oil and gas activities

secretary to ensure protection of the cordell banks conservation recreational ecological historical research educational and aesthetic values noaa has already stated its intention to continue its rulemaking process after the sanctuary designation legally takes place to ban all oil and gas activities within the entire 400squaremile sanctuary noaa has not at this point proposed this comprehensive ban in the designation document it recently issued citing legal and administrative requirements to issue a more comprehensive supplemental environmental impact statement before doing so house joint resolution 281 uses the statutory congressional review process to make this proposed regulatory change for noaa thus avoiding the need for the supplemental environmental impact statement and the delay and cost associated with preparing such a study since noaa has already proposed this more comprehensive ban on oil and gas activities within the entire national marine sanctuary i believe mr boscos bill house joint resolution 281 is within the proper congressional review procedure as we envisioned it in 1984 during the amendment to title iii of the marine protection research and sanctuaries act however i am concerned that opponents of the ocs oil and gas program will begin to view the national marine sanctuary program as a convenient and effective tool to block ocs leasing in potential future sanctuary areas or designated sites the program is not designed for such a purpose and to do so would be an abuse of the sanctuary law the statute specifically allows for activities such as ocs operations to be regulated and permitted so long as the purpose of the sanctuary is compatible with such activities and indeed no such ban of oil and gas activities exists for the majority of national marine sanctuaries already designated and in existence today i am also somewhat concerned with the precedent regarding the provision chairman jones added to the hill during committee consideration to require an environmental imact state ment for exploration activities off tie coast of north carolina the outer continental shelf lands act clearly does not envision the need for an environmental impact statement at the exploration stage environmental impact statements are required prior to lease sales earlier in the process courts have ruled to this effect and my concern is that this provision may be viewed as a precedent which could further harm the ocs program a program which is vital to the national energy security of this nation and which has repeatedly come under unwarranted attacks by its opponents i know that chairman jones has been a supporter of this program in the past and has worked diligently to avoid congressional appropriations moratoria which have undermined this program it is my understanding that negotiations are underway between the minerals management service at the interior department and the state of north carolina and that some accommodations may be made to alleviate the states concerns while i do have concerns about the precedent of this provision i do support the chairmans efforts to alleviate his states concerns in this

for what it says as for what it does i would like to just share a few thoughts with members about it clearly the gentleman from florida mr bemnri and i are trying to restore some dollars to provide for funding in the conventional arena we are preoccupied today and tomorrow with very very expensive hightechnology very sophisticated complex equipment and the procurement of that equip ment the gentleman from florida and i feel that during the defense debate over the past 3 or 4 years we have truly lost sight of what should be an equally important priority and that is our conventional fighting capability one of the four items contained in the bennett amendment and one of the four items that we are trying to restore ladies and gentlemen is basic ammunition we will talk about 3 billion or 4 billion for sdi and we are going to talk about 500 million for each stealth bomber but while these debates have been going on the past couple of years we have seen a depletion of our ammunition stores in nato so what the gentleman from florida is trying to do is bring us back to earth to think about our conventional capability ultimately the soldier in any kind of conflict must take and retain ground it is the toughest physical and psychological warfighting mission if you are engaged in combat your ultimate mission is to take and retain ground we can talk about sdi and we can talk about stealth bombers and we can talk about a lot of other expensive strategic and nuclear systems but we also better start talking about readiness we had better start talking about sustainability we had better start talking about what kind of equipment we give to those men who are conventional fighters who have the toughest the most important mission in the department of defense one of my personal frustrations throughout the defense debate over the past 3 or 4 years has been the absence of any interest in this body to provide our infantry with an effective light antitank weapon a light shoulderheld antitank weapon that is not real sexy not too many headlines are written for those with an interest in conventional armaments next to his m16 or whatever rifle he may employ the antitank weapon is the most important piece of equipment an infantry soldier can carry a few of us have tried for 3 years to convince them to have a test of the six or seven available antitank weapons in the world today we want them to be tested under realistic live fire conditions and then we want the best one purchased and delivered to our soldiers i would just congratulate the gentleman from florida for elevating in this very small but significant way the whole question of conventional capability and urge my colleagues to support this amendment"], [0.0006820857524871826,

important decision obviously regarding this base at least the commission has not done the job we charged them with doing and we ought to reject it i know the difficulty of that the vast majority of the members of the house of representatives are not affected by the base closure commissions work the full gao report is not ready so we cannot have an independent and definite appraisal regarding the entire work product of the commission that would show the congress that they have not done overall the job that we charged them with doing at the bottom line the house ought to look at the record that we have and understand that there is before us a substantial body of information that leads us to the conclusion that the commission acted improperly outside the scope of the law which created them and certainly not in a way that we can point to with pride and say that this work was done intelligently fairly and honestly for those reasons i recommend to the house that they reject the commissions work support the resolution of disapproval and send them back to the drawing board to do the work that we required them to do and to do it in an honest fair and unbiased manner"],
