that in perspective by first of all thanking you for your indulgence during that period of time when words got a little heated and things got a little sticky at times we appreciate the work that the chair did during that period of time and we thank you for putting up with what was sometimes a tough situation but it seems to me that it is important to understand that we opened up this legislative session by trying to point out that there is a problem in this house of representatives the problem is that the majority party the liberals in this body who talk so much about fairness but who are perfectly willing to use rules and laws to trample the minority do not play by the rules when the rules are used in a way which they do not agree with they simply ignore the rules and go on that is not only unfair it is downright dictatorial that was a part of a number of things that were done on this house floor today first of all it was raised by the majority leader that we should dispense with calendar wednesday that request was objected to why was it objected to because calendar wednesday is a means by which we can get around the scheduling that takes place by the majority leadership in the last several weeks of the previous session what we found was that the majority leadership was perfectly willing to use the schedule of the house for its own purposes so one of the things that we have had to decide is that we will not permit that to go on without some sort of counterforce and that counterforce can be the calendar wednesday rule that would at least allow legislation to come to the floor through some other means than the schedule put forth by the majority leadership that may not produce everything that we want but it will assure that a broader base of legislation will come before this house and that the individual members of this house will have more say in what it is that is considered that is the kind of democracy that this house of representatives is supposed to be it is the kind of democracy that we ought to be pursuing not abandoning through unanimous consent requests every week later on a number of us asked unanimous consent to bring to the floor some pieces of legislation that have languished in house committees for literally years i personally asked that we bring to the floor the school prayer amendment why did i do that that is an amendment that has been around for almost 20 years the american people have for that whole period over 20 years supported that amendment by overwhelming numbers the polling data shows 80 percent of the people on an average support the idea of allowing a constitutional amendment that would allow voluntary prayer in the public schools yet in that 20year period we have not been able to get the vote on this house floor for something that the american people are overwhelmingly in favor of why because in the unfair committee structure that we discussed at some length earlier on they do not permit that kind of legislation to come to the floor what happened well the request that we made was a far fairer request than that which brought the equal rights amendment to the floor just the other day the request that i made was for an open rule that would allow for consideration of that amendment an open rule meaning that we would have been allowed to debated amendments and we would have been allowed full debate of the issue the other day when the majority leadership scheduled a constitutional amendment on the floor they did it under a gag rule that allowed no amendments and 30 minutes of debate so what we were proposing was a far fairer procedure than that which the majority party has used within the last few weeks to bring a constitulonal amendment to the floor what happened well the gentleman from texas turned down our ability to consider that issue he singly decided that this house should not consider prayer we have some other requests that we said the house ought to consider first a balanced budget amendment that also was turned down we say now that we ought to consider line item vetoes since the grace commission recently recommended that as a way to get a handle on 200 billionayear deficits that was turned down we said that on this day when there are thousands of americans in washington d c standing up for the rights of the unborn that amendment ought to come out here to at least be voted on that too was turned down all of those amendment were to be brought out here under a procedure much fairer than the procedure that was used for the equal rights amendment just a few weeks ago but they were turned down it is unfair it is dictatorial so what we then said was that we needed to have some time some time over the next several weeks to discuss some of these matters to have some time of our own since we do not get the time from the democrats since they will not allow those issues to come out here on this floor to be discussed then we ought to have some time of our own to discuss those issues and to let the american people know exactly what is going on in this body so i requested time time for each of the days that we are to be in session in this legislative year i requested 4 hours of time to have some debate controlled by the minority and what happened on that well once again the dictatorship of the majority came down hard once again they said flatly no they said even though you are within the rules even though the rules clearly allow you to take that time we are not going to permit it there is no way we are going to allow you to schedule that kind of debate and allow the minority to make its case to the american people this is the party of fairness now we are talking about the party that says they stand up for minority rights the party that says that they believe in open discussion and open debate that is what they say but their actions do not prove it and i would say to the members that rev jesse jackson who was making some comments about what is going on in the democratic convention has a point because they have been practicing exactly those kinds of tactics right here on the house floor for years jesse jackson has found the convention unfair and i am sure it is i am sure the rules there have been stacked for the good old boy i just like the rules around here are stacked for the good old boys to make sure that the candidate selected is not really a free choice but is mandated by the procedures it is appalling what happened when lie took his case to the executive committee the other day well they ran him out they said there is no way they are going to consider changing their rules so much for that minority participation in the democratic convention so much for minority participation here on the house floor i think the amf ican people need to understand and they need to become concerned about the fact that their house has become a virtual dictatorship in which you had better go along or you dont get along in which you had better sit back and accept your fate or they will use their rules to roll over you like a steamroller that is a sad commentary it is not unprecedented however this house has had dictatorships of the majority in the past there have been other times when the rules have become a cover for outright dictatorship and the house has seen fit to move toward reforming itself and changing that status quo it appears to me as though it is time for a change now and i for one and i think a number of my colleagues are committed to trying to bring about some of those changes over the next several weeks i think it is important that the american people once again have a body in congress where they truly have a say where there is fairness where equal voices are heard so that the nations business can be articulated in a way which reflects the peoples will that is not the case here this has become a body of the elite that elitism is trqmpling democracy and must be stopped"],

to house concurrent resolution 113 five months ago the house overwhelmingly defeated a proposal for funding the mx mis sile because no secure basing mode was available we were told then that the mx could not be placed in existing silos because it would be vulnerable we were told that the mx was critical for our defense because only the mx could help close the window of vulnerability we were told and we all agree that the unitedstates nuclear arsenal required a weapon that could survive a first strike because that was necessary to deter war we have now received a report which urges us to base the mx in existing silos which are already targeted by the soviet union under close scrutiny the window of vulnerability has disappeared and deterrence is being promised with a basing mode that would invite a first strike by the other side we have been encouraged by some who suggest that because we will require a reduced number of missiles we are saving 10 billion i contend that if this dangerously destabilizing scheme were free it would still cost too much it would cost too much because we will not use it in a first strike and we cannot use it for measured retaliation its vulnerability requires that we launch it within the 30 minutes when an attack is first detected and the first enemy missiles land when the russians see it coming do we really expect them to leave their missiles in hardened sites awaiting the arrival of the mx i listen to the argument that to build the mx and place it in vulnerable silos is a demonstration of our national will and find it lacking our national will is amply demonstrated by our willingness to spend billions of dollars on submarine based ballistic missiles cruise missiles and conventional weapons our national will is demonstrated by our eagerness to end the madness of another round in the arms race and to seek a reasonable negotiation for the reduction of nuclear weapons surely the russians are as perplexed as our european allies at an expression of national will that would lead us to base mx in vulnerable silos the destabilizing nature of a weapon that can only rationally be used for a first strike does not reflect our national willit reflects another step in the direction of disaster the concept of deterrence requires that our adversaries realize that to start a nuclear war will result in unacceptable losses to them of the 9 000 nuclear warheads that the united states now has deployed fewer than 5 percent need be available to retaliate in order to bring about the devastation of the russian industrial capacity indeed their civilization beyond reasonable hope of recovery if this is insufficient to deter our adversaries then surely the addition of 700 nuclear warheads to our already numerically superior arsenal will not increase its power to deter it is time we take stock of our national defense needs rather than attempt to match the strategy tactics and weapons we ascribe to the other side the arguments against the mx are myriad it serves no deterrent function it is vulnerable it is a highly valued target it is expensive and unproven and it has no value other than to blast hardened targets which will surely be empty by the time it arrives the arguments in favor of placing the mx in existing silos are specious it cannot function as a bargaining chip unless both sides are willing to bargain it is not a demonstration of national will but rather a demonstration of a willingness to build the next generation of missiles without regard for its intended purpose its usefulness or its role in the overall scheme of defending our nation we have given the basing of the mx a hearing and it has come up wanting i call on my fellow members of congress to vote down this illconsidered scheme of placing a threatening weapon in a vulnerable position it is time that we consider carefully tpe overall integration of our next generation of land based missiles in the context of our defensive needs during the decades to come what will we need to complement the planned trident submarines the cruise missiles and the stealth bomber what share of the nuclear burden are our

remain silent because on almost everything we have tried to do in improving this bill has been misinterpreted by someone when it first started in the subcommittee on energy and commerce we voted to allow a bill out that was terribly defective in the tax structure only because we thought we would have a chance to clean it up in the full committee markup when we go to the full committee markup on energy and commerce we were met with an objection procedurally to any amendments on the tax issue on title v we were told by the chairman well dont worry ill go to the rules committee and get permission from the rules committee that you can offer amendments on the floor on the tax side of this bill this is a major tax increase for america i support expansion and extension of the superfund bill but i want to do it in a responsible manner the rules committee has not given us a chance to do that the rules committee denied the request of the energy and commerce committee to let this house consider amendments that the energy and commerce committee recommended unanimously amendments for example to remove from the taxing portion of the bill all those elements of metals that indeed are nontoxic and to submit in place of them the toxic compounds now somewhere along the line aluminum got out it is a nontoxic metal copper got back in it is a nontoxic metal somewhere along the line zinc

metal no attempt has been made by the rules committee to give this house a chance to lend order to this bill when it comes to taxing metals worst of all this member offered in the energy and commerce committee an amendment that would provide a similar tax on imported petrochemicals a tax on chemicals coming into this country that falls just as surely into the waste stream and does just as much damage to our environment as domestically produced chemicals a similar tax to make sure that petrochemical refiners and petrochemical companies do not relocate outside this country and we lose the jobs that that relocation would cause to make sure the tax fell evenly on imports and domestically produce i products to make sure american jobs were protected to make sure that companies would not avoid the superfund tax by going offshore and to stop the hbrrible influx of imported chemicals into this country in the first quarter of this year imported petrochemicals tripled imports a threefold increase in the first quarter indicating a worldwide attempt to take over our markets a simple amendment to equalize the tax and the rules committee turned it down the rules committee could have given

and the administration of justice for their work on h r 4145 the state justice institute act in assessing the need for this legislation i think it is important to keep in mind that our system of justice is indivisible in that state courts share with federal courts the responsibility for enforcing the rights and duties of the constitution and laws of the united states in fact over 96 percent of all the cases tried in the united states are handled by the state courts many of these cases are the result of federal policies and decisions i think it is clear that the federal government has a legitimate interest in strengthening and improving the state courts during the debate on legislation to abolish diversity opponents often argued that it was necessary to preserve diversity because the state courts were inadequate forums for such cases regardless of whether or not one accepts the validity of that argument the state justice institute by providing financial and technical assistance to the state courts has the potential for making it feasible to return diversity cases to them this would result in a significant reduction in the workload of the federal courts and a substantial reduction in the expenditure required for their operation as the chief justice of the united states has noted we must avoid any situation in which federal courts are pressured to become a refuge for citizens who seek a federal forum not because their claim is of a truly federal nature but because state courts are inadequate should our people ever lose onfidence in their state courts not only will our federal courts become more and more overburdened but a pervasive lack of confidence in all courts will develop last congress the department of justice testified before the courts subcommittee that they supported the concept of a state justice institute but were opposed to the legislation for budgetary reasons however at the end of the last congress the department of justice indicated that they

opposed to the bill on the basis that it addresses problems that are more appropriately addressed by the states and which are not the responsibility of the federal government it is important to note

authorization bill i do so reluctantly in three terms in the house i have never before voted against either a defense authorizations bill or a defense appropriations bill there have been many occasions in the past when defense bills included funding for weapons systems i did not support indeed this bill contains funding for the blb bomber and the mx missile both of which systems i have opposed as wasteful uses of defense dollars but never before have i voted against an entire bill in voting against this conference report i am not voting to defeat it with the intention of achieving widespread changes my vote instead is aimed at achieving the elimination of funds for one purposethe production of chemical nerve gas i have voted repeatedly with a majority of this bodymost recently a majority of 95 votesto cancel production of chemical nerve gas weapons my view and that of a strong majority of this body has been that those weapons are unnecessary for our national security and represent a dangerous escalation of a new arms race with the soviets furthermore these weapons would have to be deployed in europe and our european allies have expressed opposition to their deployment the decision of the conferees to provide funding for production of nerve gas would be understandable even given the house vote on the issue if the senate had taken a strong position in support of chemical weapons but the senate vote on the question was a 49 to 49 tie which was broken by vice president bush clearly there is no strong support in either body for this program to go forward finally let me deal with one argument that has been made by those who support this conference report the argument is that in the wake of the soviets brutal action in shooting down the korean airliner it is important that we send a signal to the soviets to showv our resolve to maintain a strong defense let mue just say that the soviets are not likely to be impressed by the house of representatives voting to waste money on an unnecessary weapons system that our allies oppose the issue here is not how to deal with the reprehensible actions taken by the soviets in the matter of the korean airliner the issue is how best to provide for this nations defense and how to spend out defense dollars on the most effective weapons systems we can production of nerve gas is not in this nations best interest

several angles first of all if you establish a reserve to be there to help for a world food problem then i would be greatly concerned that we raid that reserve for other purposes and particularly get concerned at this time of low wheat prices that we would not go out and buy wheat that we need for these other purposes the second problem that i have is that very possibly what we are doing is taking this from the reserve at a time of low prices we will have to come back when prices are higher to replenish it which is certainly not advisable for the taxpayers of the country third from the point of view of farmers if this reserve is not set aside separately and it can be used for domestic purposes then i think we lose a large part of the purpose of the reserve as insulating farmers i support the legislation but i would hope it will be clear that it will not be used for other purposes although i support h r 1590 as a necessary and timely response to the nutrition needs of those not touched by economic recovery i am concerned by that provision in the bill authorizing the secretary of agriculture to tap the emergency food security reserve in order to provide wheat to the needy nevertheless i recognize that this provision is required if we realistically hope to get this food program off the ground this year however my concern about drawing from the reserve at this time stems from the distributing precedent that we are setting by this action first i am troubled by the fact that we are drawing down an emergency food reserve during a period marked by record wheat production and a record wheat surplus the conventional wisdom since biblical times has been that you add to your emergency reserves during times of plenty and draw from these stocks during periods of famine the provision for tapping the reserve included in h r 1590 wwch will also mandate replenishing the reserve laterpossibly during a period of widespread shortage and higher pricesstands this logic on its head second i would have preferred to see a supplemental appropriation request for this year which would have allowed the secretary of agriculture to go into the open market to purchase wheat directly from farmers farmers hold almost all of the wheat surplus right now and they are sill plagued by low prices for this commodity open market purchases would have provided the wheat required for humanitarian assistance in our country while providing higher prices for farmers third farmers agreed to support the creation of the emergency food reserve largely because of the promise made to them that it would not be used in any way to provide wheat to the domestic market i believe that many farmers will view our action today as breaking faith with that commitment and this could frustrate our future attempts to maintain this type of reserve finally i would hope that our approving a new use for this reserve will not give rise to demands for tapping the reserve to fulfill other needs such as supplying wheat for the domestic pik program or an export pik effort i am pleased that the gentleman from south dakota has clarifled the administrations firm opposition to tapping the reserve for anything other than its originally intended purpose and i also appreciate the assurances from the sponsors of this bill that they will oppose any efforts to authorize still other uses for the

with a modest amount of authorizing language that is not true our rules contemplate the kind of situation we are facing and they specifically authorize the continuing resolution to have authorizing language without a waiver from the committee on rules so what the appropriations committee has done is not something extraordinary but something that our rules specifically contemplate while there may have been occasions in the past where very shortrun continuing resolutions have not had such authorizations we should understand this is a continuing resolution which contemplates what i hope will be the case that we will not have a lameduck session after the election and that therefore this is going to be our last chance until a new congress comes and organizes itself next january so this is

program the limits are 15 000 for businesses 10 000 for households this program is one thing that has done a great deal to stabilize neighborhoods if you have a little businessman unable to get crime insurance in marginal neighborhoods you are going to see abandonments rapidly because they cannot afford to stay there once they cannot get crime insurance so this is very important not just for people in this house who have public works projects but if you have small businessmen and householders who are dependent on this crime insurance program if you have some knarginal neighborhoods in

involved but i think that we should not lose sight of the basics here i am talking about the human elementthe farmers and ranchers and their families who would be harmed if the congress passed this legislation i want to first make clear that my opposition is not based upon any particular objections to the coal slurry concept itself instead my opposition is based upon three very specific concerns i have about the damage this legislation could cause to individuals and the national welfare i would like to briefly outline my concerns first i am deeply disturbed about the inadequacy of water protection provisions in this bill the coal slurry bill reported by the public works and interior committees simply fails to offer protection to those water resources shared between states the amended coal pipeline bill protects only the interests of the state which desires to divert and sell valuable water for use in coal slurry pipelines vitally important rights in shared interstate waters of downstream and adjacent states such as iowa are left unprotected in an effort to provide this badly needed protection i together m~rth messrs hammerscimidt vento edgar leviras bereuter and others will offer an amendment to h r 3849 to require the drainage basin states to formulate an agreement to govern a water transfer before any state can sell transfer or permit the sale or transfer of shared water it seems to me that encouraging participation by individual states in such a compact is a reasonable and prudent safeguard it is clear that largescale bidding wars between differing interests for finite water from states willing to market it could take place in tile near future with the fiscal strain many of our states are experiencing the temptation to raise revenue through tilis sort of sale may prove to be irresistible we must not allow it to happen furthermore agriculture when pitted against better organized and well financed water users stands only to lose i must emphasize that these threats arevery real and present in the midst of a catastrophic droughtone which has literally devastated our farmersit is inconceivable that congress would act foolishly to waste a resource as scarce and valuable as water tile water prices to our farmers and ranchers would only be driven out of sight if we allow ihr 3849 to pass and force them to complete with large pipeline companies can any member of tis body look at the destruction inflicted on farm families by the drought of 1983 and fail to see the added harm this bill could inflict tile second major concern i have withl h r 3849 is the provision which permit coal slurry pipelines to exercise the power of fedeal eminent domain if this pipeline bill is allowed to become law the congress would be granting the awesome power of federal eminent domain to a small number of private interests pipeline companies have been repeatedly denied eminent domain by the states how can congress then in good conscience extend federal eminent domain authority to coal slurry pipelines trampling the rights of our states to judge what is in the best interest of our citizens this leads me to my third and the most basic problem with the legislation before us today i mentioned earlier my concern over the bills effect on the people in our districts and across the nation as i said with all the complexities of this legislation we must not lose sight of the human element at stake here in june the agriculture subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development held a hearing on legislation i introduced h r 1749 regarding the sale by one state of water resources shared with other states to coal pipeline companies keeping in mind that the coal slurry pipellneswould be routed across the land of our farmers and ranchers let me just tell you how the power of eminent domain has affected four south dakota ranchers who came to washington and appeared before the subcommittee their experience may be shared by many others if this legislation is enacted into law these ranchers told a shocking story of their experiences with intimidation and threats by the energy transportalion system inc etsi pipeline company which is seeking land to construct a coal pipeline they told of their struggles to protect their lands from the powerful etsi pipellne company while i will not go into detail about the plight of these ranchers i will tell you their story was an eyeopener they were told in effect that it did not mater to the pipcline company that the path it chose for its pipeline was almost impassable and ecologically and financially unsound the pipeline company wanted each ranchers land and they were told to take it or leave it and if they did not like the contract the landowners only remedy was to take the pipeline company to court i do not think this body wants that kind of story repeated in other states and other communities certainly it is too much to expect that farmers and ranchers can absorb the legal costs necessary to challenge these energy companies if the house passes h r 3849 congress will give these coal pipeline companies federal rights of eminent domain so they can force the sale of the property the pipeline company needs for its pipeline to a big pipeline company taking some farmer or ranchers land tinder eminent domain it is just another number in the companys ledger book but for the small landowner or farmer in the path of the pipeline it may be economic life or death in conclusion this bill is unfair in humian terms and unwise in terms of good water policy i urge its defeat and i urge my colleagues to think hard about these concerns"]]}
