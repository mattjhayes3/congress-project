and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance

sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in

united states trade deficits have soared japan has come in for increasing criticism from the united states for their part the japanese feel that they are being made the scapegoat for americas declining international competitiveness and to a certain extent they are right it is painful for americansand particularly american politiciansto concede that most of our competitiveness problems are made in america nevertheless much of the criticism of japan is valid particularly the notion that it has been unwilling to accept responsibilities commensurate with their surging international economic power and status for example in recent years the japanese have refused to increase their imports from third world countries thereby exerting additional pressure on american markets to help developing countries generate enough export earnings to service their massive debt burden in this way the third world debt crisis has exacerbated americas underlying trade problems for this reason i was particularly pleased to read today of a new initiative announced by the former japanese foreign minister shintaro abe who said japan plans to lend up to 30 billion over the next few years to latin american debtor countries next week when the trade bill is debated on the house floor japan will be roundly criticized on a bipartisan basis but today i want to acknowledge this positive step by the japanese and give credit where it is due indeed at a time when large banks all over the world are worried about a deepening of the third world debt crisis japans leading banks and their government are ready to try a novel approach to easing the crisis and simultaneously improving their international competitiveness the first step in this new approach came last month when japans 28 largest banks created a mechanism for clearing their books of nonperforming ldc sovereign loans japanese banks will be the first with substantial foreign loans to take losses on their third world portfolios now rather than postpone the day of reckoning they have established a joint factoring company that will buy the loans at a discount enabling the banks to get large tax savings from these sales the plan will give japanese banks a new competitive edge they believe the move will enable them to catch up with the tax and regulatory positions of united states and european banks unlike competitors they will no longer be tying up large amounts of capital to support frozen assets that have at best an uncertain earnings potential now with the second step announced yesterday japan has indicated their intention to help recycle their trade surpluses as growth capital for debtor countries in short this constitutes a japanese marshall plan for the third world as such this action is also a dramatic example of just how much economic power relationships in the world are changing in october 1985 secretary of the treasury baker proposed a new international lending program from industrialized countries to third world debtors calling for 20 billion from commercial banks over 3 years unfortunately it has not materialized fortunately the japanese now appear willing to unilaterally move forward with 30 billion over roughly the same time period but lets understand something else the japanese are not doing this only out of the goodness of their heartssuch action will clearly be in japans longterm selfinterest despite the fact that the japanese loans will apparently not be directly tied to the purchase of japanese goods and services you can be sure that japanese economic influence will in fact expand rapidly throughout latin america as japanese financiers negotiate their lending packages in this regard increased lending to latin america will help japan to maintain its exportoriented economy at the same time it may also reduce pressures on japan to export to the united states thereby reducing bilateral trade tensions between our two countries however even though this new japanese initiative is quite welcome it is not enough the japanese have been recycling their trade surpluses with the united states by buying united states treasury bonds and investing in american industry and real estate for the past several years but they still need to open up their markets to unitedstates exports in the same way i hope that the japanese will also begin to open up

issue that i had raised that he felt i took a bath on it i think i lost dramatically and noticing the loneliness of that position stew came over to me and befriended me and told me at that time whether or not that particular amendment wasit is long since forgottenwas meritorious or not it is something that i cannot recall but he told me you know being lonely in defeat is not without its virtue there young man and you should not forget that as i watched stew mckinney fight the lonely fights that he had fought in subsequent years based on principle always i realized how absolutely genuine his remarks were when he made them to me the friendship that we built and developed over the years is a friendship that i cannot forget i think his loss is not only my loss and a loss to his delegation but it is really a loss to this institution as i think of words to describe stew mckinney the first word that occurs to me is heart this guy had a heart he was a man who was given many

the smallness in us stew mckinney was not that way he always reached for something bigger he always tried to reach that higher level of statecraft that larger question that larger plane and he wanted the debates to be fought out on that basis the example of the public life and the private life he has given to each and every one of us is a tremendous example we do have our fights we are going to

years been the location of the worlds longest breakfast table thousands of happy battle creekers gather annually to eat together and celebrate the august institution of breakfast this is because battle creek is the home of the worlds most wonderful breakfast cereals as my noted constituent tony the tiger says theyre greeat thus you can imagine the mortification that i and all battle creekers felt on reading the news that on may 17 some 27 067 residents of springfield maa town famous for basketballbreakfasted together and ostensibly broke battle creeks breakfast record were the wire service stories correct if so what to do well michiganders are of sturdy stock we shall meet the springfield challenge on june 6 battle creekers will be getting together once again for breakfast i am confident that we shall reclaim from springfield the title that is properly ours thus i want to lay down a challenge to congressman edward boland the distinguished member who represents springfield i want to suggest that if springfield retains the record for the most people at breakfast i will personally present congressman boland with 10 boxes of the battle creek cereal of his choice but if battle creek reclaims the title he should present me with a fully inflated basketball purchased in springfield may the best town win"], [0.0010476112365722656, 0.5010476112365723, 0, "i want to express my strong support for h r 1451 the older americans act amendments of 1987 of which i am a cosponsor since its establishment in 1965 the older americans act has helped provide critical assistance needed by americas elderly citizens now more than ever as we find our elderly population growing faster than any other sector of our society the programs provided for by this landmark legislation take on even greater meaning and significance as you are well aware the authorization for programs under the older americans act will expire at the end of fiscal year 1987 in order then for continuation of these important programs the house has brought to the floor h r 1451 h r 1451 will reauthorize the existing programs under the oaa for 4 more years and authorize increases to cover inflation when congress first enacted the older americans act its initial objective was to assist the elderly in acquiring their basic needs of food and shelter since then the oaa has become the primary social services program directed toward our senior population in new jersey alone the new jersey division on aging and the respective county offices on aging receive funding which provides over 200 nutrition sites throughout the state besides both congregate meals and inhome meals programs for the elderly the act provides for multipurpose senior citizens centers homemaker services legal assistance employment opportunities aid to victims of crime and transportation beyond the status quo however h r 1451 breaks new ground by providing for among other things a new program for inhome services to the frail elderly and a 1year effort to locate povertystricken elderly and register them for important assistance programs available to them as brought to the floor the bill would also strengthen the role of local or state ombudsman projects for longterm care facility residents and directs state and area aging agencies to act as advocates on behalf of older individuals once again i wish to express in no uncertain terms my strong support for the reauthorization of the older americans act when the reauthorization issue came before congress in 1981 and again in 1984 i showed my support on the floor by voting yes for reauthorization as a cosponsor of h r 1451 i urge my colleagues to join me in approving this extremely important measure"], [0.0012370944023132324,
