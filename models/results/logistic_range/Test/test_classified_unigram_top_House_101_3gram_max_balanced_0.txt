little bit surprised not only at the fact that this is being jeopardized but at the debate this afternoon first with regard to the committee running roughshod over authorization or trying to pull off some sort of slamdunk here that is not what is happening at all the committee is simply honorong a congressional compromise that was made in 1986 all hydro projects on this little stream called henrys fork in idaho were stopped in 1986 they were all stopped except this one the reason this was not stopped is that the congress believed it was needed and it could be made environmentally benign if certain adjustments were made in the construction and so the congress imposed certain environmental requirements causing a midlicensing delay on the reconstruction of this dam called island park so this little dam was disadvantaged the only one in the nation to be disadvantaged in this manner by the congress of the united states why did we disadvantage them well because it is a trout fishery because it is one of the nations great trout fisheries that s why we stopped all hydro projects except this one we said to the contractors and supporters of this project if you do it in a certain way we go ahead and license you if notno license now the appropriations committee is saying they have done it they have met the criteria protected the fishery and the project should go forward if this dam was going to hurt this fishery and i am a fisherman from the west i would be opposed to it if this dam was bad environmentally check my environmental record in this house i would be opposed to it but that is not what this dam is going to do this is not a new dam there is no diversion of the water going to take place here there is not going to be 1 inch of new road construction here the prevailing flows will be maintained the stream flow will not be altered the prevailing temperature of the water is going to stay exactly as it is the dissolved oxygen is going to be just as it is the nitrogen is going to be changed all water quality parameters are going to be left unchanged either that or this project is not going to go ahead because that is the law the congress back in 1986 placed that requirement on this little project so environmentally it is very sound as a matter of legislative integrity this committee is simply keeping the word of this congress in allowing this dam to go ahead

support of the conference report to s 1630 the clean air act amendments the nation has waited far too long for congress to improve our air pollution laws our action today will serve to protect and improve our air quality throughout the country the conference report that is before us today represents the most significant environmental accomplishment of the 101st congress our approval of this legislation will lead to the first comprehensive restructuring of our air pollution standards in over a decade it represents the climax of years of negotiation and the triumph of so many members who have sought to protect the health of their constituents and the environment i would also like to recognize the contribution of president bush who made the strengthening of the clean air act a priority if it had not been for president bushs challenge to congress to bring a new and improved clean air act to the white house we would likely still be sifting through the same old morass of legislative proposals while we may disagree with some of the individual provisions within this legislation there is no denying that this bill represents a true compromise that soundly and responsibly addresses this nations clean air needs as a representative of the state of maine i would like to note my specific support for title v of s 1630 which addresses the harmful effects of acid rain when people think of maine they think of forested landscapes dotted with clear lakes and rivers maine depends upon the income that is generated by the forest products industry and the tourism industry which utilize these precious resources the ravages of acid rain can easily lay waste to our forests and lakes which is why maine made the conscious decision to refrain from some industrial growth that would damage our cherished way of life this decision came with a pricelower economic expansion compared to the midwest s 1630 utilizes a system of pollution credits which will allow polluting utilities to choose the most efficient means by which to control their harmful emissions this system is both fair and effectivethe air will be cleaner and the polluters will pay for the costs that was a principle of mine throughout the 1980s and im pleased to see it enshrined in this bill the success of the original clean air act cannot be deniedit is hard to imagine how our air quality would have deteriorated without it nevertheless the united states has changed considerably since 1972 and the need for new regulations is as great today as it was then today we are faced with new problems that were unknown only a decade ago the trend of global warming forces us to find ways of limiting our reliance on fossil fuels and to find cleaner safer and renewable forms of energy ozone presents a particularly tough problem we have too much on the ground and too little in the upper atmosphere i am particularly concerned about ground level ozone because of the nonattainment levels that plague much of maines coast again the conference report addresses this issue fairly and effectively many nonattainment areas including much of maine have high ozone levels due to pollution sources that are downwind s 1630 would allow these areas to be exempted from strict control ilgislation it would not make sense to punish an area that is aleady suffering from a problem that it did not create the american people have waited too long for a new clean air act president bush provided the leadership to move the debate and now the congress has responded with a bill that we all can support it fairly and realistically
