powerwindmills cogeneration small dams and solar electric cellsis viewed by many as too small and dispersed to merit aggressive development in adopting section 210 of the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 purpa congress attempted to tap this reservoir by resolving major institutional barriers to the production of electricity from cogenerators and small power sources congress hoped to unleash the entrepreneurial initiative of small businesses in the effort to resolve our energy problems now those hopes are about to be dashed recent court rulings on federal energy regulatory commissions ferc interpretation of congressional intent have left in doubt the future effectiveness of section 210 that is why today congressman ottinger and i are introducing the cogeneration and small power production program clarification act it is our hope that this legislation will restore regulatory certainty to industry and entrepreneur alike results in the paci ic northwest including my own state of oregon have demonstrated over and over the benefits of section 210 in oregon the timber industry has already tapped this potential for 45 megawatts mw worth of power under the provisions of section 210 it is estimated this capacity will double by 1987 and triple by 1995 in the nation at large the pulp and paper industry has contributed more than 3 500 mw of power to the nations supplyequal to that of three large power plants this capacity will increase by 40 percent by 1987 under the provisions of section 210 the uncertainty over provisions of section 210 translates into risk and the specter of risk translates into cautious investment strategies and difficulttoobtain financing congress perceived the solution to the risk and uncertainty of largescale synthetic fuel projects to be an ambitious package of loans loan guarantees and price supports the ebb and flow of energy prices has beached many of these projects and left the synthetic fuels effort on its deathbed for the entrepeneur planning investments in cogeneration solar or small hydro development no such federal cushions are available these entrepreneurs must contend not only with fluctuating energy prices a constant source of investment uncertainty but also with uncertainties resulting form judicial interpretations of section 210 of purpa the cogeneration and small power production program clarification act restores a sound investment climate for small business by clarifng the congressr nal intent behind ection 210 of purpa that the nation encourage alternatives to capitalintensive centralized plants as sources of power production our bill provides that the power produced from such facilities be bought at rates sufficient to encourage the development of these cogeneration and small power resources while protecting ratepayer interests it also creates a clear federal duty among utilities to interconnect their system to the small power producers in return for the power producers bearing the costs incurred for this hookup the bill is an honest attempt to respond to the recent federal court decision that led to considerable confusion as to the fercs interpretation of congressional intent behind title ii of purpa it is imperative that congress act to address the issues raised by the court in order to preserve the integrity of the purpa program until these issues are resolved small power investors will perceive as too risky the conmitment of funds to such projects the bill introduced today gives small power producers the sound investncat climate they need it provides the certainty the electricity produced will be used or interconnected into the utility grid system it provides that the purchase price will be at least equal to what the utility would otherwise pay for powerthe socalled avoided cost it adds flexibility to present provisions of purpa by authorizing state utility commissions to determine that the public interest may dictate that the appropriate purchase price for small power may be other than full avoided cost to this end the state is given the discretion to set purchase prices based on the type of facility and on whether it is a new or existing facility the results of section 210 in the pacific northwest alone convince me of the merits of our bill but it is questionable how much of this will be developed absent a strong reassertion of the purpa 210 provisions costeffective investments in increased energy productivity are difficult for industry to make in todays tight capital markets when industry must pass over

of the entities under the secs jurisdiction commissioner thomas article follows budoer cuts that boomerang by barbara s thomas omb has recommended that congress adopt a 12 per cent acrosstheboard cut in the budgets of nearly all federal agencies for the current fiscal year the administration apparently intends these cuts to stimulate business development by demonstrating its resolve to reduce the federal deficit ironically however in the case of the securities and exchange commission these budget cuts will result in substantial harm to the very business community that the administration is seeking to assist in a general sense of course it is widely recognized that the secs activities are strongly supportive of legitimate business the commission is a key player in the nations efforts to facilitate capital formation by virtue of its mandate to maintain the honesty and efficiency of the securities markets a reduced commission presence in these markets is likely to be reflected in an increase in market manipulation insider trading and other forms of securities fraud over the long term such misconduct cannot help but have a detrimental effect on the publics confidence in the integrity of the markets and thereby diminish severely the free flow of capital toward productive enterprises what is not so generally recognized is that the commission although noted for its zeal ous pursuit of whitecollar crime also devotes a major portion of its daily staff resources to serving the business community the commission however is a laborintensive agency with a tradition of leanness and efficiency a 12 per cent budget reduction coming on top of a 5 per cent cut suffered in fiscal 1981 and a 3 per cent cut already scheduled to occur in 1982 will require the commission to eliminate one in every five staff positions these cuts will cause a dramatic reduction in the commissions ability to continue those functions that directly serve the business community for example the commissions staff annually reviews and comments upon thou sands of corporate filings containing proposed public disclosures that are mandated by law in many cases this review brings to light significant oisasions or misstatements before an issue of securities reaches the market it thereby reduces theexposure of corporations underwriters and others to afterthefact enforcement actions by the commission and to substantial liability in lawiuits by individual investors if the proposed cuts are enacted this review function will have to be curtailed sharply as a result of existing budget constraints the commission already has been forced to operate this progrsm in a lessthan~satisfactory fashion thus although the commission now reviews all prospectuses filed by new entrants to the securities markets it can do no more than sampile the remainder after the proposed 12 per cent cut the commission would tie able to review only onethird of the filis from new entraxnta and none of thse from repeat filers in addition the review process would be significantly lengthened restilting in the inability of some issueri to take advantage of favorable but rapidly changing market conditions 7he proposed cutbacks also woulddeal a severe bow to the commssionderegula tory efforts which of course directly benefit american business since 1978 the commission has maintained a vigorous program to eliminate or kimplify the many rules that specify required corporate disclosures it also has sought to allevi 1e the burdens that commission regulations impose on small businesses seeking to raise capital by creating broader and more realistic exemptions for such companies the proposed budget reduction will necessitate a decrease in the staff devoted to these important efforts and accordingly delay their implementation there is a tendency among some in the business community to rejoice at the news that one or another vexatious regulatory agency will suffer deep reductions in its budget it is simplistic and often erroneous however to equate such budget reductions with deregulation duplicative needless and confusing regulations will remain on the books until the responsible agency acts to clarify or repeal them in many cases this will require a careful and sustained effort by a high quality staff at the commission much of that staff will have to be sacrificed to the proposed budget cuts and parts of the commissionsderegulatory program saerif iced along with them the tragedy of these losses is compounded by the paucity of the savings that would be achieved by slashing the secs budget the commissions entire budget for the current fiscal year is only 83 million nearly twothirds of which is derived from user fees paid by those who issue or trade securities indeed it may well be possible through modest increases in these fees to make the commission selfsustaining in the near future in a larger sense crippling the sec would be a tragedy reaching far beyond the immediate cost to business and investors the sec is regarded by many as a model government agency known for its efficiency competence and dedication this reputation and this staff are the product of many years of careful management and intense devotion by hundreds of people they were not built in a day but they could be destroyed virtually overnight"], [0.14426736533641815,

erode all our rights set forth in our constitution today we have before us a means to help achieve this basic principle embodied in our pledge that we are a nation with justice for all not just justice for the rich or politically elite but for everyonethe poor the elderly the disadvantaged in the last 6 years the legal services corporation has achieved minimum access to legal aid for the poor of our nation it has not been an easy task but last year lsc obtained its goal of 2 lawyers for every 10 000 poor people in our country the legal services corporation is one of our best examples of an effective and efficient use of federal funds of the 1 5 million legal matters handled by legal services attorneys only 15 percent actually resulted in litigation in my own district the inland

nearly all the rest will go directly to field programs to provide legal services with the remainder being spent on program support field monitoring and the like legal services to the poor have come a long way since 1919 when reginald heber smith in his book justice and the poor concluded that the united states was not fulfilling its promise of equal justice for all legal aid organizations throughout the country had been trying to fill the gap and made great strides toward this effort but simply could not be expected to keep up with the demand during the great depression when legal services for the poor were most needed most legal aid organizations had to cut services not increase them even during the relative prosperity of the 1950s growth in legal services while substantial could not keep pace another alternative was required as early as 1925 chief justice william howard taft remarked if the individual in seeking to protect himself is without money to avail himself of such a legal procedure the constitution and the procedure made inviolable by it do not practically work for the equal benefit of all something must be devised by which everyone however lowly and however poor however unable by his means to employ a lawyer and to pay court costs shall be furnished the opportunity to set this fixed machinery of justice going it was nearly 40 years later before the federal government began supplying the poor with any legal services and nearly 50 years before the legal services corporation was formed on an independent basis it is not accidental that the legal services corporation concept was formed during the civil rights era it was realized that it was in the publics interest to secure the allegiance of the poor despite economic and social grievances to our legal system for the peaceful resolution of disputes to maintain law and order the poor must respect the legal system and perceive that it is fair essential to that perception is that everyone including the poor enjoy effective access to it the key to access to the legal system is a lawyer as the supreme court has stated the right to be heard would be in many cases of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel providing the poor with a lawyer does nothing more than provide them with the right to be heard it does not guarantee the right to win can we in good conscience deny them this simple right to be heard but not with federal moneys many counter yet each year taxpayers are permitted to deduct billions of dollars in legal fees from their income tax returns such deductions mean a loss of tax revenues for the government and represent just as real a cost to taxpayers as do expenditures of money from the treasury the cost to the public of the deductionsabout 12 billion for corporations alone in 1978dwarfs the comparatively tiny 260 million budget for the legal services corporation if we do not continue the lsc we will not only be denying the poor legal counsel but we will be continuing to subsidize the legal counsel of the rich this imbalance of justice must not be tolerated the block grant approach is not an answer to this dilemma to incorporate the legal services corporation into a block grant would surely consign it to its death the block grant proposed by president reagan does not include any moneys for lsc in addition there has been little interest at the state or local government level in providing legal services virtually no such interest was demonstrated before the federal funding effort started in 1965 and very little has been forthcoming since that time to supplement the federal program currently state and local governments contribute only a little more than 5 million to legal services programs a sum equivalent to 1 65 percent of the lsc budget finally the block grant approach would surely cause more politicization than we will ever have under the present federal arrangement the elimination of the legal services corporation would not serve to reduce waste in government to get the government off the backs of the people or to return local programs to the states nor would the elimination of lsc in any way help to balance the budget or reduce inflation i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the legal services corporation and maintain the struggle for justice for all to permit the poor as well

strategy not only will provide greater fiscal control but will allow us to better target our assistance to individuals and areas most in need given the continuing severe housing crisis facing this nation and the significant budget reductions made in these activities during the previous session i believe that alternatives must be considered expeditiously i do not believe that we can reduce these resources further without calling into question this nations commitment to affordable housing and a decent living environment for its citizens although this bill is being introduced in the house in the context of an omnibus housing initiative being offered by the committee majority it is my intention to pursue and refine this initiative with both majority and minority members of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs i believe that we can come up with a balanced housing package which is both fiscally respon ible and yet responds to the various dimensions of a national problem of increasing proportions any housing policy which places sole reliance on income support measures will not represent a comprehensive approach to current needs and in fact will prove counterproductive in supply constrained areas mr president this action is essential if we are to begin to reverse the conditions contributing to a national hous ing shortage reaching crisis dimensions this crisis is especially severe with respect to the availability of rental housing today americans who want to rent housing cannot find decent affordable housing opportunities the vacancy rate for rental housing shows no signs of improving from the recent record low levels demographic trends as well as the continuing prohibitive costs of homeownership will increase the already high demand for rental housing as the baby boom generation comes of age and individuals choose to live in smaller households more and more people will need rental housing in my state of connecticut the production of multifamily housing units fell by 30 8 percent from 1978 to 1981 last year only 9 000 total housing starts were recorded for the entire state against a projected annual demand of 25 000 units in the housing plan released last year by the connecticut department of housing it was estimated that 175 000 households were either living in substandard housing or paying excessive portions of their income for rent the rental vacancy rate in the state is below 2 percent and lower than that in most major cities in stamford for example the vacancy rate is zero and with the exception of several federally sponsored projects virtually no rental units were constructed over the past decade despite unprecendented demand the supply of rental housing has been exacerbated further by the loss of existing units as the inventory ages and is not replaced anthony downs in the future of rental housing in america estimated that the gap between rental needs and production in the decade of the 1980s will range from 1 1 to 4 6 million units the study housing needs in the eighties published by icf inc predicts a shortage of 3 5 million rental units over the course of the decade the crisis in the rental housing industry is real and the outlook is not encouraging a 1979 gao report states that the rental housing market could be likened to an endangered species dangerously low vacancy rates aggravate already inflationary rents thereby threatening the ability of moderate and lowincome americans to afford decent housing the legislation i am proposing embodies certain important principles for the future of federal housing policy this initiative overcomes the budgetary criticism of the section 8 prgram the congress will regain annual control over these activities and will not incur the longterm obligations inherent in the current programs resources will be delivered more efficiently as a result of the separation of affordability and availability concerns in addition state and local officials will become an equal partner in the development process this will insure better coordination and leverage of resources as well as highlight the importance of local support in the planning and location of housing developments so as to spur neighborhood development and mitigate displacement most importantly this proposal reaffirms the premise that the government has an obligation to respond to the housing needs of all our citizens who are not being served or provided with decent affordable housing opportunities by the private sector this will be accomplished at the lowest possible cost in a manner which anticipates maximum participation by other governmental entities and the private sector mr president the purpose of this bill is to increase the nations stock of affordable rental and cooperative housing state and local governments would make application for assistance to encourage the construction or rehabilitation of multifamily developments in areas found to be experiencing severe shortages of decent rental housing opportunities as determined by objectively measurable indices in conjunction with the private sector these governmental entities would have broad flexibility in designing the type of program assistance necessary to respond to prevailing local housing market conditions for example the assistance could be utilized as a capital grant or loan annual interest reduction payments or other comparable means to reduce project debt service and thereby create affordable market able housing in accordance with locally identified needs funds could be directed for either new construction substantial rehabilitation or moderate rehabilitation the amount of assistance would be the least amount required to provide modestly designed housing in an area for families or individuals without other reasonable and affordable alternatives in the private market in addltion the amount of assistance would be sufficient to provide affordable rents in at least 20 percent of the units in any assisted development to families with incomes below 30 percent of area median income a project selection priority is established for proposals which exceed this later requirement in terms of either the percentage or length of commitment to our lower income citizens the bill contains other selection criteria designed to assure that only feasible proposals which maximize the necessary federal assistance will be selected including the degree to which such assistance will be eventually repaid to the federal government although this is a highly targeted program the secretary of hud is directed to make resources available in different geographic regions and in nonmetropolitan as well as urban areas if any conditions of this assistance are breached or the owner sells or converts the development during the term of assistance the amount of federal contribution must be repaid in full with accumulated interest while the secretary will continue to regulate rent levels as is the case in current assisted housing programs a new feature has been added to expedite consideration of rent requests from private owners in conclusion this proposal attempts to c ercome the criticisms of current programs and incorporates both in terms of philosophy and program design many elements of other pending initiative such as housing block grants and the administrations recent

country the administration is determined to go ahead with its cuts in federal construction programs the poor are not the only ones who will be hurt by these cutbacks in construction the housing industry will also be hurt by these cuts which come at a time when the industry can least afford it already suffering from high unemployment rates and from a squeeze on its financial resources these cuts in construction outlays will deal another severe blow to the construction business it is not just construction programs that the administration proposes to eliminate the administration calls for cuts in funding of operating and rehabilitation expenses for public housing as well while public housing programs have come a long way in providing decent housing for our nations poor the need for government expenditures in this area had far from disappeared without taking into account the administrations budget cuts for this year public housing authorities across the country already face tremendous difficulties public housing authorities in chicago and detroit are deeply in debt and those operating in boston philadelphia newark and st paul have exhausted their operating reserves the problem for phas is more than just meeting operating expenses the need for more units of public housing and for rehabilitation of existing units is tremendous 11ationwide over 10 percent of all public housing needs improvements in new york state as a whole and in my district in the bronx this figure jumps to over 25 percent furthermore there is a need for additions to the housing stock in new york city the official rate of vacancy of rental units is less than 2 3 percent not only has the reagan administration proposed to eliminate the section 8 and ioublic housing construction programs and cut funds for operation and rehabilitation of public housing the administration has recommended the overhaul of section 8 existing program which provides rent supplement payments changes in section 8 existing fall in two main categories first revisions in recipient contributions and second establishment of a voucher system in an effort to reduce the cost of section 8 existing the reagan administration has introduced a series of measures which seek to increase the amount an individual will have to contribute toward housing first rather than contributing 15 to 25 percent of their income to rent recipient will now be required to spend 30 percent of their income toward rent the amount that an individual will have to contribute will actually be higher because the administration would require that food stamps be counted as part of income in new york the requirement that food stamps be counted as income will in and of itself raise rents 26 percent the cultural effect of all the changes is more devastating in addition to modifying the formula for calculating recipient contributions the administrations plan calls for establishing avoucher program while the budget does not detail the type of voucher program advocated the central thrust of such a proposition is to decrease government involvement in housing and to increase reliance on the private sector by issuing vouchers which may be used toward paying rent on a unit which recipients locate themselves a study by the pratt center concluded that such a plan would be unworkable in new york given the citys extremely low rental vacancy rate furthermore the voucher plan would effectively eliminate the ability of the government to target housing assistance to particular neighborhoods consequently the abandonment and decline of some urban neighborhoods is likely to continue if the only alternative of the congress were to adopt or reject the republican budget substitutes the future of housing in this country would be very bleak fortunately the democratic alternatives would continue budget authority and outlays for housing at fiscal year 1982 levels and thus permit funding of the omnibus housing bill h r 5731 introduced by representative gonza ez and reported out by the house banking committee the gonzalez proposal addresses the needs of low and moderateincome people who live in rural as well as urban areas targets assistance to those who need assistance the most and maintains upgrades and expands the public housing stock the gonzalez housing proposal may be divided into three parts lowincome housing assistance a new multifamily housing production program and help for singlefamily homeowners the gonzalez proposal authorizes 12 5 billion for additional lowincome housing assistance this money would be spent both for modernization of public housing units and the construction of an additional 136 000 units the additional units include 15 000 public housing units 25 000 section 8 existing units and 76 000 conversions to section 8 from other programs as well 4 000 indian public housing units and 16 000 section 202 units for the elderly or handicapped in addition to its rehabilitation and construction provisions the gonzalez bill includes 32 million for public housing projects with operating deficits and a financial adjustment factor faf to make new section 8 projects which are already in the pipeline feasible in addition to these lowincome housing assistance programs the gonzalez bill calls for continued assistance of rural housing programs at 1982 funding levels and for the establishment of new multifamily housing production program the new multifamily housing production program would support 50 000 to 100 000 additional units of which at least 20 percent must be for lowerincome households the legislation stipulates that these projects be located in areas with a severe shortage of rental housing opportunities for families and individuals without other reasonable and affordable housing alternatives in the private market in recognition of the difficulties presently facing singlefamily homeownerf and the construction industry the gonzalez plan calls for programs which aid families that already own their own homes and those who wish to acquire homes the first of these programs would continue and expand the 235 program according to the national low income housing coalition this program would assist some 100 000 in financing their homes a second program would provide 760 million in emergency loans for some 76 000 homeowners to assist homeowners and the construction industry the bill sets aside 3 5 billion for construction of singlefamily homes and condos and provides interest subsidies down to a 9 5 percent rate for 10 years with half of the subsidies paid back at the time of resale additionally all pha mortgage and insurance programs would be extended for another year the bill also contains a small but significant provision which authorizes 3 million for the neighborhood reinvestment corporation to expand its demonstration program of mutual housing associations a mutual housing association is a private nonprofit corporation which develops owns and manages housing for people of low and moderate income the concept is based on extensive experience in western europe with professional nonprofit housing associations i initiated this concept in the congress 2 years ago and am delighted the housing subcommittee decided to provide additional support for the excellent work done by the neighborhood reinvestment corporation in testing the potential of mutual housing associations to help meet american housing problems if the gonzalez proposal were adopted we would maintain our present federal commitment to decent and affordable housing on the other hand to adopt the presidents plan would be to strike at the core of federal housing programs in this country the stark difference between the two proposals may be seen by examining the effect of each on the production of new lowincome housing units the presidents proposed rescissions and budget cuts would result in the loss of nearly onehalf million units over the next 10 years with some 300 000 of these resulting from the cancellation of projects already in the pipeline the gonzalez bill would save these 300 000 units and add an additional 136 000 units this contrast between the republican and democratic budget alternatives presents yet another powerful reason for the house to reject the budget substitutes offered by

proposals may have on our nations infrastructure by infrastructure i am referring generally to those more or less perma nent structures that constitute the underlying foundation on which our nation is built i am not referring to our very important expenditures on the health and education of our nations populace but rather on the capital investment that we make which contributes iraneasurably to a strong america these investments if i may generalize further require governmental involvement since their cost exceeds the benefits that accrue to any interested individual or enterprise several years ago i had the privilege of serving on the national transportation policy study commission chaired by my good friend and colleague from pennsylvania among that commissions findings was that our public sector transportation capital investment requirements by the year 2000 exceed 1 trillion the american transportation advisory council a coalition of business organizations concerned with the future of the total transportation industry has produced a report atac ii the focus of which is a bit more immediate than was the ntpsc study according to the very fine atac ii report this nations transportation capital needs from 1981 through 1990 will in 1980 dollars total 401 billion assuming annual inflation rates of 10 percent that figure escalates to 623 billion of this total 404 billion is for the countrys highway system alone the federal highway administration has indicated that our total highway system is wearing out at an annual rate 50 percent faster than it is being replaced at the present time according to the road information program the percentage of miles on our interstate system rated as being in good condition has dropped from 74 to 63 percent in the past 10 years that means that 37 percent or about 15 000 miles is in need of some repair to help address this problem the house public works and transportation committee has recently reported out legislation increasing the interstate 4r program to 2 1 billion this is a level of funding that most knowledgeable individuals democrat or republican conservative and liberals regard as nearly approaching our minimum needs our interstate system instituted in 1956 was built to have a design life of 20 years many segments are now approaching that age because roads deteriorate from fair to poor condition much more quickly than from good to fair it is imperative that this nation move quickly to repair its roads before they crumble if we do not they will soon be crumbling all around us it is not of course only the interstate system that is in need of repair the road information program estimates that over half the nations paved road network now suffers from substandard pavement conditions i find that to be a shocking fact reflecting a situation that must not be permitted to go unchecked if the deterioration continues our trucking industry will suffer paralyzing the movement of much of our nations freight and the level of personal mobility which americans have come to expect will of course also decline similarly our nations public transit needs are enormous the atac ii study has placed transit infrastructure needs over the next decade at about 50 billion in 1980 dollars the american public transit association estimates that about 16 percent of this is for bus purchases and this excludes fleet expansion beyond that which is necessary to maintain generally existing levels of service with respect to urban population growth 26 percent is for railfixed facility modernization 10 percent for rail rolling stock replacement and modernization 9 percent for planned rail extensions 16 percent for the completion of new systems 15 percent for new rail starts and 5 percent for bus facilities if these investments are not made public transit will be rendered obsolete with out population becoming once again utterly dependent on the singlepassenger automobile and its associated degradation of the air we breathe usurpation of valuable urban and rural real estate and addiction to petroleum with respect to our aviation infrastructure needs the development needs of our nations airports are great if they are to accommodate the increased growth and traffic in both commuter and general aviation that is projected through the remainder of this century according to a november 1980 federal aviation administration document national aviation system development and capital needs for the decade 19821991 air carrier enplanements will grow 61 2 percent and commuter enplanements will increase by a staggering 170 percent between 1979 and 1991 additionally the faa forecast projects that we will witness a 150percent increase in airport operationp during this decade compared to the 1970s associated with this projected congestion in the skies are substantial capital development needs whichin the past few yearshave hopelessly lingered behind system needs inflation has consistently eaten away at the nations principal program supporting air development adap costs for actual airport construction increased 60 percent during the 4year period of 197679however during 1976 through 1980 adap funding levels were increased by only 33 percent the situation with respect to airport facilities and equipment is no better according to a federal aviation administration study in constant dollars recent spending for f e has declined to little more than a third of 1972 levels the report concluded that this decline in real capital investment has left the faa with an aged inventory of equipment requiring higher levels of maintenance and continuously increasing costs serious deterioraton of system performance is unavoidable unless capital investment levels are increased significantly turning to our nations port infrastructure historically the federal government has played an important role in the development of our nations seaports over the past 150 years we have assumed the cost of providing anchorages harbors main shipping channels navigation aids and major public works such as breakwaters nonfederal interests have 3 provided shoreside facilities and dredging within pierhead linesi the nonfederal contribution to port development has in fact exceeded the federal contribution local port authorities having invested over 6 billion in ports since 1946 as compared to the corps of engineers total investment over the last 150 years of about 5 billion for navigation projects when one considers that in fiscal year 1981 customs revenues exceeded 9 billion it becomes apparent that port development is a very good investment but more than a good investment this nations system of deep water and river ports is a national economic treasure ports are a vital component of our domestic and foreign waterborne commerce our countrys approximately 200 deep water and river ports make a significant contribution to the national state and local economies to this countrys total transportation network and to our military security but there is presently a bottleneck in the development of our port infrastructure and i am concerned that this bottleneck may be at the federal level but and let me stress this we face the critical problem that the federal governments navigation and channel development responsibilities have not kept up with the local port role in shoreside facility development while the new generation of ships are get ting bigger and deeper and trade volumes are expanding the federal government has done very little in the way of deep draft navigation development for example there has not been one navigation project authorized in the past 6 years it is clear that as we move into the 1980s the federal government must continue its role in port development according to a marad report the marine terminal facility requirements of this nations deep water ports in the decade of the eighties will be over 5 billion and for our river ports it will be 4 8 billion new container facilities are required as well as expanded bulk facilities especially coal grain oil and liquefied natural gas the united states is perhaps more dependent on world trade than it has ever been twenty percent of our gnp is accounted for by foreign trade95 percent of that trade volume is by waterborne cargo that constituted a 15 billion contribution to our gnp in 1977 and our trade volume is expected to double by the end of the century the unitedstates port system should not be limited by the federal navigation system it is critical that the federal government maintain a navigation capacity consistent with this countrys international trade and defense requirements i commend to all of our colleagues the october 26 1981 edition of business week among its observations are thatin the past local politicians have responded to financial stress by postponing the maintenance of existing capital plant and deferring the building of new plants much the same way an executive in the private sector acts when his company is in a financial bind says new york state comptroller edward v reagan you can always delay public investment but in the end it catches up with you even more ominous and pertinent to our present deliberations was the following from business week i urge our colleagues attention the economic expansion president reagan is predicting requires a strong and healthy public infrastructure industry cannot expand without adequate water and sewage systems and wellmaintained roads bridges and mass transit systems to get its employees to work and its goods to market for the presidents plan to work for anybodys budget plan to work we need a strong infrastructure if the federal government fails to meet todays challenges by failing to meet the needed capital investment we will certainly need to redouble those efforts in the very near future in the interim our nation will suffer and they those capital investments are eventually made as is inevitable the cost will be much greater every homeowner knows that the time to repair a floorboard is before it caves in this nations infrastructure is about to cave in and i would suggest that this

spending programs are in jeopardy in retrospect it would appear that too great an emphasis on either supplyside or demand economics leads to imbalances in the economy and that the tax act of 1981 was slanted a bit too much toward supplyside incentives accordingly new demandoriented consumer incentives are needed to give the economy a shortterm shot in the arm to allow the longer term supplyside program a chance to work it simply does not make sense to provide companies incentives to expand if there is no demand for their products moreover a careful review of several provisions of the 1981 tax act raises questions about tax equity as well as economic priorities for example the social case for providing new tax incentives for the petroleum industry which is capital rather than laborintensive demands review as chairman of the newly created house republican task force on job creation i am introducing legislation today to give the economys jobintensive industries a powerful boost specifically aimed at spurring the stricken automobile housing and farm implement industries the measure calls for the creation of three new tax incentives first a 750 tax creditwhich is equivalent to a 1 500 tax deduction for a family at the 50percent tax bracket or a 3 000 tax deduction for a family at the 25percent tax bracketfor individuals purchasing a new car in second a tax credit of up to 5 000 for families purchasing a newly constructed home in 1982 and third an extra 10percent tax credit up to 5 000 for the purchase of new farm equipment this year adoption of these proposals will entrail a cost to the treasury but this cost can be more than offset by plugging several of the corporate welfare loopholes congress created in the 1981 tax act the provision for example which allows companies which lose money to sell through intricate leasing arrangembnts their tax losses to profitmaking enterprises should be eliminated as should the reduction congress authorized in the windfall profits tax on oil companies the leasing provisions of the 1981 tax act represent a particularly outrageous assault on the tax codes to reward the inefficient by allowing companies which lose money to sell their tax losses is to stultify the economy and shift an unfair amount of the burden of funding government from wall street to main street big business is the sole beneficiary of the leasing provisions to the competitive disadvantage of small business and at the expense of the individual taxpayer the recently enacted reduction in the windfall profits tax on the oil industryparticularly in light of the recent merger mania in the industrycan only be termed unconscionable there is simply no industry which deserves a tax break less today than big oil hopefully the tradeoffs involved in the jobs creation package introduced this week will provide persuasive arguments for members to adopt a corrective rather than radical approach to tax revision the alternative i fear to corrective legislation is either intransigence on an imperfect tax policy or return to the big tax policies of the 1970s the institution of incentives to employment in distressed industries implies a change of emphasis from corporate welfare to consumer concern it also implies a shift in emphasis from the nonlabor intensive oil industry to the jobintensive sector of economic production in the midwest and northeast such a shift is clearly called for when over 400 000 people are out or work in the auto industry and the even more laborintensive construction industry is at its lowest level since in addition we have a profound national interest in stimulating purchases on new automobiles the current generation of cars marks a quantum improvement in gasoline mileage standards and thus a significant step energy independence moreover given the fact that the government has guaranteed massive loans to one auto maker a return to profitability in the industries could result in sizable savings of public funds it is time for congress to look at the job losses piling up in basic american industries and turn its attention to helping the uaw assembly line worker instead of the oil company executive it is also time for the justice department to reembrace the teddy roosevelt tradition of forceful antitrust enforcement the reagan economic program will be jeopardized if big business is allowed to use its newly given tax breaks to rearrange corporate ownership instead of creating new jobs and increasing productivity antitrust policy should take into consideration the effect of mergers on jobs creation as well as industrial concentration if american business is to preserve the tax incentives congress has provided an economic and social commitment must be made to building rather than buying expanding industries rather than concentrating stock ownership jobs creation rather than elimination"], [0.748589277267456, 0.748589277267456, 0, "in his recent address before the joint session of congress the president spelled out a clear choice for the congress in its buget deliberations i plan to support the president and vote for the grammlatta budget p~roposal as a first step in our efforts to revive our economy the administration has fully embraced the grammlatta proposal as the president said reducing the growth of spending cutting marginal ti rates providing relief from ovcrrcguiatitn and following a noninfliationary and predictable monetary policy are interwoven measures whiich will insurc that we have addresscd each of the severe dislocations which threaten our economic future there can be no doubt that we arc facing an increasingly severe economic crisis federal spending taxes and inflation have exploded in recent years and the federal government has been one of the major detonators in 1970 federal budget authority was 212 billion by the end of the decade it had surged to 568 billion or 23 percent of the gross national product unfortunately revenues have not kept up with runaway spending consequently the federal budget was in deficit every year of the past decade in 1970 the deficit was a modest 2 8 billion in 1980 it was nearly 60 billion these annual deficits have caused our total national debt to more then double in the past decade going from some 400 billion in 1971 to nearly 1 trillion today it cost this country 73 billion last year just to pay the interest on this trillion dollar debt obviously this profligate spending must stop but it is not easy to bring to a halt the lumbering voracious giant know as the federal budget one of the greatest obstacles to fiscal discipline is the problem of entitlements spending mandated by law or contract the share of the budget taken by entitlements has grown by two thirds in the past 14 yearsfrom 36 percent in 1967 to 59 percent today with 16 percent of the budget going to borrowing authority guaranteed loans and off budget agencies less than 25 percent of the budget remains in direct control of congress one need only look at some of these programs to understand how massive and uncontrollable the entitlement problem has become food stamp costs have doubled in the past 3 years from 5 2 billion in 1979 to 10 3 billion in 1981 six million americans were added to the food stamp roles in that period so 23 million people or 1 out of 10 americans now participate in the program medicaid is another disturbing example costs of medicaid rose from 5 2 billion in 1970 to 29 billion in 1981 an average of over 1 300 is spent annually on each medicaid recipient uncontrolled federal spending is a problem in itself but it creates an additional problem namely inflation lax monetary policies have resulted in a climate of continuing inflation inflation has grown from 1 percent per year in the early 1960s to nearly 13 percent in the last 2 years in december we saw record high inflation of 13 percent and shortterm interest rates of over 21 percent the basic necessitiesfood housing clothing and health carehave skyrocketed for example mortgage interest rates now average almost 15 percent and more than 90 percent of those who rent cannot afford to buy a home inflation also exacerbates the problem of high taxes inflation creates bracket creep whereby individuals are pushed into higher and higher tax brackets after receiving wage increases designed to offset inflation instead taxes offset the wage increase as taxes rise faster than inflation every 10 percent increase in income produces an astonishing 15 percent increase in federal personal income tax receipts federal personal taxes on each family have nearly quadrupled in the past 15 years growing from 1 500 for an average family in 1965 to 5 500 in 1980 you do not have to be an einstein to know that you cannot get ahead under such conditions given these conditions it is no surprise that savings rates have plummeted in the late 1960s and early 1970s americans save between 7 to 9 percent of disposable income in 1980 the rate had dropped to 5 percent this appalling rate of savings contributes to a serious shortage of capital needed for investment to improve productivity and promote longterm growth this country faces significant economic problems but they are certainly not insurmountable a plan must be adopted to reduce federal spending cut marginal tax rates provide relief from overregulation and maintain a predictable monetary policy grammlatta is such a plan the grammlatta bipartisan proposal contains 6 3 billion less in budget authority 6 1 billion less in outlays the same amount of revenues and a deficit 6 1 billion lowe than the reagan plan it is an effective bipartisan approach conversely the jones budget provides more of the same policies that created the economic quagmire the jones measure provides more spending than the bipartisan budget and substantially less tax relief in effect mk jones proposes to offer a lower deficit through higher taxres this is unacceptable some individuals have questioned the wisdom of the presidents tax cut proposal and would prefer to see a balanced budget before reducing taxes i think a few points need emphasis actually the president is not proposing to reduce federal taxes but only to reduce the rate of increase in taxes a gigantic tax increase is built into the system and the real question becomes one of reducing the amount of that increase without the presidents proposal federal tax receipts will increase some 308 billion over the next 3 years president reagan wants to cut that increase by 136 billion the president proposes to cut individual tax rates across the board for 3 years the tax cuts would be concentrated on the middle class taxpayers with net earnings of 10 000 to 60 000 now pay 72 percent of all personal taxes and would receive 73 percent of the benefits under the presidents plan the president would also allow faster writeoffs of investments on new plants and equipment the combined reduction of personal and business taxes will provide vital incentives to work save and invest because taxpayers will be able to keep more of the money they earn as this program returns economic autonomy to the taxpayer it also returns decisionmaking authority to the state and local level state and local governments will decide on their priorities what services to fund and how to deliver those services this in itself will produce savings and efficiency a number of people have expressed concern over the effect the cuts will have on the most needy i am acutely aware of these concerns because i come from one of the poorest states in the country in terms of per capita income maine is among the 10 most impoverished states after factoring in the high cost of energy we are actually the poorest state in the union i assure you that i understand the importance of acting prudently to protect the people of my state and of the nation but we must remember that our problems did not evolve overnight and they are not going to go away overnight this is the first step not the final solution but this first step is very important and we must take it now the plan is not written in stone it is likely that some adjustments will be necessary the program will be scrutinized closely but it has to be given an opportunity to work no one is hurt more by stagflation than the poor the elderly and those living on fixed incomes and no one will benefit more from reduced inflation and a healthy economy i will certainly continue to monitor the program with the

measure to assist small private charitable foundations in their efforts to serve the needs of their local communities in agricultural states such as illinois it is common for people to donate farmland to small charitable foundations for the support of local libraries parks recreation facilities and other community service projects under current law in order to qualify as a taxexempt private operating foundation a foundation must annually distribute for charitable purposes an amount equal to a percentage of the value of its assets if a foundation does not distribute the necessary amount the internal revenue service will assess a tax penalty equal to the difference between the amount distributed and an amount equal to a percentage of the value of the incomeproducing assets in 1969 when the distribution requirement was added to the internal revenue code small private foundations supported primarily by agricultural holdings had no problem meeting the distribution requirements however since that time the value of an acre of farmland has increased much faster than the per acre gross return in illinois since 1969 the average value of farmland has increased by 333 percent while the per acre gross return for corn and soybeans has increased by only 231 and 235 percent respectively as land values outpace income the distribution requirement for qualifying as a private operating foundation becomes more difficult to meet for small foundations whose primary incomeproducing resource is farmland one bad growing season due to drought or flood or the continued escalation of farmland values could result in a foundation being forced to sell a portion of its farmland and distribute the proceeds in order to avoid the imposition of the tax penalty such a result would be counterproductive as it would reduce the ability of the foundation to fulfill its charitable purpose in future years the bill i am introducing today will insure that these foundations will not suffer a diminished capacity to perform their vital community functions due to a bad crop or the further extraordinary escalation of farmland values this measure will allow small private foundations to determine the value of their farmland for distribution requirements by using a valuation method currently used for valuing inherited farmlandsection 203a e of the internal revenue code at a time when we are asking the private sector to shoulder more responsibility for community services we need to encourage the continuation of generous and caring local charitable activity this bill will assist that effort by assuring potential donors of agricultural land that their charitable intentions will not be frustrated due to an outdated and inflexible tax formula e"], [0.7408682107925415,

would seem to me members of the committee that all the people on this floor who believe strongly and powerfully that this drug problem must be addressed i would simply say to them in the process of

civilian function and the military function i do not think we need 226 billion to be talking about waging war in the world let alone waging war in this country i find it ludicrous and tragic that many

of human beings but since much of our money is going to the pentagon maybe we ought to let the corps of engineers build the housing your response would be that is a civilian function we do not need the military to engage in this activity i am simply saying to you if it is not good enough to try to build mass transit to educate our children it is reasonable to say that we will not do it in terms of law enforcement if we have a significant problem of law enforcement in this country then let us address it but let us not delude ourselves into believing we can simply throw the ball to the military and run home and say i have done something for the drug problem when we have perverted and distorted our way of government we need to effectively keep that dichotomy between civilian and military once we put law enforcement people in military uniform we conjure up in peoples minds the agony of nazi germany and the pain in the 1960s when many in this country chose not to address the problems and we were forced to have the military deal with it i do not think the drug enforcement agents are saying we do not want to implement the laws what they are saying is we need the necessary

corporations utilizing the expertise and foreign presence of banks they will be able to package export services ranging from marketing surveys to finding buyers from arranging shipping to product

been to place all banks foreign and domestic on an equal footing and under the same legal requirements this means that a foreignowned bank doing business in this country will not have an unfair advantage in this market as they too will be covered by this law for the first time they will also be subject to the limitations of this act which will be based on their worldwide capital and surplus just as it is for a domestic bank under the language of this bill acceptances will for the first time be available to smaller and mediumsized exporters in the past the restrictions on the amount of acceptances that could be outstanding limited them to only the largest exporters but in this legislation we have increased the amount that can be outstanding as a result smaller firms will for the first time have access to this lowcost form of export finance even more importantly for the first time we are allowing smaller banks to offer their customers access to export financing they will be able to both purchase shares of any acceptances issued in behalf of their larger customers and to originate them for their smaller customers through the mechanism of acceptances this committee has worked long and hard to come up with the best way to give these banks and exporters access to this type of trade financing and has allowed them to be participated through other banks we have been very specific about how these acceptances should be written and have come to the conclusion that only the name of the issuing bank needs to be placed on the acceptance as this conference report states we did not do this to impinge or restrict the inherent powers of the federal reserve to prevent circumvention of these requirements through imprudent use of acceptances however we have also made it very clear that we will not accept either regulatory or other restrictions that would unduly limit the use of bankers acceptances and participations by the widest numbe of american banks this means that we expect the method detailed in the house report on h r 6016 to be implemented without major regulatory interference we make note of the study being conducted by the federal financial institutions regulatory council and if after a period of actual use there are problems with this method we expect them to report to us any individual regulatory action that would affect the general use of participations before it is taken except for major emergencies in my own personal view this expansion of acceptance financing will prove a major advance for thousands of small and mediumsized exporters by making them available through smaller banks we are confident that the cost of exporting will be lowered and that exporters will be able to increase sales and employment this legislation is a major beginning not only in expanding foreign trade but in modernizing our system of financial institutions however much else remains to be done next year for far too long banks and thrifts have been unable to give their customers the services they need and desire because of outdated laws of another era we took another major step already today by providing assistance to thrift institutions however we cannot afford to sit back now and think that we have completed our work there is still a great deal to do in the next congress we still need to reexamine outdated legislation such as the glasssteagall act this bill is a major step along a road that we still have many miles to travel on this act s 734 is a major step to both increasing foreign trade and to allowing financial institutions to compete and i urge my collegues to support it"], [0.0003733038902282715, 0.5003733038902283, 0, "this amendment is designed to discourage the wholesale issuance of diplomatic automobile license plates of which there are reportedly in excess of 3 300 in the washington metropolitan area the amendment would prevent the state department from certifying the accredited diplomatic status of more than two applicants per foreign mission who are seeking diplomatic license plates from the various local motor vehicle departments the proliferation of distinctive diplomatic vehicle tags serves to constantly remind americans in the washington area of the many special privileges accorded to the large diplomatic community and of the abuses of those privileges and the thoughtless arrogance too frequently exhibited by holders of diplomatic license plates to put the matter in perspective i will give a few statistics the unitedstatess r has 136 accredited diplomats but 213 vehicles with diplomatic license plates mexico has 42 diplomats but 92 cars with diplomatic plates nigeria has 35 diplomats and 74 cars with diplomatic plates the situation for other embassies both large and small is approximately the same in addition to the sheer number of diplomatic vehicles in washington d c and the vicinity we have the problem of diplomatic abuse of traffic rules and regulations we have all heard of accidents where the diplomat has either left the scene of the accident unlawfully and or has refused to compensate the injured american after the fact i sincerely hope that the person eventually designated to fill the proposed new position of director of foreign missions within the state department will give careful attention to abuses by diplomats in the operation and parking of automobiles in this area furthermore i hope he or she will take prompt action to try to minimize the inconvenience and annoyance too often caused americans by insensitive diplomatic motorists"]]}
