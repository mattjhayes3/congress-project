the situation is likely to get even worse in the future at the end of the second quarter of this year more than 1 5 million american homeowners were at least 30 days behind in their monthly mortgage payments while another 150 000 faced foreclosure observers attribute todays recordbreaking statistics to the current recession as many people are either out of work or just finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet yet many experts warn that nontraditional home financing techniques will be the source of the problem tomorrow the term balloon mortgage refers to those shortterm loans that require a lumpsum payment upon maturityusually 3 to 5 years until then however the home buyer usually makes interestonly payments in most cases these balloon mortgages are sellerfinanced at interest rates which are below the going market rates the size of the loan represents the difference between the sales price and the sum of the downpayment and the assumed first mortgage for example if the sales price of the home was 100 000 the downpayment 25 000 and the value of the first mortgage was 50 000 the balloon mortgage would amount to 25 000 if the loan had a 12percent interest rate the buyer would make monthly payments of 250 until maturity when the entire principal of 25 000 would be due most people took out these type of home loans as a stopgap measure they could not afford a conventional longterm loan for the entire amount they wished to finance so they made up the difference with a balloon mortgage and planned to refinance their homes when the market improved and interest rates went down they assumed that at least one of the following would happen interest rates would go down and money would be available for refinancing or the property would appreciate in value and could be sold at a profit or they would have enough additional income to qualify for a new loan it is the failure of those assumptions to come to pass that are at the root of the problems many foresee concerning balloon mortgages the federal reserve boards tightmoney policy has led to an alarming shortage of funds those funds that are available are beyond the reach of most americans in fact mortgage money is so expensive that almost 95 percent of the people in this country cannot qualify for home loans housing prices have gone stagnant and in some areas have actually declined in addition more than 10 million people are out of worka national unemployment rate of 9 8 percent people are glad to keep their jobs let alone get raises these factors in combination with the other ill effects of the worst recession in nearly half a century have destroyed the entire housing industry and signaled a potential disaster for those people whose shortterm loans are coming due experts estimate that 40 percent of all existing home sales in 1980 were facilitated at least in part by shortterm balloontype loans in 1981 the figure was 60 percent in california where the wave of creative financing began the numbers are 37 percent in 1980 and 62 4 percent in 1981 translated into dollars and cents california observers estimate that this year shortterm loans worth a total of 498 million will come due but the worst is still to come the figures for 198386 have been estimated at 1 8 billion 2 2 billion 3 2 billion and 3 4 billion respectivelyin california alone obviously all of these numbers add up to big moneyand a lot of homeowners that must refinance in order to keep their homes at this point no one can conclusively say exactly what will happen when all of these loans come due however if the recession continues money remains tight and the unemployment rate stays high the situation is likely to explode and record numbers of people will start losing their homes one thing is certain balloon mortgages are just one more example of what high interest rates are doing to this country for it was the unavailability of affordable mortgage money that led the american home buyer to this financing technique and it will be high interest rates that cause people to lose their homes when the loans come due when american citizens start losing their homes as a result of a monetary policy it is time to abandon that policy the administrations policies are giving an increasing amount of credence to the old adage about the cure being worse than the illness the time for a new

saudi arabia itself did not use such data for malicious purposes it is not outside the realm of possibility that another nation or political entity could obtain such strategic information by

our countrys interests to meet the saudis request for offensive armament for the f15s already promised there are more constructive means to further our relationship with the riyadh regime than by

national security goals over thle next several years i believe we will find in our hanste to cut funding we have also cut back on numerous worthwvhile programs programs whose benefits more than outweigh the initial costs expended the conferees should be proud however for having had the fortitude to continue many of the statutory conservation and renewable programs which have tended to balance our energy program the appliance efficiency standards program the residential conservation service the residential commercial retrofit program will all continue due to the wvork of this conference the lowincome weatherization program will also continue funded at up to 175 million for fiscal year 1982 it is important to realize that the conferees intend that 175 million figure to hold only for the next fiscal year and that within the overall limits for state and local programs that figure can increase after that time the conferees have also provided clear instructions that the funding level under the economic regulatory administration will include sufficient funds to complete compliance activities activities estimated to result in the recapture of up to 10 billion in moneys overcharged the consumers of the nation i am particularly pleased that the conferees have agreed to increase the level for emergency prepardness from the 2 million originally proposed by the president to over 12 million this funding must be used efliciently and rigorously by the administration in order to prepare contingency plans so that the nation will be able to cope with future supply shortages or cutoffs we have also continued the energy information administration with clear instructions that statutorily mandated information systems including the financial reporting system be maintained the frs mandated under the doe organization act provides disaggregated data by major lines of business for energy companies includes activities of companies here and abroad and identifies investment activity within major lines of business according to the library of congress it is the only source of industry data using consistent definitions thus permitting comparisons to be made across companies and provides data sufficiently detailed to monitor competitiveness of the industry today in the light of growing attention to the financial activities of the major companies in the field of mergers

assist public participation in the development and enforcement of national energy programs by increasing the 168 000 requested by the administra ion for citizen participation programs to 240 000 thle current administration has expressed its reliance on the citizens of this nation in determining national policy and has repeatedly expressed its belief that the people should have more of a voice in determining the countrys future the increase in the citizen participation programn is a reflection of that feeling and as a conferee i would hope that the adinistration uses these funds to hear directly from our citizens how they believe our energy policy should be crafted and implemented the 240 000 is not intended to cover operating expenses for program direction for the office of consumer

decline in productivity growth i said then that congress had to focus its efforts on putting the puzzle together and launching a comprehensive strategy to improve productivity although productivity was at that time already a buzzword on capitol hill little was being done about it and the outlook was not encouraging unfortunately i am afraid the same can be said today there has been so much talk on the subject of productivity that perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves why prompt action in this area is so important as i see it there are at least four reasons why improved productivity must be a top priority for the federal government first and foremost i believe productivity is the neglected longterm key to our fight against inflation it is obvious that when the costs of labor raw materials and physical plant increase those higher costs will be translated entirely into higher prices for goods and servicesunless productivity is improved the second point is closely related low productivity growth is contributing to the weakening of the dollar by reducing the competitive edge of american products and thereby undermining the balance of trade third steady productivity growth is important to expanding employment here the relationship is perhaps less obvious and may contradict the assumption among rmany people that productivity simply means fewer people doing the same amount of work but as we should learn from the current discussions of supplyside economics more costeffective production is the key to business expansion and thus to expanded employment finally these benefits add up to a social or political argument for a strong productivity policy as we have progressed through successive antiinflation policies in the last few years americans have been asked repeatedly to make sacrifices i believe the country is willing to make those sacrifices but only if there is a visible and realistic path toward improvement ahead to date there has not been a comprehensive and coherent policy for improving productivity can provide that crucial glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when i addressed the house a year ago on this subject the economic report of the president for 1980 had just been released that report was rather fatalistic on the question of productivity since it is difficult to identify a single cause for a slowdown in productivity growth the report declared the immediate prospects for improvement in productivity are not good the attitude of mr carters council of economic advisors eventually improved the final economic report of president carter released in january abandons last years gloomy prognosis and asserts unequivocally that a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy intentions however have yet to be transformed into reality the sad fct is that there is no federal program to foster productivity improvement several federal activities scattered among various agencies and amounting to more than 2 billion do contribute to private sector productivity but the closest the federal government has come to establishing a productivity program which might coordinate these disparate activities and set clear productivity improvement goals is a deservedly obscure entity known as the national productivity council established by president carter under an executive order in october 1978 the record of that productivity council is a travesty upon its very name since 1978 the council has convened on exactly four occasions and has garnered a barely fulltime staff of two people with no funding last year i characterized the council as an interagency group which rarely meets and accomplishes little this year i am spared the embarrassment of repeating myself since the general accounting office in a thorough evaluation which has just been released has provided its own assessment the gao notes that the key responsibilities assigned by the president to the productivity council were first coordinating and supervising productivity activities throughout the federal government second identifying for the president and the congress key issues pertaining to productivity improvement and third serving as a focal point within the executive branch for productivity issues with special liaison to business labor and academic leaders on this subject the gao report concludes that the national productivity council has not effectively accomplished any of these functions in other words as a government and as a nation we have been wasting our timetime which we cannot afford to lose the councils inactivity has coincided with a 2year period of national productivity declineonly the secondand now the longestsuch period since world war ii the councils poor performance would be less discouraging if it were an isolated event unfortunately it is the fifth unsuccessful productivity group to be formed at the federal level in the past decade against that background of past failure i welcome president reagans determination to make a fresh start i am particularly pleased that the president has given productivity a high priority in his recent statements and i look forward to working with him toward that end i am today reintroducing legislation which i first offered a year ago which would create a statutory visible fully funded and fully staffed national productivity council this proposed council is fashioned upon recommendations of the general accounting office and i believe it can succeed where its forerunners have failed this council would be assigned specific and important responsibilities which the gao has concluded on the basis of its past experience will be essential to a successful federal productivity effort these responsibilities will include first the formulation and annual revision of a national productivity improvement plan second analysis of those federal activities which hinder or encourage improved productivity in the private sector third legislative and regulatory recommendatiods to the congress for enhanced productivity fourth consultation with representatives of business labor and academic institutions on the subject of productivity improvement and fifth coordination of various federal activities related to productivity why do we need this council above all because when we have 2 billion worth of independently evolved programs affecting productivity we need to have some coordination of them we need to analyze the effectiveness of our total effort to assess where the gaps are in that effort and to discover what more could be done for example in its recent report the gao found that current federal expenditures in the area of productivity were not evenly distributed among activities related to productivity less than 2 percent is spent for improving human resources through programs for skill training hiproved labor mobility job security and labormanagement cooperation the report found i believe that an active forceful and respected national productivity council could help to redress such imbalances by calling them to our attention and by suggesting corrective measures the council could similarly restore a balanced perspective to the current obsession with business investment as the total cure for lagging productivity certainly increased capital formation is an important component of any effort to improve productivity but investment alone is not the answera fact which we are in danger of forgettiog today we are poised on the brink of accepting a multibilliondollar tax cut for accelerated business depreciation which has been promoted as a panacea for declining productivity growth yet as even business weeks analyses have shown the capital cost recovery act has a highly differentiated effect on various industrial sectorssome benefit greatly others benefit very little as we well know there is already a considerable range of productivity growth rates within the private sector the proposed tax benefits of the 1053 legislation do not always correspond to the sectors in need as pat choate and gail schwartz point out in a recent book on sectoral revitalization we need to know whether acrosstheboard tax incentives would encourage the flow of capital into those vital industries that need it the most in order to modernize and ultimately become more productive the historical precedents would suggest the opposite faced with such crucial policy dilemmas i am convinced the existence of a professional national productivity council could be extremely helpful we need a neutral third party whose sole concern is the federal impact on productivity and to whom we can turn for reliable advice in short we need an unrelenting spokesman who will keep the issue of productivity uppermost in our minds and make us aware of how federal policies affect it there is of course considerable hostility today toward any proposal to create a new government organization not surprisingly some of that antagonism was directed last year toward my proposal for a new productivity council let me assure those critics that i share their skepticism and their concern about government bureaucracy moreover i fully acknowledge that the crucial decisions affecting productivity growth will be made in the private sector nevertheless we must face the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that a federal government which spends more than 22 percent of gross national product and whose taxing and regulatory policies broadly affect the private economy ought to have some agency within it that attends to the nations no 1 economic problem governments of other industrialized nations such as japan and west germany are much more involved with labor and business in developing a consensus policy for maintaining high productivity growth we would do well to take our cue from their success my proposal for a statutory productivity council would not add to the burden of government but rather would respond to a serious weakness in governmental performance as the recent gao report noted all key economic decisionmakers in recent years have recognized the importance of productivity growth to our economic strength yet when economic policies are made productivity concerns seem to be given low priority the new productivity council would not be an economic deci sionmaker but would participate in economic and budgetary decisionmaking to ensure the presence of a productivity perspective naturally some members will not be persuaded that spending 5 million on a productivity council to oversee 2 billion in current productivity programs is a worthwhile investment to these colleagues let me offer a more compelling costbenefit analysis as a 1978 report of the council on wage and price stability observed the effect of slow productivity growth since 1967 has been to reduce total real incomes by some 20 percentmore than 300 billionfrom what they would have been if the pre1967 productivity growth rate had been sustained clearly we cannot afford not to invest in a more productive future last summer the retiring chairman of the house subcommittee on economic stabilization scheduled 4 days of hearingswhich i chairedon the problem of lagging productivity growth and what the federal government should do about it in my opinion those hearings were very useful in sharpening our understanding of this issue in particular they reinforced my conviction that something like a statutory productivity council is needed in the executive branch i would like to take a few moments to share with my colleagues some highlights from those hearings which in my view strengthen the case for the legislation which i am reintroducing today during the initial hearing testimony was given by an associate director of the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the current productivity council ombs presentation revealed a startling devaluation of the productivity problem high inflation and energy problems which dominated the 1970s omb testified must be solved before the productivity growth rate can be restored to its previous level when during quistioning of the witnesses i suggested that this statement reflected a disturbingly passive approach to the productivity issue 0mb simply reaffirmed its view that productivity growth will result when the economic policiesof the administrationtake hold this determination to put the cart before the horse says a good deal about why the existing productivity council has been such an abysmal failure most experts in this field i think would agree that lagging productivity growth is a major component of inflation rather than the other way around no productivity council worthy of the name can succeed when it is a captive of ombs perspective on this point one of our subsequent witnesses economist lester thurow from the massachusetts institute of technology saw the issue much more clearly productivity is obviously the countrys number one problem when productivity is going downhill it doesnt make any difference what is happening to inflation or enemployment you are going to have an economy thats going downhill although the public opinion polls havent put productiv ity in the number one slot 1 think the congress ought to put it in the number one slot at one point in the discussion i asked mr thurow whether he thought the united states would benefit from some kind of independent group that might be perceived as a little less partisanthan the congresssuch as a national economic commission or a national productivity council professor thurow largely concurred i certainly think there is a lot of value in information especially in the productivity area productivity is one of those kind of background things whiph doesnt make the headlines well we are not going to address the productivity problem until the american people in fact decide that it is an important problem that they have to address one of the traditional barriers to productivity efforts on a national level has been the opposition from many sectors of the labor movement which feared from past experiences that productivity was just another name for speedup or reduced labor force thus some of the most instructive and encouraging testimony received by our subcommittee came from mr donald ephlin a vice president of the united auto workers in his opening statement mr ephlin underscored his own unions willingness to tackle a tough issue we recognize that the only reliable basis for improving the purchasing power and access to leisure of american workers is the increase in the economys capacity to convert a given amount and intensity of work into ever more output in keeping with that recognition the uaw has explicity pledged not to oppose the introduction of productivityenhancing laborsaving technological advances on the specific subject of my legislation to create a statutory productivity council mr ephlin observed that the uaw is in strong support of objectives mr ephlin went on to make a crucial point with respect to a productivity councils potential effectiveness the national productivity improvement plan that the council is directed to develop will not be regarded as authoritative and viable unless it incorporates the agenda of labor and business by including them in the proposed council a tripartite committee would be created the parties would have the opportunity and the responsibility to find a common ground between often conflicting sets of goals as a public official who has been involved in the labormanagement cooperation movement for many years i have seen what it can achieve in the area of productivity and i wholeheartedly agree with mr ephlins tripartite proposal the legislation i am introducing today does create an advisory board to the productivity council whose members are to be selected entirely from individuals with experience in business labor and academics the bill does not take the further step of placing such individuals on the council itself but i am quite open to that possibility and will be exploring that alternative structure in the weeks ahead appearing on the same panel with mr ephin dr richard rahn vice president of the unitedstates chamber of commerce endorsed the same notion of tripartite communication among business labor and government but added i dont think there is a need for a formal government intervention in this process fortunately not all of the probusiness community seems to feel the same hesitation for example the american enterprise institutes committee to fight inflation chaired by former federal reserve board chairman arthur burns recently issued a ninepoint antiinflation plan i was pleased to note that in one of those points the committee urged congress and the president to actively encourage labormanagement councils in individual shops offices and stores throughout the country so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity perhaps the most persuasive testimony from any witness last summer was the presentation from the american productivity center this private nonprofit organization based in houston tex has done pioneering work with numerous businesses to improve productivity the organization is chaired by c jackson grayson former head of southern methodist universitys business school and was represented at last summers hearings by one of its directors mr william usery former secretary of labor mr usery had this to say on the productivity council legislation which i am sponsoring although i and the american productivity center believe that h r 6462 may not go far enough in its particulars we believe it is a most important step toward a firm commitment by our government to improve productivity efforts within the private sector have proved successful but are limited by the relative absence of government commitment to implementing solutions one might expect a private organization like the american productivity center to dismiss a government productivity group as intrusive and unnecessary on the contrary however mr usery explained in some detail the benefits which the center anticipates would result from a federally formulated productivity improvement plan the federal government would be helping to bring together elements of the business labor and government communities such a friendly meeting of the minds would be beneficial to america and certainly beneficial to productivity the concept of a national productivity policy has many advantages over other economic measures we have already tried other measures such as cutbacks controls regulation spending subsidies protectionism the result has been in most cases a failure a successful productivity program promises to avoid the problems inherent in these other actions no one expects that a national pro ductivity council by itself will reverse the deceleration in americas productivity growth productivity is an enormously complex issueone which must be addressed simultaneously on several fronts certainly the diverse testimony we heard last summer confirmed that point but paradoxically a productivity council might help us make some progress by reminding us of that very complexityby insuring that congress does not attempt to solve our productivity problems by seizing upon on simplistic cure in my statement on productivity a year ago i outlined four general areas each encompassing several policy issues where i thought our efforts could be profitably focused first improving the use of human resources second enhancing capital formation third expanding the commercialization of advances in knowledge innovation and fourth reforming the regulatory process i can only look back over those remarks today with acute frustration if a national productivity council were monitoring congressional progress in these areas we would not receive high marks for achievement during the past year in the absence of that kind of thirdparty neutral assessment let me take my remaining time this afternoon to list some of the legislative objectives which remain unfulfilled i will not take time as i did last year to discuss these measurses relevance to productivity but i do believe each item forms a part of the puzzle"],

or something like that and if the president could invoke then the law mandated by the congress in cutting off economic aid i would point out that the administration previously cut off 45 000 metric tons of wheat and food to that country and that is not covered by any congressional restrictions relatini to an arms flow to el salvador so they just cut off the food aid and the wheat that goes to make the bread the aid that helps to feed the poor people in nicaragua is cut off prior to any determination ever being made that there were arms flowing again it points to one thing that there are elements in this administration that are geared up to create economic chaos in nicaragua nicaragua we must understand is one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere after the civil war their entire economy was wrecked over 80 percent of all the small businesses in that country were wrecked by bombing over 60 percent of their manufacturing process was completely destroyed in that civil war and that war just ended not quite 2 years ago the somoza government and the somocistas who left took all the money with them and left the country with 3 million in their entire bank account and with a debt of over 1 5 billion in meeting with father cardinale this morning and in talking about this cutoff of food aid and this cutoff of economic aid to nicaragua at this time he said something which i think the members ought to hear it was an analogy that i think really strikes home he said its one thing to beat up on a healthy person but he said it is quite another thing to kick an invalid who is lying in a hospital bed and that is really what we are doing to nicaragua now they are an invalid lying in a hospital bed and we are kicking them while they are down i would say again that in the view of many what we are doing is really carrying out what the heritage foundation report said and again i would quote it for the members the report stated discontented nicaraguans could be aided in an armed strugle against the sandinistas by the former national guardsmen now in exile again i want to report to the members that the head of that foundation that issued that report is now the head of our national security council richard allen well i submit that this administrations recent cutoff of this economic aid and food aid in an effort to as they say stem this flow of armswhich has never been proven and which all of our european allies laughed at when as i understand it this administration went over to show them this hard evidence they hadis no more than the first step in this destabilization process the same destabilization process that our cia engaged in the dominican republic in guatemala and in chile i feel that as was quoted in the post this morning senator helms and generalissimo haig would like nothing better than a failure of the sandinista governments efforts to keep private industry going in their country they would like nothing better than for this effort to fail this administration right now is cutting assistance that we earmarked for the private sector of that country because it wants i believe the economy to worsen and ordinary nicaraguan citizens to suffer because if they suffer then they will begin to turn against their own government this i believe is the explanation that we can find for the ban on assistance after nicaragua complied with what the state department said it had to comply with and that is the cutting off of the supposed arms shipments to el salvador now they have said that perhaps the food aid could be started in 2 or 3 weeks how many people will starve how many people will suffer how many children will become malnourished in the meantime because we have cut off that food aid to nicaragua and then they said they are leaving the door open for the resumption of economic aid later on when when april 2 1 981 i1 1288 the conditions become even worse when more national guardsmen cross that border from honduras to nicaragua to create more economic and political instability in that country i submit that they want to reinstitute the economic aid and food aid to nicaragua only after that government is overthrown only after they can dictate to that country what kind of a government they ought to have and only after we make sure that we put that government in power the united states i am sorry to say has a long and ugly history of destabilizing governments in our southern part of the western hemisphere as i said earlier our cia helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in the dominican republic in guatemala and in chile and in spite of much of the puff and roar in this administration about cuba and the soviet union destabilizing existing governments in the third world it looks like our own state department and the cia are at it again themselves as they were some years ago i just hope that the members of this body will understand and look at this situation i know that nicaragua is a small country just as el salvador is i know that in the global conflict between the east and the west they matter for little but in terms of what we are about as a nation in terms of our own revolutionary background and in terms of what we believe insocial justice and economic justice for the underprivileged and for the impoverished of the world those basic human qualities on which i think all of us can agree whether we are conservatives liberals republicans or democratson that basis we ought to pay more attention to what is happening in nicaragua and what is happening in el salvador and what is happening throughout central america they are indeed our cousins they are indeed our brothers and sisters in this western hemisphere and if we turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to what is happening to the poor and what is happening to the people who have suffered for centuries under oligarchical dictatorships in those countries then i fear for what we will become ourselves as a

orders from moscow niklus received an illefsal and undeserved sentence of ten years in a special regime labor camp plus five years of internal exile from the estonian supreme court in tallinn on january 8 1981 this is essentially a disguised death sentence because our government frars dissidents and does not discriminate in choosing weapons against them in making this decision the supreme court declared that mart niklus is a repeat offender who is extremely dangerous to the soviet regime because of the following accusations l mart niklus interpreta the 1975 relsinki accords in his own way and acts in an antisoviet manner 2 he uses his knowledge of foreign languages to listen to foreign broadcasts and communicate with foreigners by telephone and mall 3 his friend and sympathizer has been academician andrei sakharov even before dr sakharov was exiled to gorky 4 his favorite authors are alexander solz henitsyn and the worldfamous scholar nikolai vavilov who was brutally and illegally executed in 1943 in saratov by the nkvd secret police now called the kob and was posthumously rehabilitated 5 he dared sign his name to the baltic appeal which demanded that the independence of the baltic states be restored by nullifying the molotovribbentrop pact and removing russian troops and the russian administration from estonia 6 he dared write a protest on the occasion of the soviet occupation of afghanistan and to send it to moscow 7 he favored a boycott of the moscow olympics 8 all this conforms mart nikluss irreconcilable incompatibility with moscows occupation of estonia he discussed his opinion with compatriots and influenced them to have antisoviet sentiments which result in unpleasant disturbances against the prevailing order on january 26 niklus was sent in poor health on a long trip from tallinn through leningrad to the east when we asked the transit commander if mart could be left behind this time because of his illness and be placed in an interim hospital for treatment the commander told us he could make no changes consequently niklus exhausted from illness and his hunger strike was stuffed into a railroad car his condition became so serious on the way that in the beginning of february he was hospitalized in leningrad the news came from mart that on february 10 he had been in sverdlovsk from there he started being shuffled back and forth by railroad without any sort of medical attention or help between camps 36 and 35 between perm and tyumen he was threatened with being sent further and further away until he dies by himself none of the camps in this area want to accept a sick person and certainly not a person that has to be put in the hospital for treatment on february 12 the commander of the specialregime labor camp in perm notified that mart niklus had reached his destination perm labor camp no 36 on march 17 mart niklus wrote about the lack of medical treatment and about his generally ill feeling because of his continuing hunger strike he asked everyone who learns of his situation to appeal to world public opinion to rebuke the executioners and reveal the disguised death sentences that they have given to unfortunate and helpless prisoners this is important because here in our country no lawyer no appeal will sway those programmed by moscow who is not with us we will destroy we will not kill them but

it is my understanding that an agency may place employees on administrative leave or excused absence for short periods of time when i has been forced to shut down in whole or in part for emergency or management reaspns in this case the boards furlough was forced by its efforts to maintain a minimal level of operations when there were no assurances that a supplemental appropriation would be approved and signed thus allowing the necessary funds for fulltime operations it seems to me that the board took the only reasonable course available to it under the circumstances when it furloughed its employees instead of spending ahead as if everything was a certainty they attempted to stretch out their remaining funds in case there was no urgent supplemental it would be unfair to penalize the employees because of the failure of congress to pass the necessary legislation to allow the board to operate atfull scale i consider the boards action to be responsible management and in my opinion once the urgent supplemental is passed and available to the board the furlough should be treated as a situation justifying administrative leave or excused absence so that employees can be justly

well they did not know exactly but they knew that they needed an intratheater capability and so we asked them to give us a little more detail and would they please be a little more particular in describing the need what is the need well they said that they had the c5 but they wanted an intratheater capability that once the goods got there whether it be by surface transportation or otherwise

found out what it was that we had bought not only was there a 2 billion overrun which the air force denied and denied and finally admitted parenthetically and ironically in the whole fiasco of the original c5 overrun when lockheed was saying well there is no overrun and the air force was saying well there is no overrun and then they finally admitted well yes there is a 2 billion overrunthe only

compliment my good friend from massachusetts for his statement that had he had an opportunity to participate in the preparation of this bill that he would have included this money for the coast guard

well aware of the crisis the social security system is facing indeed between use of social security as a political issue in this falls campaigns and anticipation of the longawaited report of the presidents commission on social security reform it has been impossible to forget about social security for long there is certainly no doubt that the fiscal crisis which has been predicted so many times is actually upon us as you know the retirement fund has had to borrow from the disability and medicare trust funds in order to send out its november and december benefit checks on time interfund borrowing is giving us the time we need to search for a solution but it is no substitute for comprehensive reform the newspapers have also told us that many young people are losing faith in the ability of the system to pay out benefits into the longterm future i believe this demonstrates a lack of confidence not just in social security but in the ability and the willingness of congress and the administration to deal with this issue in any substantive meaningful way it is essential not only for financial reasons but also to restore public faith that congress demonstrate the political courage to deal with this difficult problem we have heard a good many suggestions in recent months as to how best to solve social securitys problems but most of the proposals have this in common they are shortterm remedial measures designed to make up the systems immediate shortfall but to do little else most ould place heavy burdens on workers or retirees or both we must protect the current and future retirees who have paid into the system for many years cuts in benefits would cause especially severe hardships for the twothirds of recipients whose social security benefits are their sole or primary source of income likewise proposals to accelerate the scheduled increases in the payroll tax would have a severe impact on the young workers of today without guaranteeing that the system would still be available when they retire i believe we should view the current situation not only as a crisis to be solved but as an opportunity for major structural reform which will secure the retirement fund well into the future the social security system was established originally to pay pensions to retired workers and their dependents and to provide for their families in case of death americans now count on social security for many different kinds of assistance but i think most would agree that its primary purpose should remain the payment of retirement and related benefits if social security is to survive its current crisis and if the american people are to continue to believe in its future the system must be retuthed to this original conception i am today introducing legislation which will not only remedy social securitys shortterm financial difficulties but will also reform the system to insure its longterm fiscal integrity the basic thrust of this legislation is to provide for a gradual transition to do the following stabilize the retirement insurance program in its current form through the payroll tax and separate out the other major components of the social security systemdisability insurance and hospital insuranceby taking them off the payroll tax and onto a permanent trust fund supported by the general fund specifically this bill maintains the oldage and survivors insurance trust fund for the payment of retirement survivors and dependents benefits oasi will still be funded by the payroll tax but will have a separate account in the federal budget disability and medicare will be consolidated into one trust fund which will draw revenues out of the general fund oasi will be credited with whatever surplus remains in the disability and hospital trust funds and the amounts already transferred under the interfund borrowing program will not need to be repaid over a transition period covering the years 198390 the oasi trust fund will receive an amount of the payroll tax decreasing from 5 275 percent in 1983 to 5 2 percent in 1984 and 5 1 percent from 1985 on even under worstcase economic assumptions this tax schedule will build up a sufficient level of reserves to insure continued payment of retirement and retirementrelated benefits through the 1980s demographic trends in the 1990s are expected to favor social security meaning that the retirement program will be stabilized well into the 21st century immediate payment of disability and medicare benefits out of the general fund would obviously place a tremendous strain on an already overloaded federal budget next years budget deficit is projected to reach 200 billion and i do not think we can sanction any measure which would add substantial amounts to that staggering figure my legislation includes several provisions which will insure that during the transition period the federal budget deficit will not be adversely affected by the addition of disability and medicare benefits first over the 198390 transition period a specified amount of the payroll tax will be paid into the consolidated disability and health insurance trust fund to be used toward the pay ment of disability and medicare benefits this amount will increase from 1 425 percent in 1983 to 1 5 percent in 1984 1 95 percent in 198586 and 2 05 percent in 198790 under this system the total payroll tax will rise from its current 6 7 to 7 05 percent in 1985 and 7 15 percent in 198790 however the payroll tax is scheduled under current law to reach 7 05 percent in 1985 7 15 percent in 1986 and 7 65 percent in 1990greater increases than those contained in this legislation second in addition the projected 10percent tax cut due to be implemented on july 1 1983 would be reduced to 5 percent with theremaining 5percent setaside during the period 198390 into the consolidated trust fund i think it is important to point out here that the payroll tax is a regressive tax because it is a flat percentage taking a proportionately greater share out of the low or middleincome workers paycheck the income tax system on the other hand is designed to be progressive the h ther ones income the greater the ta rate use of an income tax base instead of the payroll tax thus spreads the burden of disability and medicare costs more fairly while the combined revenues from the special payroll tax and the income tax setaside will result in an increase in federal outlays in some years and a surplus in others the overall effects of revenues and outlays over the transition period will more or less offset each other current figures indicate that by 1990 this proposal will actually result in a net addition to the federal budget of 1 5 billiori finally this bill includes two additional reforms which i feel are important in the effort to insure longterm stability first social security ccverage will be extended to employees of nonprofit organizations federal employees who do not already have vested pension rights in the civil service or other federal retirement system and new federal hires this approach meets two consid erations it moves the system toward the universal coverage which was intended by its founders and it protects those federal employees who have paid into their own retirement systems in good faith and are already receiving or can expect to receive returns on those contributions second costofliving adjustments will be indexed to the annual increase in wages minus 1 percentage pointsthe average annual increase in productivityrather than to the consumer price index use of the wage index will stabilize the system by subjecting its beneficiaries to the same economic conditions as its working contributors the advantages of this legislation over other proposals currently under consideration are significant it does not cut benefits to current retirees or significantly restructure the benefits to be paid to future retirees it does not accelerate payroll tax increases indeed it scales those increases back and from 1991 on the new retirement fund is projected to remain stable with a 5 1percent tax rate with regard to medicare and disability i have long felt that these programs are better suited for general revenue financing than for funding through the payroll tax these are both extremely valuable and worthwhile programs and i certainly do not intend the federal governments commitment to the ill and the disabled to be weakened in any way however it is difficult to reconcile these programs with the earned wage benefit conception on which the retirement program was founded because unlike retirement these programs do not pay benefits to everyone who pays social security taxes use of a flat percentage payroll tax on all workers is appropriate for a retirement insurance program which pays benefits to all workers but insurance against disability and illness is best funded from other sourcep it simply is not equitable to ask low and middleincome workers who may never receive benefits from these programs to bear a greater share of their costs through a regressive payroll tax the measures currently under consideration by the commission constitute bandaid approaches to the social security systems problems they may succeed in patching up the shortterm financial crisis but they cannot be presented to the american people as a comprehensive solution i believe americans are willing to sacrifice in order to help insure the systems stability but at the same time they expect and deserve a responsible and humane approach to the systems problems this proposal provides such an approach it stabilizes the retirement program for all workers without asking any one sector to bear too heavy a share of the burden of change and it transfers the components of the system which are not available to all workers to general revenue financing i urge my colleagues to use this opportunity to institute this comprehensive and muchneeded

alternative budget in march which not only balanced the budget but provided for a surplus as well while providing for growth in the budget for our nations defense needs its outlay reductions equaled

proposal during consideration of the budget and i regret that but i am grateful that other votes which are in order will give us the opportunity to respond in a positive and responsible manner to the american people by voting for a balanced budget the importance of a balanced budget has been demonstrated by economists such as dr otto eckstein president of data resources inc in response to my inquiry he said in the current context of high inflation excessive government borrowing and insufficent private capital formation a balanced budget or a surplus budget would be highly desirable the traditional fiscal policy reasoning that too sharp a swing in the budget could trigger a recession has little applicability in the current context the private economy has an abundance of inherent strength and it is only the necessity to limit money supply mrowth which is creating the high interest rates that are holding back the total private advance if the federal government borrowed less and pumped less purchasing power into private hands monotary policy would not have to be so stringent and could allow creditfinancing private spending suich as houising to proceed in stonger fashion thus the general thrust of your proposals is correct and would be beneficial to the economy mr eckstein also added that this focuses on an important issue wvhich is being lost in the current debate between the administration and the democratic leadership in congress would not the economy be better off if the budget really were balanced would not the benefit of lower interest rates made possible by that approach have just as good or better repercussions for capital formation employment and inflation fighting than all of the new supply side rhetoric and old trickledown theory we hear these days after all in response to my questioning the chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker told the ways and means committee thhtt the objective for this congress must be to have a realistic program to balance the budget yet the administration continues to promote tax cuts and deficit spending a family of four earning 20 000 will get an annual tax cut of about 294 or 24 per month under the reagan proposal this money will be insignificant to average taxpayers as they continue their struggle with rising costs and spiraling inflation a 10percent individual tax cut will be swallowed up in the tidal wave of inflation and our economy may not weather the storm president reagan proposes to borrow money to pay for the tax cut and put the budget in deficit to the tune of 60 billion in fiscal year 1982 this is clearly inflationary my colleagues mr gramm and mr latta have a proposal which has been called bipartisan but what could be more bipartisan than a balanced budget as mr latta said in

have that opportunity once again but the htfiportance of this issue should not be lost in partisan rhetoric fiscal responsibility is not unique to any party we all realize the importance of fighting
