standard of human rights and human dignity which every nation should accord itscitizens today 33 years later that goal has not been reached more distressing to us as american citizenff the commitinent of the united states to a human rights policy and world implementationi of the universal declaration of human rights has not been consistent president jimmy carter took the world by surprise when he stressed unitedstates concern for international human rights as a major goal of our foreign policy by contrast president ronald reagan is less concerned with the internal policies of other nations as a criterion for our assistance which has caused lament among human rights advocates who see a major shift in the unitedstates position however it is important to remember that it was congress not carter which initiated the unitedstates human rights policy of the 1970s now that the administration has deemphasized this issue it is up to congress to take the leadership again and reassert the need for a strong human rights policy which can serve our national interests and promote international peace and stability international human rights first became a priority for congress at the same time it took a more active role in foreign policy during the postvietnam war era with the war over remnants of the antiwar movement turned their attention to the roots of that conflict and pushed for a tighter control on our involvement with repressive foreign policy governments beginning in 1973 congress passed a series of progressively tougher provisions banning unitedstates assistance to foreign nations engaged in human rights violations and it also required annual reports onl the human rights practices of other nations in 1976 congress passed a sweeping bill that would have established a mandatory cutoff of security asssistance to human rights violators but it was vetoed by president gerald ford by 1977 when carter proclaimed in his first inaugural address that our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights congress had already set the basic framework of the unitedstates human rights policy during the carter administration congress worked with the president to implement that policy legislation established the position of assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs first held by patricia derian her name and actions became well known and appreciated worldwide by victims of oppression from dissidents in argentina to refuseniks in the soviet union working with the interagency committee on human rights and foreign assistance informally chaired by d puty secretary of state warren christopher derian insured that human rights was a factor to be considered on foreign policy decisions as the focus on human rights shifted from congress to carter and expanded in scope criticism also mounted carter officials were challenged by those who believed that unitedstates concern about the humane treatment of foreign citizens by their own governmients operates against unitedstates security interests however the dichotomy between these national priorities is artificial international human rights considcrations in reality are an essential element of our own longterm strategic goals cozy relations with repressive foreign governments can ultimately hurt more than help recent experience demonstrates that victims of repressive governments are not quick to forget unitedstates identification with their former leaders for example our uncritical support pf the authoritarian regime of iranian shah mohammed reza pahlavi alienated us from the iranian people with devastating results when the shah was overthrown likewise our close ties

milliona cost which eventually must be paid by downtown employees shoppers and visitors in the form of rapidly escalating parking fees just as important is the fact that downtown streets and freeways

first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 directed our committee to achieve certain savings in both its authorization and direct spending programs we more than met the level of savings recommended in the reconciliation instructions in fact the committee in a strong bipartisan approach responded to the dollar targets set in the conference report by submitting recommendations containing 28 million of added savings in budgetary authority and over 400 million in outlays in accordance with budget committee guidelines the committee recommended no specific legislative changes for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 since reductions assumed by the budget resolution of the out years were for programs not presently authorized beyond fiscal year 1982 however the committee clearly and strongly expressed its commitment to achieve the recommended out year reductions when its programs come up for reauthorization in exceeding the aggregate savings directed by the budget resolution our committee complied with both the letter and the spirit of the savings directives it received while at the same time recognizing the expertise of the committee to make the necessary decisions on any programmatic changes i might say at this point that savings achieved by the public works and transportation committee in its recommendations to the budget committee were not reached without substantial discussion and some hard decisions on highly significant programs of great impact throughout the nation in making the necessary decisions on these programs our committee sought and

figure substantially below the 789 million set by the congressional budget office even as we make the necessary decisions to reduce funding for aviation programs we must continue to protect our valuable capital investment in airports and air traffic control systems if we expect to meet projected increases in air traffic growth likewise the nations capital investment in its highway and public transit systems so essential to any plans for industrial revitalization must continue to receive high priorities in its recommendations to the budget committee our committee put an 8 2 million limitation for fiscal year 1982 on obligations for federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs excluding those for emergency relief and three emergency bridge projects consequently outlays for the federalaid highway program would be reduced by 500 million as compared to the budget resolution assumption of only 185 million in outlay savings in the area of highway safety the

on highway safety programs in the next fiscal year budget authority for public mass transportation was reduced by the committee from that provided in the urban mass transportation act to levels

taxes and the growth of the federal budget and establish sound monetary policy although these goals are worthwhile and have my support i have doubts that these objectives can be met if national decisionmaking assumes that all states have the same economic problems and needs as an economic program takes hold the older industrialized states of the north and the expanding states of the south and west will simply not be starting from the same position my concern is that the northeastmidwest regions relative position will continue to decline if the disparities among regions are ignored if we assume that growth will affect all regions equally we run the risk of shaping an economic program which contributes to the decline of some areas of the country while favoring others variations

foundations for these regional expansions would not have occurred t he resulting effect has been a flow of federal dollars from the northeast and midwest to the south and west between 1975 and 1979 the older industrial states of the north paid 165 billion more in taxes to the federal government than was returned in spending while the south and west enjoyed a 112 billion surplus over their

proposals which will be offered as substitutes will return hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenues back to the american people returning money to the taxpayers is a noble goal and one which i enthusiastically support however i cannot and will not support a measure which returns hundreds of billions of dollars to the taxpayers in a haphazard and sometimes irresponsible manner the ways and means committee bill is being presented as an alternative to the presidents original tax proposaland to the bipartisan substitutewhen in fact it is not an alternative tax policy at all the bill is more properly described as a political document and a classic example of political horse trading logrolling and halfeffective tax symbolism the ways and means committee took the sound comprehensive economic policy inherent in the presidents 51010 acrs tax program and turned it into a highly ornamented christmas tree the glitter and attractive ornaments got the attention but very little consideration was given to the basic economic foundation bailing out certain socalled distressed industries would be far less objectionable if the rest of our industrial base had already been made healthy and productive through economic stimulus providing increases in the negative income tax we call the earned income credit might be more accepti ble if it did not involve increasing the taxes of the millions of already overburdened taxpayers who are forced to subsidize this benefit unfortunately the majority members of the ways and means committee must have lost sight of the original goals behind this tax bill and instead reported a political document which they hoped could prevail they were forced to bend their bill toward the presidents proposal for the same reason nonetheless their bills ultimate value to the economy is highly questionable some of the provisions in the bill reflect the committee attitude of finding an alternative proposal at any cost one of the other chief offenders in the bill is the committees depreciation proposal which was hastily dreamed up and tossed into the bill as a means of finding an alternative to the acr5 program that the president had proposed the acr8 1053 proposal had been the subject of intense scrutiny over the past few years by some of the finest economic and financial minds in the country it had been drafted and redrafted until a final proposal was developed which most experts agreed would provide almost all of the incentives necessary to rebuild our industrial base and return life and vigor to the economy instead of taking the advice of almost all of the witnesses that teatified before the committee in favor of the acrs concept the ways and means bill relies on a new and untested expensing proposal it is not a bad idea but this proposal is so untried that its provisions were changed almost every time the committee sat down to mark up the bill because it is so untested it is difficult to find anybody in industry that can testify as to how it will affect various industries and regions sometimes i think that the president should have offered the text of the committee bill as his original proposal that way in its quest for an alternative tax program the ways and means committee might then have passed a bill like conablehance as its own bill the country would then be able to look forward to the next decade as an era of sound economic and tax policy instead of approaching the coming years with trepidation as to what lies ahead for the health and stability of our entire economy there is a good deal more to distinguish the presidentially endorsed bipartisan conablehance amendment from the ways and means committee bill than a third year of individual tax cuts the permanentization of those cuts or a skewing of the cuts but those are the major differences that have dominated all the discussions on thisdebate i believe the conablehance alternative is superior specifically because it preserves the third year of tax cuts and then perpetuates them through indexing it provides a real tax cut over 3 years the committee bill because of bracket creep and social security will acutally cause taxpayers to pay more taxes after 3 years than they pay today it is not a tax cut at all we have been told that the conablehance amendment favors the rich the democratic party line alleges the committee bill is better for people with 50 000 of income or less i will readily admit that the committee tax cuts are skewed they are not acrosstheboard cuts which i favor and most of america favors but how much do they favor middleincome people under the committee bill a 15 000 wage earner with a family of four will do better in the first year 1982 by less than 2 a month the 20 000 earner with the same family situation by less than 3 a month when income rises over 35 000 for this kind of taxpayer the conablehance amendment will be more favorable even after 2 years so much for generosity our thimbles runneth over more important than the fact that the income level skewing is minimal is the fact that everybody comes out better under the conablehance bill in the third year as the president has said the committee bill is better only for those who plan to live only 2 years so if any member of this body has been planning to vote for the committee bill because it is so much better for middleincome people he or she can now safely change their plans the presidents plan is better the few pennies a month that it delivers represent an insignificant difference from the straightforward and fair acrosstheboard tax cuts of conable hance however if members are curious as to where the committee version puts the money that it admittedly takes away from higher income taxpayers let them be aware that the democrat bill sweetens the earned income tax credit by nearly 2 billion over the first 3 years the members may recall the earned income tax credit goes to people who pay almost nothing to begin with or who are not even taxpayers at all if we want to help people who pay no taxes at the expense of those who pay most of this countrys tax bills we probably should support the committees tax bill some members may like the 3 billion given to the largest companies in america under the bailey bailout if we vote for the committee bill we can deny our constituents a third year of the tax cut and give the money instead to such distressed companies as general motors ford international paper united states steel southern railroad standard of ohio and scads of other large profitable companies the members own taxpayer constituents will be interested to hear why we reduced their tax cut to give to the largest and most powerful corporations of this country and if some members still like the committee bill i invite them to consider how we are going to explain to our constituents that we are only cutting their taxes by 15 percent but we are cutting the maximum trx rate for exxon and ibm and other giants by nearly 30 percent those are some of the reasons to vote against the committee bill there are plenty of additional reasons to vote in favor of the coneblehance bipartisan substitute a number of members have stood in this well and told us that the committee bill is better for the small business remember that the largest small business organization in the world strongly and unequivocably supports the conablehance amendment remember too that the cuts in conablehance are real and they are permanent the bill is fair the cuts are made across the board they effectively provides stimulus to those healthy growing companies in our industrial system on which we are going to have to depend conablehance does not bail out the cripples it helps those who are going to provide us new jobs in the future the bipartisan subsitute presidents total economic program the final and perhaps most dominant reason of al to support it is that our constituents want us to vote for this bill the telephones in our offices have been jammed with calls since the presidents speech average americans are calling and telling us that we ought to be supporting the president they know his tax cut fits the presidents comprehensive economic programn now that we have adopted our tight budget and supported it by the reconciliation a vote for the conablehance amendment is the next step we

cleancut expression of what he prefers but moreover you are denying the american people a vote they want to move more swiftly and assuredly to a balanced budget in this is no procedural vote as the gentleman from mississippi said it is a substantive vote a 20 billion vote as a matter of fact i might remind some of my friends that when we helped orchestrate the component parts of the first concurrent resolution in the form of grammnlatta i there were those whose price for support was deeper cuts to the tune of 5 billion to give you a smaller deficit in 1982 that was done to accommodate our friends who we felt at the time were very serious about joining us in this fight to significantly cut federal spending get us to a balanced budget more quickly and chart a significant change of direction for our country in my windup remarks on that first concurrent budget resolution i referred to that vote as a relatively easy one i think i used the words it is a cake walk and the tougher ones were yet to come i guess to include the golfing analogy one more time you drive for show and putt for dough that first concurrent budget resolution was one all for show and this is the one for real dough 20 billion of it this is not only a bad rule it is a rotten rule it is what you would expect to cram down the throats of a party of nincompoops it offends every single member on my side of the aisle and i know it has to offend the sensibilities of a good many on the speakers side who feel that the gentleman stretched this one out just a bit too far i might say further we might as well find out today whether there is or is not a formal philosophical coalition is it there or is it not the country cries out for it give us a chance to implement what we voted for they say we ask our friends on the democratic side of the aisle to again join us in this effort ii 3381 i need not tell the members what the longrange implications are of this very critical vote today those members with a good sense of fair play should be just as incensed as i am over this turn of events we are witnessing in effect foul play today and i urge my colleagues to let it be known in no uncertain terms by voting down the previous question and give us an opportunity to substitute a rule to make in order our package of amendments that we are so concerned about finally today surely will go down as the day

basic principle of freedom of travel and which discriminate against a group of human beings in an ugly act of official prejudice this law denies the right of entry to this country to lesbians and gay

morality but its real origins lie in fear and ignorance and in that ancient scourge of humankindprejudice from ancient times until the present lesbians and gay men have made history have contributed

amend h r 3512 to further delete 28 15 million the specific project i am moving to defer is the downtown people mover in los angeles beyond the fact that this project is an attempt to undo the presidents economic program and the lattagramm amendment this project is an utter waste of tax dollars let me explain briefly what i mean first this project will end up costing millions of tax dollars when originally conceived it was supposed to cost 124 million recent estimates put the price tag for the full system at 259 million although proponents are now willing to scale that back to 175 million so we are actually saving many more millions by deferring this 28 5 million today the project would place a disney land monorail around a 2 9 miles of downtown los angeles this is an area that is virtually deserted except during business hours this is not a mass transit system it will not take cars off the los angeles freeway because in order to get to this monorail you would have to travel either by bus or vehicle to reach it 7 he gao says this area would be bcter off served by bus rather than by rail transit and there is already a minibus service operating very successfully furthermore every independent group that has looked at this project has recommended that it not be built for example a citizens advisory committee was formed to study it and they spent 1 year doing so the advisory committee recommended that the los angeles people mover not be built the society of professional engineers recommends against it as do the league of women voters and the citys major papers and radio and television stations in short except for a small group of special interests no one wants this project los angeles has severe transportation problems and this particular project would do nothing to alleviate them it does not take our disadvantaged citizens from where they live to where they can find jobs so what we have is a project that does not make economic sense it does not make transportation sense we are going to ibe making some extremely difficult decisions in the house in the next few months concerning funding for various projects and programs why should we spend this 28 5 million today and eventually millions of dollars more to fund a project that every independent observer says is not a good idea i believe each project must be looked at individually there may be places in this country where a people mover project would be viable in los angeles it is not the taxpayers in this country do not need to have their money wasted so i ask you to join with me today in voting in favor of deferring this additional 28 5 million from h r 3512 the taxpayers who pay the bills and the people who need real transportation solutions will thank you"], [0.0008684694766998291,

rise in support of the latta budget substitute and urge the support of my colleagues as well although there are areas of this budget with which i do not agree i believe this measure holds the greatest hope for restoring economic prosperity to this great nation i believe support of the latta budget will be in the overall best interest of this country our economy and the future of our children i would like to also urge my colleagues who will be appointed as conferees on this legislation to review with special care the section of the budget regarding postal subsidies where i agree that some revisions in the postal rate subsidy are needed to make the system more equitable i believe a dramatic alteration in the postal subsidy as proposed under the latta bill could have dire conse quences for particular individuals in our society i am referring to the blind and handicapped individuals who rely heavily on this postal subsidy for acquisition of library and related materials most of us are blessed with sight and more often than not take for granted our ability to walk to a nearby library or bookstore to acquire reading material but consider momentarily the plight of the sightless handicapped person who must rely on the postman to deliver the livelihood material and information provided by a library equipped to accommodate the needs of the blind the staggering costs of sudden responsibility for these materials would be to not only deny these individuals the small privileges such access to information allows but would further compound the handicap of blindness i am supporting the latta budget proposal even with these problem areas because i have confidence in the compassion of my colleagues to use the senate language and work out a compromise as related to postal subsidies i hope my conferee colleagues will consider these concerns carefully while negotiating a compromise on postal subsidies i believe sudden elimination of this subsidy could seriously
