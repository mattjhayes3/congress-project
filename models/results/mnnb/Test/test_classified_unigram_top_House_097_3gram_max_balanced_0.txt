federal civil rights efforts an unintended effect of the many statutes and regulations which provide jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan administration in 1977 many of those who have cosponsored h r 5689 introduced legislation to make the law rationally applicable and consistent and provide greater protection to individuals discriminated against over the past several months i have been working with respresentatives of the leadership conference on civil rights and using their valuable suggestions for improvement in the 1977 bill and subsequent drafts although the leadership conference disagrees with some of the specifics of the bill as well as its timing they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the justice departments enforcement efforts reflect their deep concern with this important issue the civil rights act of 1982 provides uniform procedures and requires prompt investigation and resolution of civil rights complaints agencies which are responsible for program evaluation and civil rights compliance retain the authority to conduct investigations and attempt to resolve complaints for the first time overall enforcement is centralized and made mandatory i hope that the congress views this legislation as a basis for exploration of critical issues in federal civil rights enforcement the overall role of the justice department the proper test to avoid actions which have discriminatory effects an affirmative duty of the federal government to provide protection against discrimination should be deliberated in hearings before the house judiciary committee idarch 3 1982 h r 5689 embraces existing standards of effect for proving discrimination for those statutes which do not have standards for enforcement we have provided a compromise test of reasonably forseeable effects i believe the congress should explore how best to frame a reasonable test that compli s with the underlying affirmative duty to avoid actions which produce discriminatory effects h r 5689 is an attempt to provide a basis for consensus the civil rights act of 1982 is intended to dramatically improve the effectiveness of current federal civil rights enforcement efforts the act would increase the ability for individuals who have been discriminated against to petition the government for fair and timely resolution of their grievances as a strong supporter of civil rights i am convinced that action is necessary to provide a real framework of protection against discrimination for all americans compliance with the civil rights laws deserves our utmost attention i intend to join my

nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong signal to the soviet union that we have not forgotten the plight of the baltic nations i would like to enter the text of the resolution into the record"], [0.5,

right to an identity as a people their freedom however lasted barely over two decades what happened to them is the history of all nonrussian states within the unitedstatess r a history of brutal expansionism and tyranical oppression in 1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love of liberty and commitment to national identity has not diminished by one jot their experience should remind us how privileged we are to live in the free world and should spur us to help people everywhere who are struggling against persecution i am honored therefore to join with latvians around the world in celebrating their independence day and i join them too in working and praying for the day when latvia will once again be free in fact as well as in spirit"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few moments ago the gentleman from montana stood on this floor and forthrightly talked against a balanced budget small matter that the balanced budget is the rule of law in most states of the union small matter that the families of this country have to operate within balanced budgets the gentleman from montana says quite clearly that he does not believe that the federal government should have to do the same thing i do not agree but he is entitled to that opinion well the point is that in the bill yesterday to which he referred when we asked that the balancedbudget language be approved we were asking that the law of the land be ratified the law of the land which today stands saying that we must have a balanced budget i would say to the gentleman from montana and the other people who oppose balanced budgets why do they not forthrightly come forth and seek repeal of the law all i am saying is as long as the law of the land stands we ought to obey it if we do not want to obey the law of the land then we should actively seek to have it repealed they should come forward let them come forward and take that issue to the american people and say that we liberals do not believe in balanced budgets we want to repeal the law which requires it then they would be really honest"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a major television newscaster this morning reported that last night we cast the constitution aside in order to play politics with tax legislation the tax issue last evening became the moral equivalent of uncola it was called by nearly everyone who spoke on the issue in the debate an unusual procedure but it was more than unusual it was unconstitutional and it was unconscionable once the american people begin to really understand that law means nothing in this body only politics and convenience move us they will have every reason to react in disgust there can be no better example of our arrogance about the law including basic constitutional law than our unusual performance yesterday"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a point of information on my records i had 15
