negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in

happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another

year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require

of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many

airborne pollutants upon our environment has become strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of

vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed

college and received his bachelor of arts degree in 1942 from 1943 through 1946 he served in the army air force after his discharge from the military bernie held positions with the department of the army the veterans administration the census bureau and the unitedstates postal service before coming to hud and the legislative reference office in 1954 bernie served his apprenticeship in legislative reference until 1968 when he became its directora position he held until his retirement the legislative reference office is the headquarters for all legislative and regulatory materialscurrent and several years oldthat pertain to hud although bernies ability to maneuver deftly and swiftly through seas of paper to retrieve requested committee reports from congresses past is legendary in the halls of hud he has three attributes that combined to truly raise his position and performance to an art formvoluminous knowledge of the legislative process huds basic laws and authorities and how to find and work with legislative materials a detectives pride in pursuing even the barest of leads to successful resolution and a superabundance of patience for all with whom he dealt whether it is literally true as some have said that bernie has not forgotten any of the millions of pieces of paper he has ever touched there are few skeptics among the legions over the years who have sought his help in locating legislative or regulatory materials bernie was able almost unfailingly and often instantlyto recall legislative and regulatory items no matter how old convoluted or obscure bernie could produce however far more than the written word he could frequently recall important or interesting aspects of a bills legislative history whether a given amendment was adopted in conference on the floor or in committee and how far an unenacted measure proceeded in the congress and why it did not go fartherinformation that often is of critical importance to the legislative analyst perhaps most importantly bernie was able to use his vast knowledge to identify other bills and legislative materials needed to complete his clients knowledge indeed if bernies clients had the good sense to stay with him until he exhausted his knowledge on their area of inquiryand most didthey were treated to an informed discourse from a true expert and could return to their assignments with many hours saved and a full reservoir of information upon which to draw a former hud official said one doesnt have to ask bernie a good question to get a good answer bernie always approached his work as if he were a master detective clients would frequently have only a vague notion of what they wanted and would give him the thinnest clues with which to work bernies expression was one of total absorption and pure enjoyment as he methodically reasoned and questioned his way through the maze that so often attends legislative research and produced a full response that was precisely what the client ordered bernie also had an uncanny way of sensing what clients really wanted before they knew it themselves needless to say these abilities made bernie a constant source of information for those at hud and even some congressional staffers who needed to get the story right and in full the first time thoughout his entire 33 years in legislative reference bernie remained consummmately patient in his work he was always willing to take the timein an informative never condescending wayto ensure that his message was understood irrespective of the clients rank or position he also worked at a deliberate thoughtful pace that didnt vary in the face of a rush assignment but continually produced results faster than anyone expected remarkably no one can recollect even a single incident in which he lost his temper although surely he must have been sorely tested in his long career of serving the public bernie genuinely understood that the hallmark of his profession was to ensure that each client left his office with the information necessary to do his or her job better this was the principle that guided bernies many years at hud indeed it is one to which all of us would do well to aspire each of us i am sure echoes the words former hud secretary moon landrieu wrote about bernie i am proud to be associated with a civil servant as dedicated and competent as mr banks we wish bernie all the best wishes and health in his retirement"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today we are honored to have with us an unusual group of people these people represent thousands of other students teachers

of this house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to

colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion

the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit

defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many

vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters the sierra club the national audubon society the national clean air coalition and numerous other groups i urge all members to join this bipartisan effort by supporting my amendment"]]}
