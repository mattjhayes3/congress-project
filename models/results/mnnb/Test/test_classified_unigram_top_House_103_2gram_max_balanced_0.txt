given 10 days ago was being rammed through the house without time for review nothings changed we are trying to ram another bill through that no member has read this rule is no different my constituents and my crime control advisors have been clear they want more police more prisons community notification when violent sex offenders are releasedand beyond that they want the federal government to get out of the way ten days ago many of us complained that the conference report had cut prison funding below the level of the house bill nothing has changed the house bill had 13 5billion for prisons this one has 9 7 billion we said then that the claim of funding 100 000 police was a sham it is still a sham just 20 000 policenot 100 000are fully funded it is still a hoax tendays ago a bipartisan majority decided that the crime bill had 7 billion for social programs that would not reduce crime twothirds of that money remains ten days ago i rose to complain about bogus language that supposedly allowed local police to notify a community when a sexual predator was released into their midst after nearly 4 hours of tough negotiations we conferees finally succeeded in reinserting true community notification language that should have been there in the first placelanguage that had been approved by 407 members of the house and unanimously accepted in the senate no question this is one small victory for the women and families in this nation but the bill we are considering is a massive bill that still misrepresents the number of police it funds that still

president clinton is asking the american people to pay more taxes and government civilian and military employees are being told they have a pay freeze congressional staff who receive sixfigure salaries will be eligible for a pay increase according to the bureau of labor statistics the average salary for someone working in the private sector is 24 000 per year yet by your action you are

years ago thomas jefferson wrote that if he could add just one amendment to the constitution it would be a prohibition against congress borrowing money such an amendment he reasoned would defend the american people from the tyranny of government by keeping the federal government within its constitutional bounds if jefferson thought taxation without representation was bad he should see it with representation unfortunately mr jefferson never got his amendment and the government we have now is the culmination of his fears a bloated and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that the amendment would demean the constitution tie congress hands and hurt the economy the house defeated the amendment by nine votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 500 billion let us end this deficit madness let us allow future generations of americans to decide for themselves how they want to spend their money the balanced budget amendment is not the final answer to our fiscal problems but it will provide a measure of discipline that doesnt exist now for that

to put its fiscal house in order and of his vision for this country quite frankly i disagree on his views of broad new taxes for the families of america and quite frankly i believe that the public is having increased concerns regarding taxes that will reach deeply into the pocket of everyand i repeat everymiddleclass family in america but today i wish to speak of the area of spending cuts where there is total agreement thus tomorrow on behalf of myself and my freshman republican colleagues i will introduce a modest amendment before the accounts subcommittee that will reduce nonstatutory committee spending by 25 percent this amendment will cut onequarter from last years total authorization for the standing committees and will make allowances for the many committees that have a history of lean budgeting and fairly allocating resources the american public has indeed signalled a willingness to sacrifice but i believe their definition of sacrifice is for their elected officials to first cut spending i hope every member will contact the membership of the accounts subcommittee and tell them that the need to put americas fiscal house in order must begin right here in americas

where you are supposed to lay any spending bill or any legislation on the desk for 3 days so that we can go through it but what happened was those continuing resolutions would come through with 2 000 or 3 000 pages in them and they would waive the rules so that you did not have enough time to study them they would come in here with string around them and big red lines through them and nobody knew what was in them and they violated grammrudman and they spent way beyond the limit that has been set by previous legislative action and agreements and what we did was just went right ahead and they were budget busting bills and we had agreements to hold the line in spending and passing the continuing resolution just runs that spending right through the roof"]]}
