matter of fact he was a friend to people all over the world i would like to tell the members why bill mote was born in my state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled only by his charismatic personality bill mote was to all of us and will remain in our hearts a true example of what one person can do with a little determination i served on the board of mote marine before i came to congress i had the pleasure of knowing bill mote well he was a devoted husband and brother he was a counselor to marine biologists

an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can

throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at

that responded an overwhelming majority identified education as their top priority we are hearing this around the country that parents care about how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the white house over the last 8 years they care about a strong national defense they care about foreign policy they care about the

budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best

born out of wedlock today for some demographic groups that rate is as high as 70 percent tonight one in four american children that go to bed will go to bed in a home in which their father does not reside times have certainly changed in 1960 more than 80 percent of americas children lived with both of their parents in a home where both parents were married in the last census that number dropped to 57 7 percent when a family breaks apart in divorce children most often live with their mother the effects of growing up without a father are becoming clear according to the 1996 gallup poll 79 1 percent of americans feel and i quote the most significant family or social problem facing america is the physical absence of the father from the home i will never forget hearing the famous psychiatrist dr armond nicoli speak about fathers and the importance of spending time with their children he had done a study of the fathers in the 128 corridor around boston and actually calculated the amount of time in minutes that a father spent with his children today and compared that with fathers in russia and he made this point he said some people say well i do not spend a lot of time with my children but the time i spend is quality time and then he said you know quality of time like the quality of air and oxygen is very important but the lack of it will kill you it is important that we spend time and spend a good amount of time with our children what role does a father play in a home well i am sure we all have our own stories and mine is not necessarily right but some of the things i used to try to do is i spent 3 days a week in the state capitol away from my children and every night i would get them on the phone and talk to each one of them on the phone i would schedule breakfast every quarter every third month with each of them individually out in a restaurant with them to listen to them to talk to them it was a wonderful time and my kids are all grown they still like to have breakfast with me i still send them each a letter every month there are lots of different kinds of things that we can do as fan ilies we can read to them every evening there are so many times and things that we can do to express our love and spend our time with our children some men perhaps make better fathers than others i suppose but clearly overall children with two parents are greatly benefitted by it thank god for our single parents and our single moms but they need help and studies show that even in a high crime or an innercity neighborhood well over 90 percent of children from safe stable two parent homes do not become delinquents children with fathers at hdme tend to do better in school they are less prone to depression and they have more successful relationships the national fatherhood initiative founded by dr wade horn and don eberly frommy district have helped to stem the tide of children being raised in homes without fathers dr horn tells us that when the national fatherhood initiative was founded the topic of fatherhood was still not considered an issue of national significance the first and the most important task that nf1 set out to accomplish was to stimulate a broadbased societywide social movement on behalf of involved committed responsible fatherhood the national fatherhood initiative is doing a very effective job i think and celebrities like tom selleck james earl jones tiger woods and his father earl general colin powell coach joe paterno have all lent their names and efforts to this cause i along with several other members in congress have come together to form this task force on fatherhood promotion trying to raise the profile of the issue by legislative have means and the nfi has been very successful thousands of communitybased grassroots programs designed to provide support skills encouragement to fathers have sprung up all over the country dozens of governors have held fatherhood conferences fatherlessness isgetting theattention that it finally deserves according to the 1996 gallup poll 90 9 percent of parents believe it is important for children to live in a home with both father and mother this resolution recognizes that the creation of a better country depends in large part on the active involvement of both parents fathers in helping rearing and developing their children this resolution urges each father in america to accept his full share of responsibility for the lives of his children to be actively involved in rearing his children to encourage the academic moral spiritual development of his children this resolution urges governments and institutions at every level to remove barriers to father involvement to enact public policies that are father friendly that encourage and support the efforts of fathers who want to become more engaged in the lives of their children it encourages each father to devote time energy and resources to his children recognizing that children need not only material support but also more importantly a secure and nurturing family environment finally this resolution expresses our support for the national fatherhood initiative its work to inspire and equip fathers to be positively involved in raising and developing their children the family is the core of american society as goes the american family so goes america the most

this member would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the va hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee the distinguished ranking minority member and all members of the subcommittee for the important but difficult work they did under the tight budget caps imposed in 1997 once again this subcommittee undoubtedly has struggled to complete the tough task of allocating limited resources among many deserving programs as a member of the house banking committee the committee with jurisdiction over federal housing programs this member is very interested in how funds are appropriated in this area although there are numerous deserving programs included in this funding bill this member would like to emphasize five points first this member in particular would like to comment favorably upon the treatment of some housing programs section 8 section 184 section 202 and section 811 programs probably were funded as adequately as we can under the budgetary restraints in particular this member commends the 6 million appropriation for the section 184 program the american indian housing loan guarantee program which he authored this seems to be a program with excellent potential which this member notes without appropriate modesty in recognizing the support received from many colleagues is for the first time providing private mortgage fund resources for indians on reservations through a federal government guarantee program for those indian families who have in the past been otherwise unable to secure conventional financing due to the trust status of indian reservation land second this member applauds the subcommittee for reducing the duplicative efforts of the federal government in rural housing and economic development after a funding level of 32 million in fiscal year 1999 for rural housing and economic development efforts in hud the subcommittee appropriated no money in fiscal year 2000 for huds rural housing efforts however unfortunately a setaside of 10 million is still allocated from cdbg for rural housing and economic development as a longterm advocate of rural housing during my tenure in the house this member nevertheless believes that we need to be careful of duplication and waste of financial resources in the efforts of the federal governments programs for rural housing and economic development the united states department of agriculture through their rural development offices has housing and development staff located throughout each state we do not need to hire new hud community builders to duplicate their work as suggested by the administration third however this member would like to emphasize his concerns about the community development block grant cdbg provisions in this act the cdbg program is proposed to be cut from a funding level of 4 750 billion in fiscal year 1999 to 4 5 billion for fiscal year 2000 a reduction of 250 million this member would like to certainly support the restoration of funds for cdbg to the fiscal year 1999 level in the conference committee the cdbg program not only is valuable to the larger entitlement cities it gives assistance to those communities under 50 000 through state administering agencies it is a government program with minimal overhead and bureaucracy moreover the cdbg program has provided invaluable dollars to cities and rural communities for such things as affordable housing public infrastructure and economic development specifically in nebraska cdbg dollars have recently been used in rural counties to meet their recent hurryup demand for the development of important comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances as a result of concerns over the placement of megasized hog production factories with regard to cdbg this member is pleased to commend the subcommittee on reducing the overall setasides by 266 5 million as compared to last year this member has testified at the subcommittee level that the expenditure of the maximum amount of cdbg funds should be left to the allocation of the state and eligible entitlement governments as compared to selected setaside programs fourth this member would also express his opposition to the elimination of the funding for the americorps program as contemplated by this appropriations bill the funding for the americorps program should be restored in the conference committee lastly this member is aware of huds concerns with the reduced level of this subcommittees appropriation however it is important to note that overall congress is providing more than 26 billion for housing and community development across the country an increase of 2 billion from the fiscal year 1999 mark moreover 18 new hud program initiatives deserve a thorough review by the authorizing committees before they are launched according to the general accounting office hud has requested more than 700 million for these ambiguously defined and in some casesquestionable new initiatives this member definitely believes we place an emphasis on funding proven current programs instead of understanding a wide variety of new initiatives many of which lend themselves to the use of discretion for political rewards because of the necessity to fund important housing and community development programs and despite the reservations expressed this member would encourage his colleagues to support h r 2684 the va hud

and i thank the gentleman for yielding and i am pleased to rise today in support of the gentleman from pennsylvania the chairman of our committee on education and the workforce mr goodling in his efforts to raise awareness about the limited funding for individuals with disabilities act idea in passing idea back in 1975 the congress required the federal state and local governments to sfiare the cost of educating children with disabilities when enacted the federal government was intended to assume 40 percent of the national average per pupil expense for such children while congress has authorized this amount since 1982 regrettably the appropriation amount has never come close to the stated goal of 40 percent last year it reached the highest level ever thanks to the efforts of our good chairman mr goodling highest level ever at 12 percent and now the president is requesting the program be cut to 11 percent for fiscal year 2000 this result has been an enormous unfunded mandate impacting our state and local school systems requiring them to absorb the cost of educating students with disabilities and in doing so local school districts have had to divert funding away from other students and other educational activities this has had the unfortunate effect of draining school budgets decreasing the quality of education locally and unfairly burdening our taxpayers local school districts are spending as much as 20 percent of their budgets to fund idea since the republican party took control of congress idea appropriations have jumped dramatically since 1995 the funding levels have jumped 85 percent over prior funding and have demonstrated our commitment to help the states and local school districts provide public education of children with disabilities i say it is now time for congress to make good on its promise to fully fund idea at the promised 40 percent we can no longer allow the states to try to make up the difference between the funds they have been promised and the funds they actually receive from the federal government in my own district the schools are strongly feeling the negative effects of the lack of idea funding east ramapo school district in rockland county new york should have received 2 million for idea but according to 1995 figures they only receive 398 000 a difference of 1 6 million similarly my own hometown the middletown city school district in orange county new york was expecting 1 6 million but actually only received 316 000 a difference of 1 3 million in addition to cutting idea funding the president has refused to recognize this strain on local school districts by not requesting any increase in funds for grants to states for providing assistance to educate children with disabilities moreover the president wants to create new federal programs which can do some good things for the nation but should not we be worrying about the programs we already have but have never fully funded we cannot continue to underfund idea and impose this unfunded mandate on the states at the very same time that we want to introduce new programs mr speaker it is time for the congress to show that we are truly interested in our nations childrens education by fully funding idea congress will simultaneously ease the burden on our local school budgets while assuring that students with disabilities receive the same quality of education as their nondisabled counterparts once the federal government begins to pay its fair share local funds will be available for school districts to be able to hire more teachers reduce class size invest in technology and more importantly will be able to lower local property taxes for our constituents so in closing i urge my colleagues to fully support our distinguished education chairman in his efforts to provide full funding for the idea program"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "a friend of mine died this past week his name was william russell mote he was not only

state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers

people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a

struck me most during the trip was a single man sitting on the steps of the capitol he sat there in plain view of the police with a sign indicating if memory serves me that he had fought in the viet

when he spoke i looked for a marker to remind me and others thatfor a single moment on a hot august daya descendent of a slave held the most prominent space in our nation and delivered words that will always stay with that space i couldnt find a marker or the words on those steps several months later at my home in louisville kentucky i attended a service at the cathedral of the assumption in which the church celebrated a moment of personal revelation by thomas merton the monk forty years earlier when walking out of the starks building on what wasthen 4th and walnut he realized in a profound way that we are all one the church celebrated the 40th anniversary of that event with a simple mass and marker to me the service and the marker were both reminders that the ordinary space we sometimes occupy can become forever changed by the deeds of a person who stood there i am confident it was no accident that the church waited 40 years to commemorate the event my visit to washington and my

the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of

how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the white house over the last 8 years they care about a strong national defense they

health care the president proposed a budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going

the 1996 gallup poll 79 1 percent of americans feel and i quote the most significant family or social problem facing america is the physical absence of the father from the home i will never forget hearing the famous psychiatrist dr armond nicoli speak about fathers and the importance of spending time with their children he had done a study of the fathers in the 128 corridor around boston and actually calculated the amount of time in minutes that a father spent with his children today and compared that with fathers in russia and he made this point he said some people say well i do not spend a lot of time with my children but the time i spend is quality time and then he said you know quality of time like the quality of air and oxygen is very important but the lack of it will kill you it is important that we spend time and spend a good amount of time with our children what role does a father play in a home well i am sure we all have our own stories and mine is not necessarily right but some of the things i used to try to do is i spent 3 days a week in the state capitol away from my children and every night i would get them on the phone and talk to each one of them on the phone i would schedule breakfast every quarter every third month with each of them individually out in a restaurant with them to listen to them to talk to them it was a wonderful time and my kids are all grown they still like to have breakfast with me i still send them each a letter every month there are lots of different kinds of things that we can do as fan ilies we can read to them every evening there are so many times and things that we can do to express our love and spend our time with our children some men perhaps make better fathers than others i suppose but clearly overall children with two parents are greatly benefitted by it thank god for our single parents and our single moms but they need help and studies show that even in a high crime or an innercity neighborhood

dr horn tells us that when the national fatherhood initiative was founded the topic of fatherhood was still not considered an issue of national significance the first and the most important task that nf1 set out to accomplish was to stimulate a broadbased societywide social movement on behalf of involved committed responsible fatherhood the national fatherhood initiative is doing a very effective job i think and celebrities like tom selleck james earl jones tiger woods and his father earl general colin powell coach joe paterno have all lent their names and efforts to this cause i along with several other members in congress have come together to form this task force on fatherhood promotion trying to raise the profile of the issue by legislative have means and the nfi has been very successful thousands of communitybased grassroots programs designed to provide support skills encouragement to fathers have sprung up all over the country dozens of governors have held fatherhood

wu i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from indiana"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a member of the committee on armed services i rise in support of this resolution to prohibit the use of funds for the deployment of ground troops in yugoslavia unless specifically approved by congress now this does not prohibit ground troops from ever going into this area for combat but if the people of america are going to be sent into war it seems to me the representatives of the people of america should be in a position to approve that in fact i believe we should actually remove our forces from that area that are already there in the last 6 years the manner in which this administration has circumvented congress when it comes to deployment of the unitedstates military forces around the world has been unprecedented so it should come as no surprise that the house is here on the floor pleading to at least have a say in the process the president is the commanderinchief but congress should not relax in its role as a consultative partner when it comes to the deployment of our servicemen and women so i agree with this measure wholeheartedly but i want to talk about why i believe that we should not be there at all in any military exercise there should be a clear succinct mission and exit strategy similar to our successful efforts in desert storm the kosovo plan and i hesitate to even call it that much does not have a clear mission clear goals a way to measure accomplishment standards or an exit strategy for united states ground forces to enter that region i also believe a more stable environment must be achieved by diplomatic means this is not a desert our technological superiority will only give us so much of an advantage in the rugged terrain of yugoslavia it will not take only 4 days as it did in the gulf the serb army has entrenched itself over hundreds of years and unlike in iraq they appear to have complete loyalty to their leader mr milosevic in other words if we go into this hostile situation we will lose american troops look at the history hitler had many many divisions in yugoslavia during the second world war and look how much good that did him i would hope that we would all support this measure"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as a member of the subcommittee on health and environment of the house committee on commerce the committee of jurisdiction i wish to clarify my intent in voting or h r 4365 section 3207 imposes new requirements on residents of certain facilities with respect to the use of techniques of restraint and seclusion while such practices should be avoided whenever possible i trust that the regulatory agencies implementing this law will do so in a reasonable practical manner new section 591 d 1 of the public health service act defines restraint to exclude any method that involves the physical holding of a resident to permit the resic ent to participate in activities without the risk of physical harm to the resident i construe this phrase to allow facilities covered under this section providing services to children and youth with serious emotional disturbances to continue using a practice known as a therapeutic hold when appropriate to allow a resident to resume activities as soon as possible"]]}
