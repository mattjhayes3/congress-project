event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this issue with a greater concern for the health of the fslic the industry and the taxpayer"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "2 months ago the wall street journal published a disturbing editorial about soviet abm activities breakout february 25 1988 based on a highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves certainly anyone as preocupied with the exegesis of

floor the question of a letter that was sent by 67 members of this house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we

protect federal workers from partisan political activities the act was adopted in response to actual coercion of federal employees during the franklin roosevelt administration and abuses of the merit system during the 1930s the purpose of the act was to protect government employees from such coercion and abuse in todays society however the hatch act goes too far and simply serves to restrict federal workers unnecessary in exercising their fundamental rights to participate fully and freely in the political process the hatch act is no longer required as the sole guardian against federal employee abuses due to the strength of government employee unions and the press it is difficult to believe that a supervisor who attempts to use his influence to coerce a subordinate to vote a certain way or contribute money to a particular candidate would survive the wrath of that subordinates union or public exposure from the press and it is likely that the political issue or candidate involved also would suffer as a result of the union or press exposure the risk of exposure for the supervisor would be too great and would serve as a strong deterrent to employee coercion or abuse additionally h r 3400 does not strip federal workers of a federal law remedy against coercion and patronage the measure would tighten hatch act prohibitions against such coercion and patronage by simplifying current hatch act language and rulings hatch act restrictions currently are very unclear and complicated federal workers often distance themselves from even permitted political activities out of fear of violating the act rather than serve as a benefit to federal employees the hatch act as presently drafted serves to silence these workers and keep them out of the political process altogether h r 3400 would rectify this situation simply by prohibiting all onthejob political activity while permitting participation in any otherwise legal political activity during the federal employees own time the need for the hatch acts cumbersome and numerous rulings would be eliminated under h r 3400 it is time for congress to recognize the right of the federal work force to fully participate in the political process just as other citizens do and to further recognize that federal workers just as workers in the private sector can deal with partisan pressures without jeopardizing the integrity of their work product i do caution however that the provisions of h r 3400 that would permit a federal worker to take a leave of absence from his job to run for public office go a step beyond granting federal workers the same rights of political freedom as private sector employees place at risk the publics continued confidence in the federal government and must be strenuously monitored as an example consider the federal worker john doe who under the provisions of h r 3400 takes a leave of absence from his job and runs for a local public office assume that mr doe is defeated and as permitted under the bill returns to his federal job further assume that mr doe learns that of the six subordinates who work under him and live in his district only one worked on his campaign if mr doe has the opportunity to promote this subordinate over the others and does based upon the subordinates campaign effort then the federal government would have taken a giant step backward now assume that mr doe has no knowledge of his subordinates campaign contribution but that the public is aware of the subordinates campaign participation and finally that the subordinate is promoted the appearance of bias alone would most likely undermine the publics confidence in that particular government office this perception of wrongdoing must be guarded against with scrupulous rigor my decision on this legislation has been a very difficult one to make i simply am not certain that the majority of active federal workers favors hatch act reform relatively few of my constituents have contacted me to give me their views on h r 3400 although i know of several polls that have been taken on this issue including an informal poll of my own they show neither conclusive support for nor conclusive opposition to reform furthermore i am sensitive to the abuses of federal employees that can follow relaxation of hatch act restrictions and i am particularly sensitive to the fact that coercion can be and most often is subtle a boss need not threaten his subordinate with dismissal or denial of an earned promotion to coerce the subordinate to engage in political activities that further the interests of his superior instead the boss may rely upon unspoken assumptions and innuendo that conformity with the politics of the office is the way to advancement and job security within the organization resulting in subtle pressure on workers to conform to the political philosophy of the office which leads to greater job security i am hopeful that the enforcement provisions of h r 3400 are strong enough and that the merit systems protection board will be diligent enough in carrying out its enforcement duties under the measure to effectively eliminate even subtle pressures to conform to office politics the enforcement mechanisms under h r 3400 must be closely monitored to ensure that coercion and patronage are truly guarded against much of the opposition to h r 3400 stems from the belief that it would repeal the prohibitions against partisan political activity now contained in the hatch act this argument however is simply incorrect and ignores the fact that this legislation would clear up the existing ambiguities in the existing act by eliminating and prohibiting all onthejob political activities instead of continuing the current patch work of regulations which are confusing and often contradictory the bill contains harsher penalties and stronger prohibitions which would act as deterrents against violation of the measure and should encourage and ensure nonpartisan

passed by our committee is poor public policy in his history of england thomas macauley recounted the attainder in 1696 of sir john fenwick before the house of commons in england some hundreds of gentlemen everyone of whom had much more than half made up his mind before the case was open performed the office both of judge and jury they were not restrained as a judge is restrained by the sense of responsibility 0 6 they were not selected as a jury is selected in a manner which enables a culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies the arbiters of the prisoners fate came in and went out as they chose they heard a fragment here and there of what was said against him and a fragment here and there of what was said in his favor during the progress of the bill they were exposed to every species of influence one member might be threatened by the electors of his borough with the loss of his seat another might obtain a frigate for his brother from russell in the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to wellconstituted tribunals but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free this account was contained in a case decided by the supreme court in 1965 in which the court discussed the prohibition against bills of attainder contained in the constitution recognizing full well that house concurrent resolution 262 lacks certain of the technical ingredients essential to a bill of atsindermost significantly it lacks the force of lawi cannot escape seeing in the resolution most of the dangers that motivated the framers to proscribe bills of attainder in the first place so powerful was the sentiment of the constitutional convention in opposition to the dangers of bills of attainder that the provison barring them passed the convention unanimously the supreme court has elegantly defined a bill of attainder as legislative acts no matter what their form that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punish ment on them without a judicial trial simply put a bill of attainder is legislative punishment with that view in mind of what the constitution innnded to prohibit the instant resoluticn would sem clearly to violate the spirit if not the letter of the prohibition the troubles of texas air are too known to attempt to recount in these brief remarks on one hand texas air has become the black ii 3120 sheep of american industry for its persistent labor unrest and unconventional labor relations in this regard management has attributed many of its problems to uncooperative workers on the other hand texas airs two principal subsidiaries eastern and continental have experienced service problems so severe that probably every frequent flyer in america has suffered in some fashion at their hands service problems as severe as this must have a multitude of explanations many of which i am sure would have nothing to do with its workers the point of all this is that texas air and its airline subsidiaries present the perfect example of the risk inherent in legislative punishment texas air has done enough things wrong to deserve some form of penalty and it has made enough enemies to assure a strong lobby in favor of its being severely penalized i cm concerned with congress being used as the tribunal of choice for punishing texas air whether or not the punishment is deserved lets look at what 262 calls for as a general matter it requests the department of transportation to perform an investigation of the management of texas air and eastern to determine its effect on the public interest in matters ranging from attention to safety to promotion of fair wages and cquitable working conditions the concern of the public with such matters is beyond dispute in fact the putlics interest is so great that the federal aviation act and the regulations that have been promulgated undr it are replete with continuing supervisory functions for the agencies that have oversight responsibility for airlines in other paragraphs of the resolution the secretaly of transportation is requested to do other things which are governed substantially by existing law and regulations while certain instructions could be regarded as a legitimate direction of the secretarys discretion most matters addressed by the resolution seem to have an intent other than to help guide the secretary for example paragraph 5 a now moot provision reads the secretary should not authorize orion air to provide services under contract with eastern unless orion establishes conclusively that it is capable of conducting such operations with the highest degree of safety since such a determination goes to the very heart of the federal aviation administrations function to suggest that it might need the exhortation of congress to fulfill its mandate is to attribute either great incompetence to the administration or great perfidity to eastern since i am aware of the great esteem in which the faa is held by members of our subcommittee i must conclude that it was the possible perfidity of eastern that motivated the passage af house concurrent resolution 262 i am not here to argue the virtues of texas air or eastern with apologies to the thousands of employees who make up these companies i have to acknowledge that i lack the information upon which to base a judgment about whether these comnanies are good or bad virtuous or wicked worthy of support or desering of termination even if i did have such i formation though it would not be my responsibility as a member of congress to sit in judgment over persons who are governed by laws of general application which this body enacts to the extent that congress takes actions which inflict a punishment upon private copanies and does so in a way that catches only the specified company and not others that may be similarly situated congress has usurped the roles of the judicial branch to judge and the executive branch to punish the separation of powers envisioned in our constitution was intended to allocate to each branch of government the power it was most capable of safely administering the passage of laws to reflect the will of the people was seen as the strength of the popularly elected legislative branch the meting out of punishment pursuant to these laws was thought to be a task best removed from the legislature thus the bill of attainder clause in the constitution as the supreme court has said that clause not only was intended as one implementation of the general principle of fractionalized power but also reflected the framers belief that the legislative branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of and levying appropriate punishment upon specific persons house concurrent resolution 262 is clearly punitive in its effect to be singled out by name in even a nonbinding congressional resolution is to be stigmatized in the public mind in a way that no company can welcome when he singling out occurs in the context of instructing federal agencies to perform tasks to which they are already substantially obligated aspersions are cast upon the company so as to cause real punishmenl this is especially true where the company is an airline and the implications relate to safety texas air and its subsidiaries may be deserving of censure or stronger penalties then again they may be wholly blameless congress has established rules and procedures for making such a determination if the rules we have enacted are inadequate to deal with a problem of the magnitude of texas air then i am confident that we can devise better rules when we eschew the difficult task of legislation and choose the easier job of condemnation we have missed the high calling of congress and we tread near to unconstitutional territory to conclude i fear that house concurrent resolution 262 is an example of the pettiness we can indulge in when we let wellintentioned concerns get in the way of defensible public policy i exhort my colleagues to take the

problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this

activities breakout february 25 1988 based on a highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but

portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is
