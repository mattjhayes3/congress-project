instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell

specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant

medicare patients i support the keystone xl pipeline and efforts to reform unemployment insurance all of which are included in this bill however these are not the central issues of the legislation we are considering today the issue today as defined by both political parties and the president is whether or not a temporaryand costlyoneyear payroll tax holiday should expire at the end of the month the real issue is whether it is responsible for washington to further shortchange the social security trust fund at a time when it is already on an unsustainable path this holiday is a raid on social security which is already going broke social security is unique because it is paid for through a dedicated tax on workers who will receive future benefits the money paid today funds benefits for existing retirees and ensures future benefits because you pay now a future retiree will pay your benefits that is why until last year this revenue stream was considered sacrosanct by both political parties raw facts demonstrate that social security is on an unsustainable path todays medical breakthroughs were simply not envisioned when the system was created in 1935 for example in 1950 the average american lived for 68 years and 16 workers supported one retiree today the average life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree three and a half million people received social security in 1950 55 million receive it today every day since january 1 2011 over 10 000 babyboomers turned 65 this trend will continue every day for the next 19 years do these numbers sound sustainable to anyone i recently asked a group of mclean high school students and a group of young james madison university alumni whether they believed that they would receive social security benefits when they retire not one hand was raised not a single one the social security actuary has said that by 2037 the trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits when this time is reached everyone will receive an across the board cut of 22 percent regardless of how much money they paid into the system let me repeat under our current path within 15 years all social security benefits will be cut by 22 percent granting another tax holiday is unwise it puts the existing benefits of those 55 million americans who currently receive social security at risk to continue a failed stimulus policy last december when unemployment stood at 9 4 percent the president touted the holiday as a oneyear measure that would help cure our economic ills and would spur economic growth yet here we are again after spending most of the year above 9 percent unemployment has dropped to 8 6 percent but that belies the primary driver of this change 315 000 americans simply stopped looking for work nobody can say with a straight face that the payroll tax holiday has had a meaningful impact on the unemployment rate nor would it if extended for another year does it make sense that everyone regardless of income will get money from this stimulus does anyone think that warren buffet changed his buying habits as a result of this temporary suspension or general electrics ceo jeffery immelt who is also head of president obamas council on jobs and competitiveness i opposed the legislation creating the social security tax holiday last year for similar reasons i just cannot support an extension that further compromises the stability of the social security trust fund real structural reforms are needed to stabilize social security past experience shows that congress will spend the next 10 years figuring out how to spend the money designated as offsets for todays bill on other projects it wont be used to pay for the bill knowing this i cannot in good faith support a measure to raid the trust fund without comprehensive reform to the system the expiring payroll tax holiday is costing americans 112 billion to pay for it we are borrowing money from nations such as china which is spying on us where human rights are an afterthought and catholic bishops protestant ministers and tibetan monks are jailed for practicing their faith and oilexporting countries such as saudi arabia which funded the radical madrasahs on the afghanpakistan border resulting in the rise of the taliban and al qaeda our national debt is over 15 trillion it is projected to reach 17 trillion next year and 21 trillion in 2021 we have annual deficits of approximately 1 trillion we have unfunded obligations and liabilities of 62 trillion we all know what needs to be done and that is why i have supported every serious effort to resolve this crisis including the bowlessimpson recommendations the ryan budget the gang of six the cut cap and balance plan and the budget control act i also was among the bipartisan group of 103 members of congress who urged the supercommittee to go big and identify 4 trillion in savings i voted for the balanced budget amendment to the constitution which would have established critical institutional reforms to ensure that the federal government lives within its means in addition since 2006 i have introduced my own bipartisan legislation the safe commission multiple times while none of these solutions were perfect they all took the necessary steps to rebuild and protect our economy in order to solve this problem everything must be on the table for considerationall entitlement spending all domestic discretionary spending including defense spending and tax reform particularly changes to make the tax code more simple and fair and to end the practice of tax earmarks that cost hundreds of billions of dollars because the extension of the payroll tax holiday is not part of a comprehensive tax and entitlement reform package it ignores the bigger picture everything must be on the table to enact sweeping reforms to right our fiscal ship of state does anyone really think that this will only be a oneyear extension i suspect that at this time next year congress will once again be considering another costly extension and what will happen the year after that if past precedent holds the 10year price tag of this holiday will come to about 1 2 trillion the supercommittee was unable to agree to any deficit reduction plan let alone their 1 2 trillion goal the consequences of this failure will be severe air force chief of staff general norton schwartz said that the coming acrosstheboard cuts to our defense capabilities as a result of the supercommittees failure are akin to having major surgery performed by a plumber the commonwealth of virginia will feel particular pain from these defense cuts bloomberg government reported that virginia is the number one recipient of defense spending how will the congress pay for this extended tax cut and still make the needed cuts to our deficit and debt i feel as if washington exists in a parallel universe after months of passionately debating the importance of reducing the debt the president and congress are now using all the easy and quick offsets to extend a oneyear temporary tax break thats barely if at all improved the economic indicators senator tom coburn recently said that the question the american people ought to ask is where is the backbone in washington to actually pay for these extensions in the year the moneys spent i think its clear that the backbone doesnt exist leadership starts at the top and the president has repeatedly failed to address our nations deficit earlier this month the president drew a line in the sand and said congress shouldnt go home until the payroll holiday is extended he has not drawn that line for the doc fix which is necessary to ensure that doctors will accept medicare patients he has not done that for unemployment benefits he has done the opposite on the keystone xl pipeline postponing the decision for yet another year until after the next election above all he has not drawn a line in the sand for a comprehensive deficit reduction plan in fact he has spent most of the year running from serious deficit reduction efforts including the one proposed by his own fiscal commission he has not proposed significant changes to entitlement programs or embraced comprehensive tax reform we need look no further than the riots in europe to see the destructive impact that results from the crushing reality of a government unable to deliver promised entitlements to its citizens there have been riots in belgium spain france ireland england italy latvia and greece and yet we are considering a proposal that moves us closer to europes instability instead of using these bipartisan offsets to pay down our deficit were increasing spending and using these offsets to maintain our unacceptable levels of debt the american people should be deeply troubled that congress and the president cannot find any bipartisan agreement to save our country but they can still come together to increase spending and shortchange social security there is something fundamentally wrong with this picture compounding my belief that the tax holiday will not be fully paid for i do not agree with some of the offset measures that have been included absent comprehensive reform some would have the oneyear tax holiday financed through a longterm structural attack on federal employees federal employees work sidebyside on the front lines with our military personnel fighting the global war on terror in locations such as iraq and afghanistan they put their lives at risk daily to defend our national interests the first american killed in afghanistan mike spann was a cia agent and a constituent from my congressional district cia fbi dea agents and state department employees are serving sidebyside

outbreak are federal employees the atf agents who were in blacksburg immediately following last weeks shooting are federal employees these are but a few examples of the vital jobs performed by federal employees we cant balance the budget through discretionary cuts alone we have to address the spiraling costs of entitlements because to paraphrase the infamous bank robber willie sutton thats where the money is if you care about cancer research if you care about national defense if you care about road improvements or if you care about the poor you should care about entitlement reform we must reform these programs to preserve them for future generations otherwise they will be made unrecognizable through forced significant cuts or eliminated altogether last december the leaders of the

million those 360 jobs barely equal the size of a typical large american high school graduating class and certainly barely covers students at one typical college per state with a typical major no wonder americans are worried about our economy when so many youth are entering the job market only to find there are no jobs so while our leaders on both sides of the aisle are deliberatingand unfortunately too much of this immediately becomes a battle of wordslets keep in mind that one way to balance americas budget one very important way to deal with americas debt is to grow jobs for each 1 percent decline in unemployment its 90 billion per year in federal revenue thats a decrease in unemployment compensation thats an increase in federal revenues thats 1 5 million jobs for every 1 percent decline in unemployment let me quote our colleague from across the building here senator rubio who said this is not about increasing taxes its about increasing taxpayers and this could do it now the cost per job in the failed stimulus bill was at least 278 000 based upon 660 billion spent of course that number per job increases dramatically and rapidly if you include the interest paid on that stimulus bill which takes us over the 1 trillion mark that sort of approach is not going to work and if we open our eyes we can all honestly admit that increasing unemployment is not going to decrease the federal debt or deficit we have to grow our way out of this now a bill that ive introduced and that several colleagues in a bipartisan way have signed onto as cosponsorsand i ask my

yield somewhere between 2 2 trillion and 3 7 trillion over a 30year period in federal revenues not from raising taxes but from using the standard royalties and lease agreements that come from this it starts out as a crawl and increases to a walk and then into a run as this money comes through what we do in this bill is about growth in america it isnt just talking about it its putting our money where our jobs are because it leads to 1 2 million jobs annually based upon estimates of the american energy alliance thats jobs making steel making steel pipes wire software technology its jobs for the roughnecks its the steelworkers the electricians and the laborers who work on these rigs its jobs for those who take this oil and convert it into gasoline and its jobs for those who have to put together all the infrastructure to make that happen beyond that what we do is we dedicate these funds into the infrastructure which america needs according to the american society for civil engineers we need over 2 trillion to deal with our current infrastructure needs many states find that 25 percent of their roads and bridges are structurally deficient which is unsafe but for every 1 billion we spend on our infrastructure it yields 38 000 jobs those jobs are for operating engineers and laborers and carpenters or electricians and engineers and for those who make concrete and steel and all the things that go with what we need for our roads our highways our bridges our locks our dams our water and sewer systems lets grow our way back to prosperity lets stop saying were going to send money to opec and watch them grow lets stop just pointing fingers and blaming and complaining about china we have the tools here in america to make this happen so while our leaders are over at the white house

jobs and shouldnt be in the business of handing out jobs in 2010 the american people sent me and many of my colleagues to washington to cut government spending and offer real solutions to job creation we have been aggressively fighting to achieve that challenge our country needs commonsense progrowth policies that will help small business regain their confidence when business owners have faith that the government will not raise their taxes impose new unnecessary regulations and pick winners and losers in the marketplace theyll invest more when they invest more the company grows and the opportunity for american jobs grows with it just last week we saw a very clear picture of the different visions for job creation held by folks in washington my friends in the senate voted on but thankfully failed to pass the buffett rule the act would impose a tax hike on one class of americans and would pay for approximately 11 hours of government functioning talk about a cynical ruse serving only to divide our country for political purposes but while my democrat colleagues in the senate are working to raise taxes on americans and americas job creators the house is trying to lower

students and his children and grandchildren they would have all told affectionate stories about how mr fant inspired them or helped them and wished him a happy and welldeserved retirement unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not
