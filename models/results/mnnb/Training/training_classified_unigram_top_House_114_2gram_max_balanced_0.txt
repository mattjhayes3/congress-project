in their health care and this bill ensures that adult patients struggling with mental illness will receive the healthcare treatment they need while allowing their families to become close partners in

the president of the united states addressed the nation proposing his strategy for a war against isis he struggled with what the mission was were we as a nation engaging to degrade isis to defeat isis to destroy isis and then the question arose in this body at what level do we engage do we consider an authorization for use of military force something that is proper under our constitutional authority yet 1 year later we have not considered an authorization for use of military force we have not had the debate over what is the role of this body and our current foreign policy and our current national security strategy against isis the only portion that we were willing to touch was the request to arm and train syrian rebels and this body i believe wrongfully authorized and appropriated half a billion dollars 500 millionto train syrian rebels yesterday we heard from the top commander of our forces in the middle east that there are either four or five individuals engaged as syrian rebels confronting isis 500 million five people the presidents strategy against isis has failed isis continues to grow geographically continues to be enriched russias hand is strengthened iran has increasing leverage every single day the architects of terror today are emboldened but they are emboldened not only by the failure of this administrations policy they are emboldened by the failure of this congress to do our job where are we in this debate where is this congress on whether or not we are going to consider an authorization for use of military force where are we today on the 500 million that has now trained five people do we stand behind that decision as a body i hope we do not the bigger question we have to ask and it is a hard question are we a nation at war today with isis or are we not if we are are we willing as a nation to accept the human and economic consequences that come with conflict the frustration you hear in my voice is the frustration we hear in the voices of the american people across the nation every single day it is a frustration about what this body does not do we should be having a debate over the authorization for use of military force i dont know how that debate turns out nobody wants to go into conflict we dont get to choose the threats that come our way we only choose our response and 1 year later we have no response all this is through the lens of an agenda that we continue to fail to do lets give voice to the american people on issues like border security and immigration reform on transportation on a budget that finally balances the frustration is not that we havent achieved these things it is that we havent even engaged in a legislative fight to begin to advance the agenda that is right for the american people we are elected to be custodians of the public trust and we fail that public trust every day we fail to consider the issues that are of most significance to the american people to honor the constitutional

in the streets people that were homeless homes washed awayone of the worst natural disasters in americas history over 1 200 of our brothers our sisters our mothers fathers uncles aunts our neighbors our friends perished in the disaster on august 29 2005 we lost over 1 200 people these vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown as a matter of fact mark schleifstein with the timespicayune published a series known as washing away in 2002 years before hurricane katrina hit our state and caused all this devastation that series accurately predicted the vulnerabilities accurately predicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like hurricane katrina upon our communities we saw what had happened homes businesses monuments schools our history our dreams our hopes our future were all flooded as a result of hurricane katrina 10 years ago this wasnt a third world country it was one of americas great cities that was underwater many people look back at hurricane katrina and they view the impacts as being parochial things that impacted louisiana and mississippi and alabama not something that impacted the nation nothing could be further from the truth when the mississippi river was shut down and all the ports associated with it across the gulf coast as a result of the devastating impacts the farmers in the midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market there was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these crops out therefore the farmers in the midwest suffered as a result of hurricane katrinas impacts on the gulf coast rail lines louisiana is only one of two places in the united states where we have all six class i rail lines in many cases the rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed therefore once again severely impacting americas intermodal transportation system the economy one of the places that has these amazing natural resources has an amazing energy industry petrochemical industry agriculture industry and many many others severely impacted causing impacts not just again to the regional economy but to the national economy one great example of that is gasoline prices following hurricane katrina we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon but let me be clear not in louisiana nationwide75 cents a gallon is the national average price increase as a result of those 2005 hurricanes on the gulf coast75 cents a gallon as i recall i believe that translates into 450 million in higher consumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had the 2005 hurricaneshurricane katrina and hurricane ritahad on the gulf coast and had on really the nation importantly the deficit much of the recovery that was funded by the federal government in fact the far majority of it was funded by deficit spending funded by deficit spending this wasnt spending that was offset this wasnt reserve dollars that the federal government had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster this was deficit spending our children our grandchildren our greatgrandchildren will be paying for decades for this i want to be clear this was preventable which i am going to talk about in a minute also the impact to the environment here you see the unitedstates army corps of engineers and you see the epa out there talking about the importance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the united states and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves more aggressive jurisdiction larger jurisdiction over our private lands yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005 we lost over 200 square miles of coastal wetlands in the state of louisiana alone i am going to say again a lot of people looked at this and watched it on tv and saw it as being a parochial problem a problem of the gulf coast a problem of louisiana mississippi and alabama you could cut and paste that situation you could paste virtually any other coastal city any other coastal state in this nation and they potentially could face the same repercussions the same outcomes as we experienced in 2005 because this nation continues to have a reactive policy to disasters and it is something that we have got to change we could have taken the hundredplus billion dollars that congress appropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover to help get these communities back on their feet across the gulf coast we could have taken a fraction of those dollars and we could have invested it proactively and prevented it from happening any city on our coast could experience the same disaster we saw and i remind you just in 2012 we saw hurricane sandy cause profound consequences in new york new jersey and other communities on the east coast i will say it once again disasters that were preventable and so this is something that we all need to be paying attention to while in new orleans while in south louisiana and mississippi and in alabama there were amazing stories of communities coming together of people coming together of resilient families coming together to ensure that while this did knock them down they were getting back up again and they were going to recoverstrong resolve from these communities all across the gulf coast one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the incredible outpouring of support not just from the gulf coast but from all over this nation and countries around the world committing to come help us recover across the gulf coast it was an amazing opportunity for people to come together to put down differences and to all come together in support of the recovery of these communities the recovery of these families the recovery of these businesses the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these communities across the gulf coast we are going to continue to see this play over and over again we are going to continue to see these types of disasters over and over again until we turn the policies around in the united states until we see fundamental changes i want to pivot back to the recovery i want to pivot back to new orleans i want to pivot back to plaquemines parish and st bernard st tammany i want to pivot back to lower jefferson parish these communities in many cases were destroyed everything was underwater everything i will say it again the homes the businesses the schools the hopes the dreams the future underwaterand 10 years ago 10 years ago unbelievable i think that most people would have told you these communities arent coming back they cant come back they have been so profoundly impacted that they simply cant recover from this but that is not what happened as you just heard mr scalise discuss people came together we now have an amazing progress amazing recovery of our schools in south louisiana amazing recovery in our economy as a matter of fact we now have tens of billions of dollars in economic development projects on the horizon while in other areas you are seeing people losing jobs you are seeing businesses close you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more small businesses closing and opening across the nation but in louisiana tens of billions of dollars in new economic development projects on the horizon as a matter of fact we have the largest foreign investment in unitedstates history committed to projects in south louisiana we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance and it is happening because our people are so resilient because we have come back because we have come together and because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources that louisiana is so blessed with the louisiana maritime transportation system that we have and the amazing natural resources in regard to the inexpensive readily available natural gas oil petrochemical industry the rail lines the intermodal transportation facilities we have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in mexico not in asia but right here in the united states in south louisiana in closing i want to say i pray that there is not another community that there is not another city that there is not another state in this nation that has to experience that has to go through the tragedy the travesty that we experienced in south louisiana the loss of over 1 200 of our friends our relatives and our neighbors to see the type of recovery to see people come together to see us finally help to build a resilient protection system resilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isnt going to cause the same devastation to new orleans as we saw 10 years ago i pray that that doesnt have to happen again the only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn from the lessons of hurricane katrina from hurricane rita if they actually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in south louisiana in mississippi and in alabama that we apply those lessons around the united states to make our communities more resilient to make our economy more resilient to make our businesses more resilient to make our families more resilient and most importantly to ensure that we can all accomplish the american dream i

would provide for a conference between the house and the senate on the zika response legislation as passed by the house as opposed to the senate approach which adds an additional 1 2 billion to the

crime more often they were called by relatives neighbors or other bystanders worried that a mentally fragile person was behaving erratically the crisis built and it ended in death further the mentally ill are more likely to be the victims of violence robberies beatings rape and other crimes these individuals are also 10 times more likely to be in jail than in a hospital if you are a minority

"1 year ago this month the president of the united states addressed the nation proposing his strategy for a war against isis he struggled with what the mission was were we as a nation engaging to degrade isis to defeat isis to destroy isis and then the question arose in this body at what level do we engage do we consider an authorization for use of military force something that is proper under our constitutional authority yet 1 year later we have not considered an authorization for use of military force we have not had the debate over what is the role of this body and our current foreign policy and our current national security strategy against isis the only portion that we were willing to touch was the request to arm and train syrian rebels and this body i believe wrongfully authorized and appropriated half a billion dollars 500 millionto train syrian rebels yesterday we heard from the top commander of our forces in the middle east that there are either four or five individuals engaged as syrian rebels confronting isis 500 million five people the presidents strategy against isis has failed isis continues to grow geographically continues to be enriched russias hand is strengthened iran has increasing leverage every single day the architects of terror today are emboldened but they are emboldened not only by the failure of this administrations policy they are emboldened by the failure of this congress to do our job where are we in this debate where is this congress on whether or not we are going to consider an authorization for use of military force where are we today on the 500 million that has now trained five people do we stand behind that decision as a body i hope we do not the bigger question we have to ask and it is a hard question are we a nation at war today with isis or are we not if we are are we willing as a nation to accept the human and economic consequences that come with conflict the frustration you hear in my voice is the frustration we hear in the voices of the american people across the nation every single day it is a frustration about what this body does not do we should be having a debate over the authorization for use of military force i dont know how that debate turns out nobody wants to go into conflict we dont get to choose the threats that come our way we only choose our response and 1 year later we have no response all this is through the lens of an agenda that we continue to fail to do lets give voice to the american people on issues like border security and immigration reform on transportation on a budget that finally balances the frustration is not that we havent achieved these things it is that we havent even engaged in a legislative fight to begin to advance the agenda that is right for the american people we are elected to be custodians of the public trust and we fail that public trust every day we fail to consider the issues that are of most significance to the american people to honor the constitutional responsibility we have under article i we have spent the last 2 years cloaking ourselves in the article i authority of the congress every time the president overreaches and we have rightfully done so but just as we cloak ourselves in the article i authority we have to recognize article i brings responsibility we have failed to honor the responsibility that we have under article i we have an obligation to have a very hard debate about whether or not we are a nation at war with isis and whether or not we are doing anything in the face of the presidents failed policy to actually confront the audible threat of terror of a regime that wishes to bring harm and destroy the united states of america this body has failed to engage in that debate i ask with the utmost

countryliterally bodies floating in the streets people that were homeless homes washed awayone of the worst natural disasters in americas history over 1 200 of our brothers our sisters our mothers fathers uncles aunts our neighbors our friends perished in the disaster on august 29 2005 we lost over 1 200 people these vulnerabilities were not vulnerabilities that were unknown as a matter of fact mark schleifstein with the timespicayune published a series known as washing away in 2002 years before hurricane katrina hit our state and caused all this devastation that series accurately predicted the vulnerabilities accurately predicted the outcomes of a direct hit by a storm like hurricane katrina upon our communities we saw what had happened homes businesses monuments schools our history our dreams our hopes our future were all flooded as a result of hurricane katrina 10 years ago this wasnt a third world country it was one of americas great cities that was underwater many people look back at hurricane katrina and they view the impacts as being parochial things that impacted louisiana and mississippi and alabama not something that impacted the nation nothing could be further from the truth when the mississippi river was shut down and all the ports associated with it across the gulf coast as a result of the devastating impacts the farmers in the midwest had no way of getting their crops out to market there was no capacity within other transportation mediums to get these crops out therefore the farmers in the midwest suffered as a result of hurricane katrinas impacts on the gulf coast rail lines louisiana is only one of two places in the united states where we have all six class i rail lines in many cases the rail lines and the associated infrastructure was destroyed therefore once again severely impacting americas intermodal transportation system the economy one of the places that has these amazing natural resources has an amazing energy industry petrochemical industry agriculture industry and many many others severely impacted causing impacts not just again to the regional economy but to the national economy one great example of that is gasoline prices following hurricane katrina we watched gasoline prices spike 75 cents a gallon but let me be clear not in louisiana nationwide75 cents a gallon is the national average price increase as a result of those 2005 hurricanes on the gulf coast75 cents a gallon as i recall i believe that translates into 450 million in higher consumer payments per day as a result of the impacts those storms had the 2005 hurricaneshurricane katrina and hurricane ritahad on the gulf coast and had on really the nation importantly the deficit much of the recovery that was funded by the federal government in fact the far majority of it was funded by deficit spending funded by deficit spending this wasnt spending that was offset this wasnt reserve dollars that the federal government had sitting there waiting for this unbelievable disaster this was deficit spending our children our grandchildren our greatgrandchildren will be paying for decades for this i want to be clear this was preventable which i am going to talk about in a minute also the impact to the environment here you see the unitedstates army corps of engineers and you see the epa out there talking about the importance of wetlands and the importance of waters of the united states and writing all of these extraordinary rules to grant themselves more aggressive jurisdiction larger jurisdiction over our private lands yet as a result of those storms alone in 2005 we lost over 200 square miles of coastal wetlands in the state of louisiana alone i am going to say again a lot of people looked at this and watched it on tv and saw it as being a parochial problem a problem of the gulf coast a problem of louisiana mississippi and alabama you could cut and paste that situation you could paste virtually any other coastal city any other coastal state in this nation and they potentially could face the same repercussions the same outcomes as we experienced in 2005 because this nation continues to have a reactive policy to disasters and it is something that we have got to change we could have taken the hundredplus billion dollars that congress appropriated following the 2005 hurricanes to help recover to help get these communities back on their feet across the gulf coast we could have taken a fraction of those dollars and we could have invested it proactively and prevented it from happening any city on our coast could experience the same disaster we saw and i remind you just in 2012 we saw hurricane sandy cause profound consequences in new york new jersey and other communities on the east coast i will say it once again disasters that were preventable and so this is something that we all need to be paying attention to while in new orleans while in south louisiana and mississippi and in alabama there were amazing stories of communities coming together of people coming together of resilient families coming together to ensure that while this did knock them down they were getting back up again and they were going to recoverstrong resolve from these communities all across the gulf coast one other thing that was truly amazing is watching the incredible outpouring of support not just from the gulf coast but from all over this nation and countries around the world committing to come help us recover across the gulf coast it was an amazing opportunity for people to come together to put down differences and to all come together in support of the recovery of these communities the recovery of these families the recovery of these businesses the recovery of the hopes and dreams of these communities across the gulf coast we are going to continue to see this play over and over again we are going to continue to see these types of disasters over and over again until we turn the policies around in the united states until we see fundamental changes i want to pivot back to the recovery i want to pivot back to new orleans i want to pivot back to plaquemines parish and st bernard st tammany i want to pivot back to lower jefferson parish these communities in many cases were destroyed everything was underwater everything i will say it again the homes the businesses the schools the hopes the dreams the future underwaterand 10 years ago 10 years ago unbelievable i think that most people would have told you these communities arent coming back they cant come back they have been so profoundly impacted that they simply cant recover from this but that is not what happened as you just heard mr scalise discuss people came together we now have an amazing progress amazing recovery of our schools in south louisiana amazing recovery in our economy as a matter of fact we now have tens of billions of dollars in economic development projects on the horizon while in other areas you are seeing people losing jobs you are seeing businesses close you are seeing small businesses shut down and a trend of more small businesses closing and opening across the nation but in louisiana tens of billions of dollars in new economic development projects on the horizon as a matter of fact we have the largest foreign investment in unitedstates history committed to projects in south louisiana we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance and it is happening because our people are so resilient because we have come back because we have come together and because we have plotted a path to the future using the resources that louisiana is so blessed with the louisiana maritime transportation system that we have and the amazing natural resources in regard to the inexpensive readily available natural gas oil petrochemical industry the rail lines the intermodal transportation facilities we have been able to accomplish a manufacturing renaissance not in mexico not in asia but right here in the united states in south louisiana in closing i want to say i pray that there is not another community that there is not another city that there is not another state in this nation that has to experience that has to go through the tragedy the travesty that we experienced in south louisiana the loss of over 1 200 of our friends our relatives and our neighbors to see the type of recovery to see people come together to see us finally help to build a resilient protection system resilient ecosystem to ensure that the next storm isnt going to cause the same devastation to new orleans as we saw 10 years ago i pray that that doesnt have to happen again the only way we prevent it from happening again is if people learn from the lessons of hurricane katrina from hurricane rita if they actually apply the lessons learned that we so painfully went through in south louisiana in mississippi and in alabama that we apply those lessons around the united states to make our communities more resilient to make our economy more resilient to make our businesses more resilient to make our families more resilient and most importantly to ensure that we can all accomplish the american dream i
