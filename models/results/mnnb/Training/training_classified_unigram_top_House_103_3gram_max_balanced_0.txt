{"top_correct": [[0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 come today to address the house on a bill i have introduced today a bill which is entitled the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 some of you may have watched the television program 60 minutes last sunday and were as aghast as i was at the ease with which we see aliens coming into this country at our airports and other ports of entry who have fraudulent documents or no documents at all and how they can come in and if this is the case simply say i claim political asylum i am in fear of persecution if i am returned to country x y or z and immediately the immigration officers release them into the public domain of the united states they give them a work permit they allow them to go get a social security card and a drivers license and 90 percent of them are never seen again not before a hearing officer or anywhere else it is absolutely absurd how this can happen and i am disappointed that we have not had hearings on this subject before i introduced a similar bill to the one i am talking about this time in the last congress but we have not yet addressed the matter what is happening in this country is that we have got a system abroad of people who are smuggling folks into our country taking advantage of a very big loophole in our law if somebody comes to this country and he or she has no documents at all we should not allow that to happen that they can just walk away into the society and have a work permit and so forth the reason why technically this is being done is because we are very liberal on giving someone the right to claim asylum when they first set foot in our nation either on the sandy shores of the beach or in an airport we say if you profess the right magic word and say that youre afraid that youre going to be persecuted back in your homeland because of some political beliefs or religious beliefs then were going to give you the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and have a full hearing on this matter well the problem is the immigration judges are not sitting at the airports of this nation waiting to hear these cases they have backlogs a hundred thousand cases sitting there in the nation today waiting to be heard it takes literally years to hear these cases and all of that time while people are waiting to be heard they are existing out in the countryside and oftentimes are not even showing up for these hearings when somebody goes to jfk as the 60 minutes report showed that they did do on sunday and they make this political asylum claim there is no room to hold them even overnight at jfk they are full at the house so to speak at the little bit of detention center immigration services has so they are immediately parolled into the country and given this temporary work permit and they are told they have a hearing in another couple of months they are supposed to come to just a preliminary hearing it does not resolve anything and then there may be 3 or 4 years or perhaps a few months if they are lucky for coming back for a fullfledged hearing if they show up what my bill does is very simple it says if you come in with a fraudulent document or no document at all any port of entry whether its an airport or a land port you are going to be assigned to a specially trained asylum officer there are already 150 of them in the immigration service today and that specially trained asylum officer is going to ask a series of questions to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution if they return to their homeland my bill says if you dont have a document at all if youve not made a political asylum claim or if you do not present a credible fear of persecution to this asylum officer youll be put on the very next return plane and shipped back to the country of origin you are not going to have a day in court here and an immigration judge type court youre not going to be given a temporary work permit youre not going to be allowed to get a social security card or a drivers license youre going to be shipped back where you came from and i think that is very important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this kind of nonsense once and for all i submit for the record a

to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the

the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague the gentleman from illinois but the courthouse in rhode island is in serious need of repair in fact yesterday during the rain the computer room flooded and was unusable if we are going to have a crime bill which is going to put billions of dollars to try and deal with crime in our nation we must have a facility which can administer justice in this particular courthouse which was built in 1908 this is not a new building this is merely an appropriation to repair an existing structure this building has 56 000 square feet of office space which house 107 federal employees who are involved in trying toadminister justice in rhode island it is one of the busiest courthouses in the country these renovation plans have been in the system for over 10 years for the last 4 years gsa has been working on them the alternatives to not funding this renovation are first to build a new courthouse which would be almost four times as expensive as these renovations the second alternative would be to vacate this courthouse and lease spaces which over a 30year present value figure would again be four times the expense of renovating this courthouse we have a situation where a jury which is trying to be empaneled whici would normally take 70 to 100 people can only sit in one individual room 40 people we have people in thecorridors waiting to hear jury instructions when our prisoners are brought into this courthouse they must ride in public elevators and stand with the public because there are no facilities yes there are times when i think we ought to look beyond rules which would limit our ability to deal with serious issues and i would suggest this is one of those times no one who is running a company would say that we should bind ourselves and not fix and protect our assets no one who is a legislator would say we should become so involved that we do not take appropriate action when we see necessary repairs needed yes if we are going to dispense justice in this country and we have i believe some of the finest jurists in the nation in rhode island we should give them the tools that they need to dispense that justice and that is a facility that has a courtroom a facility which could administer justice properly and one which is in repair we should not let this facility become deteriorated to the point of uselessness we

i wanted to comment to pick up a little bit on the problems with the budget enforcement act of 1990 the public should be aware that those tax increases did not come up to a level of 30 billion a year when they were in full bloom the tax increases proposed in this package net tax increases come up to a level of close to 87 billion a year when you get out into the fourth and fifth years almost three times the rate of tax increases as in the summit agreement of 1990 i think it is important to note that the name of the game here is to try to reduce the deficit the reason we want to reduce the deficit is that roughly 60 percent of the savings in this country the private savings are consumed by government borrowing those are savinge that do not go into the 1rivate sector do not go into buying plant and equipment do not go into new job creation decrease our competitiveness and that is what we are all about the other weakness of the summit agreement of 1990 was that it did achieve caps on domestic discretionary spending and defense spending and those by and large worked although the initial increases were a little bit too great where it really failed was to get control of existing entitlement programs that brings us back to health care which i want to talk about in a minute but let it be said to try to clarify matters that what we proposed in the budget committee by republicans were no tax increases and spending cuts over 6 years of 430 billion the way i count it what the democrats have proposed are net new tax increases of 281 billion over 5 years and only 160 billion dollars worth of net spending cute now that does not include what we are going to propose as a supplemental appropriation bill as i understand it that totals another 31 billion whichwould increase the deficit for the most part in 1994 but probably trickling over into 1995 but i want to talk if the gentleman would bear with me just a moment further about health care costs there is no component of the federal budget or indeed of our economy that is increasing faster than health care costs on a national scale they are increasing at a rate of about 14 to 15percent annually close to four times the general rate of increase that is what really is pinching insurance companies pinching families and pinching your government medicaid in the federal budget last year increased over 20 percent medicare increased over 12 percent and the prospects for the future if we do not come to grips with the things that are driving up health care costs are for them to increase at that rate which is the principal factor for driving the federal budget deficit it was the failure of the l90 agreement not to get control of health care costs and entitlement spending that was out of control that has allowed the deficit to continue to grow to sap savings and create the pressres of a 33s0 billionplus annual deficit let me speak to this a little bit further because i am going to get more specific look out over the next 5 years the baseline cost on medicaid is expected to increase 66 billion if we do not do something the baseline increase on medicare is expected to increase 112 billion between the two of them increasing at a rate of close to 15 percent per year the president said in his state of the union message that as a part of health care reform he would hope to get health care costa in the federal budget and generally down to the general cost of the cost of living plus the demographic factors affecting those programs that would be somewhere in the range of 4 to 5 percent per year they are in fact increasing at three times that rate so we have a heck of a challenge we have in this congress we as republicans have it the democrats have it the president has it and the american people have it we make an attempt in our budget proposal to try to begin to come to grips with this but i can assure you that before this year is out when health care reform proposals are laid on the table we are going to be in for a second round unless we really come to grips with true reform that gets control of those things that are driving up health care costs"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 thank the

important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this kind of nonsense once and for all i submit for the record a sectionbysection analysis of the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 sectionbysection analysisexclusion"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me there is more to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the american taxpayer and infringing on their rights to contact their congressman under the threat of a 100 090 fine"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 minute is

man the living embodiment of all that is best about the republican party there is one other term that comes to mind when i think of bob michel that word that phrase is semper fidelis another marine

tough votes that were difficult to make cutting back on entitlement programs doing things that we should have been doing all along he almost lost the election because of it in 1982 but he was always

"1 move to strike the requisite number of words i will try and be brief as the previous gentleman who tried to express the facts in the case of walla walla i would like to express the facts in the case of the providence courthouse this is not in my district but because we only have one federal courthouse in the state of rhode island it is in fact imperative that this body understand the facts on which this amendment is being based i have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague the gentleman from illinois but the courthouse in rhode island is in serious need of repair in fact yesterday during the rain the computer room flooded and was unusable if we are going to have a crime bill which is going to put billions of dollars to try and deal with crime in our nation we must have a facility which can administer justice in this particular courthouse which was built in 1908 this is not a new building this is merely an appropriation to repair an existing structure this building has 56 000 square feet of office space which house 107 federal employees who are involved in trying toadminister justice in rhode island it is one of the busiest courthouses in the country these renovation plans have been in the system for over 10 years for the last 4 years gsa has been working on them the alternatives to not funding this renovation are first to build a new courthouse which would be almost four times as expensive as these renovations the second alternative would be to vacate this courthouse and lease spaces which over a 30year present value figure would again be four times the expense of renovating this courthouse we have a situation where a jury which is trying to be empaneled whici would normally take 70 to 100 people can only sit in one individual room 40 people we have people in thecorridors waiting to hear jury instructions when our prisoners are brought into this courthouse they must ride in public elevators and stand with the public because there are no facilities yes there are times when i think we ought to look beyond rules which would limit our ability to deal with serious issues and i would suggest this is one of those times no one who is running a company would say that we should bind ourselves and not fix and protect our assets no one who is a legislator would say we should become so involved that we do not take appropriate action when we see necessary repairs needed yes if we are going to dispense justice in this country and we have i believe some of the finest jurists in the nation in rhode island we should give them the tools that they need to dispense that justice and that is a facility that has a courtroom a facility which could administer justice properly and one which is in repair we should not let this facility

mexico city was over 10 years ago we could see a tremendous change in terms of environmental concerns in terms of poverty but since 1986 the salinas government has done exactly what the gentleman says it has done it got lower inflation rates it has gotten lower interest rates it has frozen its spending it is starting to live within its means as a result of that their economy is starting to grow as a result of that their cost of living and their opportunities to buy more have more disposable income buy more products from the united states have grown as well since 1986 mexico joined the gatt"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 thank the gentleman for yielding i wanted to comment to pick up a little bit on the problems with the budget enforcement act of 1990 the public should be aware that those tax increases did not come up to a level of 30 billion a year when they were in full bloom the tax increases proposed in this package net tax increases come up to a level of close to 87 billion a year when you get out into the fourth and fifth years almost three times the rate of tax increases as in the summit agreement of 1990 i think it is important to note that the name of the game here is to try to reduce the deficit the reason we want to reduce the deficit is that roughly 60 percent of the savings in this country the private savings are consumed by government borrowing those are savinge that do not go into the 1rivate sector do not go into buying plant and equipment do not go into new job creation decrease our competitiveness and that is what we are all about the other weakness of the summit agreement of 1990 was that it did achieve caps on domestic discretionary spending and defense spending and those by and large worked although the initial increases were a little bit too great where it really failed was to get control of existing entitlement programs that brings us back to health care which i want to talk about in a minute but let it be said to try to clarify matters that what we proposed in the budget committee by republicans were no tax increases and spending cuts over 6 years of 430 billion the way i count it what the democrats have proposed are net new tax increases of 281 billion over 5 years and only 160 billion dollars worth of net spending cute now that does not include what we are going to propose as a supplemental appropriation bill as i understand it that totals another 31 billion whichwould increase the deficit for the most part in 1994 but probably trickling over into 1995 but i want to talk if the gentleman would bear with me just a moment further about health care costs there is no component of the federal budget or indeed of our economy that is increasing faster than health care costs on a national scale they are increasing at a rate of about 14 to 15percent annually close to four times the general rate of increase that is what really is pinching insurance companies pinching families and pinching your government medicaid in the federal budget last year increased over 20 percent medicare increased over 12 percent and the prospects for the future if we do not come to grips with the things that are driving up health care costs are for them to increase at that rate which is the principal factor for driving the federal budget deficit it was the failure of the l90 agreement not to get control of health care costs and entitlement spending that was out of control that has allowed the deficit to continue to grow to sap savings and create the pressres of a 33s0 billionplus annual deficit let me speak to this a little bit further because i am going to get more specific look out over the next 5 years the baseline cost on medicaid is expected to increase 66 billion if we do not do something the baseline increase on medicare is expected to increase 112 billion between the two of them increasing at a rate of close to 15 percent per year the president said in his state of the union message that as a part of health care reform he would hope to get health care costa in the federal budget and generally down to the general cost of the cost of living plus the demographic factors affecting those programs that would be somewhere in the range of 4 to 5 percent per year they are in fact increasing at three times that rate so we have a heck of a challenge we have in this congress we as republicans have it the democrats have it the president has it and the american people have it we make an attempt in our budget proposal to try to begin to come to grips with this but i can assure you that before this year is out when health care reform proposals are laid on the table we are going to be in for a second round unless we really come to grips with true reform that gets control of those things that are driving up health care costs"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 thank the gentleman for yielding in response to my chairmans question i would have preferred that this issue have gone through our committee the
