variety of historical and contemporary issues our government functions more efficiently when passionate citizens engage in the political and policymaking process and i am proud that these students are already preparing themselves for that process through their education traci smith the groups civics teacher deserves our thanks and respect for the incredibly important role that she plays in preparing our rising generation i would also like to applaud the efforts of the we the people arkansas state coordinator jeff whittingham associate professor at the university of central arkansas who

convicted of murder conspiracy to kill and involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment even though the news of gosnells child slaughter was largely suppressed by the mainstream media many of my colleagues may remember that dr gosnell operated a large philadelphia abortion clinic where women died and countless babies were dismembered or chemically destroyed often by having their spinal cord snipped all gruesome procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim today the house considers landmark legislation authored by congressman trent franks to protect unborn children beginning at the age of 20 weeks postfertilization from these painfilled abortions the paincapable unborn child protection act is needed now more than ever because there are gosnells all over america

10 amendments to our constitution these most basic rights remain the bedrock of our society yet even today we have seen them come under attack freedom of speech has been attacked by some who prefer not to hear dissenting opinions forgetting that it applies to all the right to bear arms is under constant threat from those who would prefer that only criminals are armed and that lawabiding

right our founders sought when they fled their homes overseas is threatened by those who would coerce americans to violate their faith in their daytoday lives in every instance the house of

no retirement savings this is why it is so difficult to understand why the department of labor recently finalized a fiduciary rule that will harm the ability of americans especially those of modest means to save for retirement by imposing new and needlessly burdensome standards on financial experts who provide investment advice to americans the fiduciary rule will price many retirees out of the market causing a guidance gap which will lead to americans saving less money or worse not saving at all we cant allow this burdensome rule to wreak havoc on the financial future of american citizens i

member of the united states house of representatives i remember feeling so excited about the opportunity that lay ahead i remember vividly this chamber and all that it meant to me and to the country the men and women debating the big issues of the day not always agreeing but always fighting without apology for what they believe in over the past 6 years i have come to understand that this institution is far bigger than any one person and that freedom itself is even more important than this institution some of the worlds greatest debates have occurred right here in this chamber for what happens here affects more than just the people of my district or even my country over those 6 years i have done my best to contribute constructively to the process and to serve the people of my district and my country my guiding principle has always been rooted in the belief that washington should only do what people cannot do for themselves i fought and opposed the billiondollar surplus bill the government takeover of our health care and the massive new regulations put on small businesses but more importantly i fought for the people of my district so that their voice would be heard and respected by my colleagues for i heard that voice in every vote that i have cast but i also knew that being in the majority was key to making a difference so i am proud of the work i have done to contribute to a republican majority here in congressto begin to scale back the overreaches of a bloated federal government and to begin to bend the curve on outofcontrol spending that has only happened because of a republican majority and i am proud to have played a role in building it during this time i saw how slow the federal government can be and how frustrating congress can get but i also learned that one man can make a difference working with my republican colleagues and across the aisle with my democrat friends we have been able to pass legislation that helped businesses across america create millions of jobs some of them have been located in my home district but many more across this great country there was is and will be so much to do and i am honored to have played a small part in making a real difference but these accomplishments come with some frustrations as well that this body doesnt move quickly enough or as efficiently as it could to confront the challenges facing our country i regret that i wont be here when we finally pass a smarter simpler tax code so that every hardworking taxpayer in my district and across the country will know that washington not only cares about them but respects them and their sacrifice and i will miss joining my colleagues in saving and strengthening social security and medicare that will directly improve the quality of life for millions of americans for generations to come to my constituents back home the good hardworking taxpayers whom i have been lucky enough to call friends i will never be able to thank you enough for the opportunity you have given me to serve together we have tackled some of the big problems at home like economic development projects helping businesses expand improving our locks and dams along our riverways and so much more projects that have helped improve the quality of life in our community we have also tackled some small problems but big problems to the people who have been facing themfolks looking for help adopting children overseas or simply trying to get answers from an unresponsive bureaucracy here in d c solving those individual cases has been extremely fulfilling i am particularly grateful to have played a role in helping so many veterans get the respect they deserve and the benefits that they earned i am proud of the good work that my team has delivered to the tens of thousands of constituents who have turned to our office in their time in need my staff delivered for me because they delivered for you every day 24 7 i was never more excited than the day i walked into this chamber 6 years ago i leave here with sadness and humility for those whom i have let down i will work tirelessly to make it up to you i know that god has a plan for my life the good book tells us that before i formed you in the womb i knew you i also know that every person faces adversity in life abraham lincoln held this seat in congress for one term but few faced as many defeats in his personal business and public life as he did his continual perseverance in the face of these trials never giving up is something all of us americans should be inspired by especially when going through a valley in life i believe that through lifes struggles we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves and i know that this is not the end of a story but rather the beginning of a new chapter thank you for the honor to serve i look forward to keeping in touch with my friends in this chamber and my friends across the 18th district may god continue to bless this

to el paso i would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time today and also for taking me to your district and seeing that part of the border our trip a few weeks ago was great enlightening to me i have spent a lot of time crisscrossing those 820 miles of the border and it was great to see how the san diego sector and tucson and my fellow texans in mcallen are doing the same thing as the gentlewoman knows i spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the cia i chased groups like al qaeda and the taliban i have chased narcotraffickers all over the world and the threat is increasing and the threat is sophisticated the drug trafficking organizations in mexico are making 50 billion a year in the united states that is a big number their tactics techniques and procedures are sophisticated and we need to keep up it is about moves and countermoves what i like about this bill is it empowers our members of border patrol to do their job a lot of people talk about border security i like to refine it a little bit part of it is interdiction stopping people before they get to the border it is grabbing them it is having them in custody and then it is removal this bill is focused on this first piece of border security which is interdiction we need to make sure that our men and women that are on the border every single day have the tools that they need in order to do their job it is different in tucson it is different in eagle pass it is different in san diego what i like about this bill that was developed under the leadership of chairman mccaul is that it gives them that freedom and flexibility having spent a lot of time overseas i know the disconnect between the field and headquarters and that is going on right here on our border we need to make sure that the guys and gals that are on the border have the tools that they need this is a sophisticated threat as you alluded to using ultralight aircraft to deliver their payload they are using tactics that intelligence organizations have used all across the world to do denial and deception we need to make sure we have all the resourcesthings like the aerostats things like radar technology things like uavsin order to have that combined picture of the border this is something that for 19 months i talked to folks in the district i know like you this was a very important issue the american people sent us up here to do our job and our job is to protect our citizens and to protect our homeland this bill does it it is a strong bill and i look forward to working over these next few days and weeks in order to make this happen"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a costbenefit analysis prior to the implementation of a regulation requires a number of assumptions that make an accurate analysis difficult if not impossible h r 50 allows committee chairmen and ranking members to ask for the retrospective reviews of specific regulations i think there needs to be a degree of deference and some respect for the idea that it is for committee chairmen and ranking members both sides of the aisle not just based on some whim i think it is offensive to suggest that it be just some whimsical thing this allows an important check on any preimplementation costbenefit analysis and these retrospective reviews better clarify the true costs of regulation even president obama supports retrospective reviews and issued an executive order requiring agencies to conduct them more importantly retrospective reviews work in april of 2014 the gao issued a report on retrospective reviews at 22 executive agencies that report found that more than 90 percent of retrospective regulation reviews led the agencies to revise clarify or eliminate regulation text90 percent however the pace of retrospective review is much slower than planned and the 22 agencies reviewed by the gao had plans to conduct more than 650 retrospective reviews but had only completed 246 of them as of august of as you can see the agencies are already doing this work it is good to go back and review we shouldnt be afraid of that we should encourage it this provision in the bill simply allows congress to work with agencies to prioritize regulatory
