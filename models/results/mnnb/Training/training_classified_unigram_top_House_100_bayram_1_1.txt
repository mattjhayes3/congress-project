convenient for whoever is speaking the fact is that central america has been a place of great desperation for a long long time the somozas dominated nicaragua for 40 years america conveniently extended support at times when indeed we should have been pressuring for change that did not come through democratic and republican administrations over too many years in my first session in 1979 that debate was raging and america had made a decision to push the somozas out in order to provide hope freedom and opportunity economic growth and change and suddenly after that crisis we began to give money in sizable form to a new government and that new government suddenly we found was not the one we expected the business people of nicaragua had gone back to work others forgot about the crisis and the communists of nicaragua took over and the very people who came to this floor and pied to give freedom a chance peace a chance suddenly found the sandinista communists to be ok suddenly they

today is not its purpose or goal there is a demonstrable need for home health care in this country we need to address it and we need to do something about it but we need to do it properly this bill has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation

benefitsonly to find that it increased them too much we could not afford to pay benefits that generous without breaking the social security system so congress went back and tried to correct its mistake and presto the notch years were created in short congress was trying to do a good thing but it did not take the time to do it right we are about to do that all over again there is legislation in the senate to address the need for home health care there is legis lation being developed in the house to deal with this very same issue they are proceed ing through the regular process and they will come before this bodywith a track record of analysis that can demonstrate that it will be workable we should let those efforts proceed but trying to rush a measurehowever well meaningthat has

care only to have to dash the hopes when we discover that the program was not well thought out or properly financed that turns hope to despair fortunately our choice is not between passing this bill

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus

addresses the protection of the manassas national battlefield park which is located in virginias seventh district which i am privileged to represent the issue of how to protect the manassas national battlefield park is very complicated and there are many aspects to this issue the manassas battlefield park is located in prince william county va which is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation therefore the park is inevitably confronted by developments which have the potential to diminish the integrity of this battlefield which was the site of the first and second battles of manassas during the civil war in addition the park service has stated that the traffic running through the park represents a grave threat to the manassas battlefield park with or without the proposed william center or any other new development in the area the department of the interior estimated that traffic volume on route 234 which runs northsouth through the park will increase by 150 percent in the near future route 29 which is a major eastwest commuter road running through the park is expected to see an increase in traffic by almost 60 percent in the next 20 years finally while the traffic threat to the park is real and critical so are the transportation needs of prince wil11am county therefore it would be a disservice to the citizens of this county to simply consider how we can better protect the park without also thinking about how such additional protections will affect the already severe transportation problems in this area for example while closing route 29 through the park would be of great initial benefit to the park such a change would be to the detriment of the countyand would therefore have a longterm negative effect on the park itselfwithout a simultaneous widening of interstate 66 to carry the resulting increase in eastwest traffic any consideration of legislation to protect the manassas national battlefield park therefore should take into account all of the factors which have an impact on the park the county and the citizens of prince william county i support and am a cosponsor of h r 4526 because it makes the decisions that are necessary for the congress to make if the william center tract of land is to be incorporated into the park first this legislation provides for a legislative taking of this tract of land allowing the federal government to immediately take title of the property upon enactment of this bill into law by congress and the president the value of the taken property will then be paid to its owners by the federal government this portion of this legislation is crucial because acquisition of the land would be both prompt and thorough rather than going through the authorization and appropriations process which could result in delays of up to 10 years and cost millions of dollars h r 4526 further provides immediate authorization of up to 30 million in federal funds but not more than 75 percent of total costs to conduct a study of the traffic problems in and around the park and to begin construction of the improvements recommended by the study this study will examine the possible closing of routes 234 and 29 within the park as well as the transportation improvements needed to effect such closings including the construction of additional lanes on interstate 66 a new 234 bypass and an interchange between 166 and the 234 bypass the secretary of the interior the virginia department of transportation the federal highway administration and the prince william county government will participate in conducting this study and recommendations will be reported to the congress within 1 year this legislationby including provisions which promptly deal with the needs of the park the county and the citizens of the countyrecognizes the valuable heritage the manassas battlefield park represents to our country and makes the decisions congress must make for the acquisition of additional land and for road

than a farm problem it is a rural community crisis that demands comprehensive solutions beyond the scope of traditional agricultural programs congress unfortunately has expended so much time and energy trying to devise programs for family farms that almost overlooked are the farm families themselves who are trying to cope in this difficult transition period farm families and entire rural communities are in trouble and need immediate assistance that higher price supports and production controls simply cannot address with the urgency required declining farm income and massive farm and bank failures are bleeding the rural economy with farm land values plummeting 50 to 800 percent in the last 5 years local tax bases are evaporating and are insufficient to fund even basic community services consequently boarded up stores and empty plants have become as familiar as farm foreclosures throughout the farm belt the rural population of america comprises only 24 percent of the nations population however it holds 38 percent of the nations poverty 67 percent of the nations substandard housing and has a 9 2percent unemployment rate compared to the 7 2percent unemployment rate of urban areas for rural communities to sustain themselves in the 1990s they must begin now to diversify their economic base in order for many farm families to sustain themselves just in the next 12 months federal and state governments must provide immediate rural economic development and emergency assistance to address this crisis congress must act boldly and quickly today i am introducing the rural development initiative legislation i believe can serve as a government blueprint for revitalizing rural communities i am supported in this legislation by 50 colleagues as cosponsors the first step under rdi is to reorganize the unitedstates department of agriculture to streamline existing rural assistance and development programs currently scattered throughout some 20 agencies of the federal government the rural development reorganization act of 1987 would transfer rural development and assistance programs within usda to a newly created rural development administration rda this should ensure better coordinated and more efficient management of those programs this bill would also rename usda the department of agriculture and rural development to accurately reflect its new comprehensive mission the general accounting office is currently conducting a review of all federal rural oriented programs outside usda to determine which would function more effectively under the new rda before the federal government can expect private sector investment in rural communities it must be willing to invest in rural america by creating a rural investment and incentive block grant program we can provide the seed capital for rural economic development and encourage private sector investment through a rural infrastructure block grant program we can provide resources for rural roads and bridges utilities schools and other important services communities need to attract new business and economic development we can further expand rural economies and create new jobs by requiring that rural suppliers be given priority consideration on government contracts and procurement programs rural priority on the location of new federal facilities should also become federal policy if citibank of new york can move its entire credit card operation to south dakota surely the federal government can place new computer communications or administrative operations in rural communities to develop new products processes and marketing techniques tailored for use in rural areas local institutions of higher education can serve as centers for rural technology and training just as the crisis in rural america did not happen overnight we cannot expect the renewal of these communities to occur spontaneously therefore it is critical to provide immediate counseling informational and job training services for troubled families and displaced workers these emergency services can be provided through the creation of regional agriculture action centers one of the most invaluable rural resources we cannot afford to lose is our youth but with more and more young people leaving rural communities for jobs and a future in urban areas the face of rural america is rapidly growing older to encourage youth to remain in rural communities and prepare for leadership positions in a changing agricultural economy we must expand educational opportunities available to them today

requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in

external political this house that i do not need to tell it challenges that will undoubtedly play again tonight however the moral of a part in the countrys economic the story bears repeating we can no choices longer afford totolerate foreigntrade but it is precisely because of these barriers to american exports con challenges that the international comgress insists on real and significant munity has urged the republic of trade concessions from those who seek korea to further liberalize its econoto take advantage of our open mar my and lower trade barriers movekets we applaud the tough stance ment in that direction would strengththis administration has taken in trade en korean industries and improve negotiations and we encourage our ne their competitiveness making them gotiators to stay tough a promise and better able to cope with the developa warning congress will not only ing nations that will be entering the stand behind your efforts but is ready international market in the future and willing to rush ahead of you with furthermore liberalization would trade reforms if it becomes necessary forestall the kind of protectionism turning to the republic of korea i that korea can ill afford as an exportwould first like to acknowledge the driven economy countrys astounding economic success i am not here to engage in koreastory it is difficult to believe that just bashing in the past korea has re40 years ago the economy of the coun sponded in good faith to united states try had been virtually destroyed by trade concerns and those responses the korean war as recently as 1960 are appreciated however there are korea still had an underdeveloped still major areas of disagreement that natural resourcebased economy with must be worked out and commitments an average per capita income of only that require better policing on koreas 100 its exports were insignificant part american exporters have not and 86 percent of those exports were stopped pounding on congressional primary productsmostly farm goods doors demanding access to internain the midsixties the government tional markets if anything they are changed economic strategies import increasing substitution had been a priority en our trade negotiators will soon be couraging industrial development with meeting with their counterparts in domestic subsidies and import restrlc seoul at this critical time in united tions these policies gave way to an stateskorea trade relations when exportoriented industrial strategy both nations face new challenges and that has fueled a remarkable economic contemplate major policy changes expansion congress will be looking for the uptoday the republic of korea has an coming negotiations to strengthen an average income of 2 000 and is one of economic partnership that will benefit both the american and the korean people it is my hope the comments made tonight will send a message that even though congress is currently busy with an omnibus bill focusing on the big picture in trade we have certainly not lost sight of the smaller picture of our bilateral trade relationship with korea in all of this effort that the koreans have put forward to enhance their economy it is as i have mentioned a remarkable story in 1985 korea was our eighth largest export market purchasing 3 percent of our total exports in contrast that same year the united states was koreas no 1 export market buying 36 percent of koreas total exports the united stateskorea trade deficit though has been growing rapidly over the past few years the 1981 deficit of 200 million grew to over 4 billion by 1986 that is why i stand before this house tonight to talk about korea and the problems that loom ahead korea is not japan i repeat that they have shown a very goodfaith attempt to address many of the complaints that i have mentioned this evening and we applaud those attempts but must note that they do not address all united states concerns and in some cases are too slow to benefit either our producers or koreas economic vulnerability in 1983 the korean national assembly passed a 5year tariff reform package to cut general tariff rates down to industrial nations level by 1988 last year korea agreed to permit foreign companies to write life and other types of insurance policies in 1986 korea did not impose an additional 40to 60percent adjustment tariffs over and above general tariffs as it has done in the past korea recently completed a buying mission to the united states purchasing some 2 billion dollars worth of products in over 20 states now the korean government plans to open the entire color television market late in several weeks ago i announced that i was going to hold this special order this evening just today in the mail from the korean embassy the first time we have had mail from the korean embassy on this particular issue we get this announcement korea announces additional tariff restriction packages and this is datelined seoul april 6 the korean government announces today a sweeping tariff reduction package to further cut the duty on a range of agricultural and manufactured goods these effective july 1 1987 will affect 83 items in addition to those listed in the previously announced trade liberalization and tariff reduction schedule i will read those this evening because i think they are significant"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a feed grain buying mission led by the korea feed association president park chanyung has very recently been visiting various cities in the united states to announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus with us we can and do expect to be your supplier of quality grain and soybeans at competitive pricesplus beef and a whole range of food productswhich your consumers would readily buy if given a chance"]]}
