washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9

in government were a thing of the past after listening to the presidents speech i must admit that i found it ironic that just 1 day later the ways and means committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment ompensation bill when it enacted a me aim to enable individual states to trigger extended benefits in the future without congressional action under this arrangement 21 states would qualify on march 6 1993 for extended benefits with the federal unemployment compensation trust fund financing half the cost of the benefit currently these 21 states have a net balance of 16 billion in their trust funds and all they have to do to extend benefits is pass legislation to enact the prograr rathehai allow individual state le slatures to decide this issue for themselves k r 920 would circumvent the states by deolaring the current unemployment rate

colleagues considering all the critical issues that we are dealing with here i know it is very hard for us to turn our attention to something which seems as remote as that and far removed from our own domestic policy concerns as well as our own domestic political concerns but i want to take this 5 minutes just to continue to share a few observations based on my visit to mexico this past weekend where i had an opportunity to meet with election officials as well as political party individuals and to see some of the work that is going on with regard to this election because i think this election is not only as i said 2 days ago the most important in mexicos history this election may also be one of the most important for the united states for our foreign policy in latin america and certainly for our relationship with mexico it is my view that the government of mexico has done everything that is conceivable to try to ensure a fair and open and free election one that is devoid of the kind of manipulation that has characterized past elections in mexico that is not to say that there will not be inequities in the election that there would not be things that would be characterized as illegalities or unusual procedures but i believe that at the level of the government of mexico every effort is being made to minimize those and to assure that that does not occur but an election as we know consists of thousands and tens of thousands of people all over the country manning polling booths from the large cities to the small communities in that country as well as it would in this country so some of inequalities and the illegal procedures that may creep in may be done at a very local level what is the outlook for this election there are three major candidates and four others who are minor candidates who are running the three major candidates represent the party of the government the pri they represent the traditionally conservative marketoriented party called the pan and the leftwing or more liberal party the prd the pri has not lost an election since 1927 when it was formed it is likely this time in my judgment to come out on top with the vote but probably for the first time in its history without a majority obviously i cannot say my judgment is only based on conversations and polling data that i have seen not on anything else that i could judge but i believe that it is likely that we will see a victory by a plurality perhaps for the pri but with very close following by both the pan and the prd that is going to mean a very major change in the politics within the country of mexico because it will mean that this government for the first time cannot claim to have the mandate of the majority of the people of mexico we have had that historically in our country in many many elections and of course our current president was elected with considerably less than 50 percent of the electorate but that does not mean he cannot govern and it does not mean that the president of mexico would not be able to govern but it does mean reaching a different kind of consensus than has been done in the past in order to achieve a government that can work effectively with minority parties i believe that these elections are of enormous importance to mexico as they proceed with the transformation of their country to a democracy the changes that have taken place in mexico under president salinas have been enormous but they have been largely geared toward economic reform now we are seeing the next step even as i argued the other day in the china mfn debate that increased trade and increased economic activity will lead to increased political freedom that is exactly what we are seeing in mexico so i want to urge my colleagues as we finish up our work around here for the month of august before we go home to try to keep some of their attention on this absolutely critical election for our neighbor to the south of us a neighbor with a rapidly growing economy a neighbor with 85 million people in it a neighbor which is vital to our own interests in latin america and the world i know that all my colleagues join in wishing the mexican people

have instructed staff to call congressman studds to tell him i am taking this special order tonight because i feel very strongly about what happened i would like to read the newspaper article and then make a couple of comments about it the article was in the washington post and this is what the article had to say and i quote a unitedstates coast guard prayer breakfast scheduled for tuesday was canceled this week after rep gerry e studds dmass who is openly gay and chairs the committee that oversees the coast guard complained about the featured speaker a conservative who has spoken widely against lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military gary l bauer a former domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house and head of the family research council said he had been scheduled for more than six months to deliver an address on balancing work and family life but was informed a few days ago that the breakfast had been canceled yesterday bauer sent a letter to studds charging him with pressuring the coast guard to cancel the address i am utterly amazed that a member of congress would abuse his power to suppress free speech rights bauer wrote he said in a telephone interview that he believed studds had threatened coast guard officials over bauers presence at the event i cant help but believe that since in recent weeks i have criticized the presidents idea about changing military rules on how homosexuality is treated that i have stepped on the lifestyle of the congressman bauer said studds could not be reached for comment but a spokesman said the allegation that studds threatened coast guard officials was ridiculous now this next paragraph is of great concern to me it says spokesman steve schwadron said studds called adm j william klime commandant of the coast guard earlier this week to raise concerns about the invitation to bauer it seemed odd to mr studds that mr bauer would be asked to address an observance like this it didnt seem in a common sense fashion to be a pulpit for a rightwing ideologue to vent his political agenda schwadron said the decision to cancel the session was made independently by kime rep w j billy tauzin dla who heads the merchant marine and fisheries coast guard and navigation subcommittee said studdss call to kime also was meant to alert him that a coast guard electronic message system was being used to organize opposition to president clintons lifting of the militarys gay ban it was the commandants own decision to take the steps he took in ordering the breakfast canceled and use of the electronic message system for that purpose stopped he said he said kime was not aware before studdss call about the use of the message system or bauers political views or his scheduled talk coast guard spokesman capt ernest blanchard said the breakfast was canceled because there were some concerns from members of the command that all religious affiliations were not represented blanchard said he had no knowledge of any involvement in the decision by studds now the fact of the matter is congressman studds my colleague who has had some problems in this body i believe he was censured a few years ago for homosexual involvement with one of our pages called the coast guard commandant and complained that mr bauer wouldmr bauer incidentally is a christian spokesman who speaks around the country on family values and the purpose of his speech to the coast guard was to address on balancing work and family life and had absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality in fact this had been planned for 6 months long before the issue of homosexuals being admitted into the military had even been raised by the clinton administration so my concern is that free speech was impeded that there was an implied threat or the possibility of an implied threat by virtue of this phone call by congressman studds to the coast guard and i think it is very unfortunate that this occurred this issue of homosexuality homosexuals being admitted into the military is one that has not yet been decided by the congress of the united states in fact the president has agreed to postpone action on this for the next 4 or 5 months at that time we will have an up or down vote on it i am confident in the congress but to stop somebody who is going to be talking about family values and balancing work and family values from speaking to the coast guard at a prayer breakfast simply because he differs with congressman stfdds on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed in the military is a gross violation in my opinion of constitutional rights the coast guard obviously wanted gary bauer to speak they obviously wanted him to speak at the prayer breakfast it had been organized for 6 months and it was stopped simply because mr bauer had taken issue with the congressmans position i think it is a mistake i think it should not have happended i think it is very unfortunate i would just like to urge my colleagues to

and to conduct a feasibility study on constructing a veterans nursing home in central new jersey the va more than any other health care delivery system will be serving a rapidly aging population today 7 million veterans are age 65 or older by the year 2000 that number will grow to 9 million with 1 5 million over the age of 85 as anyone in medicine will tell you the utilization of health care significantly increases with age veterans older than age 85 need health care services 30 times as often as those under the age of 65 by the same token the need for nursing home care also vastly increases as the pool of potential users ages and expands my state has done an initial analysis on this we have found that the numbers of veterans will grow by 15 percent by the year 2000 in new jersey the need for nursing home care in central new jersey is unmistakable nevertheless i believe it is critical for the va to also conduct comprehensive assessments and mission planning these findings will aid the va in prioritizing new construction projects and in supporting state grant applications for new nursing home facilities americas veterans have earned the right to dignified

thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me there is more to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create

president clinton gave his state of the union address in which he vowed to the american people that the days of fiscal irresponsibility in government were a thing of the past after listening to the presidents speech i must admit that i found it ironic that just 1 day later the ways and means committee on which i serve marked up the unemployment compensation bill h r 920 which would add 5 7 billion to the deficit all of us can appreciate the hardships faced by the longterm unemployed however extending benefits to these individuals by adding to the deficit does not put these people back to work and actually hinders the creation of jobs by forcing the government to borrow more from the private sector indeed all we are doing 4s continuing to borrow from future generations to feed the insatiable spending appetite of this congress in addition recent reports show that the economy is improving during the last quarter of 1992 the economy grew 3 8 percent the highest level in 4 years this expansion lowered the national unemployment rate from 7 7 percent last june to the current level of 7 1 percent it is also worth noting that h r 920 would increase the deficit to provide extended unemployment compensation benefits to 17 states with unemployment rates less than 6 percent clearly if an unemployment emergency exists it is not nationwide as h r 920 suggests congress recognized these regional differences during its conslderatlon of last years extended unemployment ompensation bill when it enacted a me aim to enable individual states to trigger extended benefits in the future without congressional action under this arrangement 21 states would qualify on march 6 1993 for extended benefits with the federal unemployment compensation trust fund financing half the cost of the benefit currently these 21 states have a net balance of 16 billion in their trust funds and all they have to do to extend benefits is pass legislation to enact the prograr rathehai allow individual state le slatures to decide this issue for themselves k r 920 would circumvent the states by deolaring the current unemployment rate an emergency and add the cost of extended benefits to the deficl

dealing with here i know it is very hard for us to turn our attention to something which seems as remote as that and far removed from our own domestic policy concerns as well as our own domestic political concerns but i want to take this 5 minutes just to continue to share a few observations based on my visit to mexico this past weekend where i had an opportunity to meet with election officials as well as political party individuals and to see some of the work that is going on with regard to this election because i think this election is not only as i said 2 days ago the most important in mexicos history this election may also be one of the most important for the united states for our foreign policy in latin america and certainly for our relationship with mexico it is my view that the government of mexico has done everything that is conceivable to try to ensure a fair and open and free election one that is devoid of the kind of manipulation that has characterized past elections in mexico that is not to say that there will not be inequities in the election that there would not be things that would be characterized as illegalities or unusual procedures but i believe that at the level of the government of mexico every effort is being made to minimize those and to assure that that does not occur but an election as we know consists of thousands and tens of thousands of people all over the country manning polling booths from the large cities to the small communities in that country as well as it would in this country so some of inequalities and the illegal procedures that may creep in may be done at a very local level what is the outlook for this election there are three major candidates and four others who are minor candidates who are running the three major candidates represent the party of the government the pri they represent the traditionally conservative marketoriented party called the pan and the leftwing or more liberal party the prd the pri has not lost an election since 1927 when it was formed it is likely this time in my judgment to come out on top with the vote but probably for the first time in its history without a majority obviously i cannot say my judgment is only based on conversations and polling data that i have seen not on anything else that i could judge but i believe that it is likely that we will see a victory by a plurality perhaps for the pri but with very close following by both the pan and the prd that is going to mean a very major change in the politics within the country of mexico because it will mean that this government for the first time cannot claim to have the mandate of the majority of the people of mexico we have had that historically in our country in many many elections and of course our current president was elected with considerably less than 50 percent of the electorate but that does not mean he cannot govern and it does not mean that the president of mexico would not be able to govern but it does mean reaching a different kind of consensus than has been done in the past in order to achieve a government that can work effectively with minority parties i believe that these elections are of enormous importance to mexico as they proceed with the transformation of their country to a democracy the changes that have taken place in mexico under president salinas have been enormous but they have been largely geared toward economic reform now we are seeing the next step even as i argued the other day in the china mfn debate that increased trade and increased economic activity will lead to increased political freedom that is exactly what we are seeing in mexico so i want to urge my colleagues as we finish up our work around here for the month of august before we go home to try to keep some of their attention on this absolutely critical election for our neighbor to the south of us a neighbor with a rapidly growing economy a neighbor with 85 million people in it a neighbor which is vital to our own interests in latin america and the world i know that all my colleagues join in wishing the mexican people well in this election as they move toward a transformation

him i am taking this special order tonight because i feel very strongly about what happened i would like to read the newspaper article and then make a couple of comments about it the article was in the washington post and this is what the article had to say and i quote a unitedstates coast guard prayer breakfast scheduled for tuesday was canceled this week after rep gerry e studds dmass who is openly gay and chairs the committee that oversees the coast guard complained about the featured speaker a conservative who has spoken widely against lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military gary l bauer a former domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house and head of the family research council said he had been scheduled for more than six months to deliver an address on balancing work and family life but was informed a few days ago that the breakfast had been canceled yesterday bauer sent a letter to studds charging him with pressuring the coast guard to cancel the address i am utterly amazed that a member of congress would abuse his power to suppress free speech rights bauer wrote he said in a telephone interview that he believed studds had threatened coast guard officials over bauers presence at the event i cant help but believe that since in recent weeks i have criticized the presidents idea about changing military rules on how homosexuality is treated that i have stepped on the lifestyle of the congressman bauer said studds could not be reached for comment but a spokesman said the allegation that studds threatened coast guard officials was ridiculous now this next paragraph is of great concern to me it says spokesman steve schwadron said studds called adm j william klime commandant of the coast guard earlier this week to raise concerns about the invitation to bauer it seemed odd to mr studds that mr bauer would be asked to address an observance like this it didnt seem in a common sense fashion to be a pulpit for a rightwing ideologue to vent his political agenda schwadron said the decision to cancel the session was made independently by kime rep w j billy tauzin dla who heads the merchant marine and fisheries coast guard and navigation subcommittee said studdss call to kime also was meant to alert him that a coast guard electronic message system was being used to organize opposition to president clintons lifting of the militarys gay ban it was the commandants own decision to take the steps he took in ordering the breakfast canceled and use of the electronic message system for that purpose stopped he said he said kime was not aware before studdss call about the use of the message system or bauers political views or his scheduled talk coast guard spokesman capt ernest blanchard said the breakfast was canceled because there were some concerns from members of the command that all religious affiliations were not represented blanchard said he had no knowledge of any involvement in the decision by studds now the fact of the matter is congressman studds my colleague who has had some problems in this body i believe he was censured a few years ago for homosexual involvement with one of our pages called the coast guard commandant and complained that mr bauer wouldmr bauer incidentally is a christian spokesman who speaks around the country on family values and the purpose of his speech to the coast guard was to address on balancing work and family life and had absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality in fact this had been planned for 6 months long before the issue of homosexuals being admitted into the military had even been raised by the clinton administration so my concern is that free speech was impeded that there was an implied threat or the possibility of an implied threat by virtue of this phone call by congressman studds to the coast guard and i think it is very unfortunate that this occurred this issue of homosexuality homosexuals being admitted into the military is one that has not yet been decided by the congress of the united states in fact the president has agreed to postpone action on this for the next 4 or 5 months at that time we will have an up or down vote on it i am confident in the congress but to stop somebody who is going to be talking about family values and balancing work and family values from speaking to the coast guard at a prayer breakfast simply because he differs with congressman stfdds on whether or not homosexuals should be allowed in the military is a gross violation in my opinion of constitutional rights the coast guard obviously wanted gary bauer to speak they obviously wanted him to speak at the prayer breakfast it had been organized for 6 months and it was stopped simply because mr bauer had taken issue with the congressmans position i think it is a mistake i think it should not have happended i think it is very unfortunate i would just like to urge my colleagues to think long and hard before they start interfering with the coast guards right to have anyone they want to come to a prayer breakfast simply because a congressman may or may not agree with what they feel about certaln issues"]]}
