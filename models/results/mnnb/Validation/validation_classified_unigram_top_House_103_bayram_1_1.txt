congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the united states retains its leadership position in protecting the worlds marine environment the relevance of the united states banning radioactive dumping is far reaching

president boris yeltsin to detail the extent of soviet nuclear disposal at sea according to the report the soviet union had dumped over 2 5 million curies of radioactive waste into the arctic ocean and other marine environments by comparison the accident at three mile island in my home state of pennsylvania released 15 curies of radiation during the hearing the subcommittee discovered that since 1959 the former soviet union dumped 18 nuclear reactors a reactor screen 11 000 to 17 000 cannisters of nuclear waste and hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of communism moscow has continued to dispose of radioactive waste at

who supported the previous bill have taken the floor today to say that todays conference report todays bill is a better bill that then raises the question why did they support the last bill i think the answer to that is they did not believe that the last bill could be improved that the effort would be made to do so however we demonstrated in the house of representatives a week ago that it could be improved by the vote that we took to send the bill back to conference i believe we have a better bill today than we had a week ago i want to sincerely congratulate both the republicans and the democrats who worked on the bill nevertheless if we can improve it after two allnight sessions i believe it can still be improved more if we take some more time for that reason i oppose the conference report that is on the floor today that does not mean i oppose a crime bill of course but i believe that we have demonstrated those of us who voted to send the bill back to the committee that it can be improved that it was improved and i believe it will be still further improved if we work on it further however the question arises what about the need to fight crime right now i believe that that need is met by supporting what will be introduced by the gentleman from florida as a motion to recommit the bipartisan hunterbrewster bill this will provide funding to police and to prisons and to the border patrol immediately and those are the areas that time after time after time are so often publicly mentioned as in need of that kind of support the criticism of that alternative is it does not include everything there are many members who want to see much more enacted to assist law enforcement and i agree with that as a former career prosecutor i believe efforts against career criminals are an extremely important tool for law enforcement i support the strongest threestrikesandyouareout provision we can write and in some violent crime cases two strikes in conclusion i think that

congressional reform it dawned on me that now may well be the last chance for congress to begin to regain credibility with american citizens we all must know that there is a great deal of contempt for this body throughout our nation selfinterest corruption scandals and selfindulgence have left deep scars on this body and serious internal injuries we wont cure this body with cosmetic surgery organ transplant would be more appropriate because our body is in the emergency room on life support we are going to have to be bipartisan and we are going to have to put the american people first we arent princes and princesses or dukes and duchesses in a feudal nation we are public servants and we must begin to serve and we must be held accountable for our actions out there in the 435 districts in this vast land there are people who voted for us because they believed they could couit on us to represent their interests and not our own and in my way of thinking that vote is a serious public trust america wants change no america demands change and we had better heed that demand and correct the way congress does the publics business as new members many of us do not feel party to the mistakes of the past our concern is the future as mr perot has said its time to clean out the barn and we had better listen the administrative cost of this body is very excessive and now we have an administration that is asking taxpayers to share the cost and share the pain of tax increases this body is no better than the american taxpayer we have to consider their pain and their cost and substantially cut the cost of congress even if it is painful to some members the bottom line is we have to simplify congress get rid of nonessential committees and put more common sense and frugality into legislative passage or rejection that is why i urge all my colleagues to join me by cutting the size and cost of all congressional committees by 25 percent the war cry is eliminate gridlock but this house manages to create its own gridlock we can begin to put an end to gridlock by eliminating the overwhelming power of the seniority system after all one member from 1 district out of 435 should not be in a position to dominate the actions of congress my district is just as important as the speakers district this is why the republican freshman class has managed to successfully push through term limits on all committee and subcommittee chairs tonight i urge my fellow freshmen democrats to join us in reforming this house by demanding the same concessions from their leadership we must have term limitations on all committee and subcommittee chairs if real reform is going to take place even if there might be some retaliation from senior members after all real congressional reform is what the american people are expecting the simple fact is that this house isnt the possession of the politicians that inhabit it this house belongs to the people of our nation who support us with their

colleague the gentleman from illinois to completely abolish the funding i am going to explain again today why i support the crane amendment i have no quarrel with all the good things that the distinguished gentleman from illinois said about nea funding but we ought to have a ground rule around here the rule should say that we will not fund with mainstream american taxpayer money socalled

whitney museum of american art in the city of my birth the once beautiful new york city if we cannot discuss it on the floor of congress how can we possibly fund this garbage the nea used to with every dollar fund legitimate artists and worthy thespians now it funds pornography and sodomy it may only be a tiny percentage but as i told the gentleman from illinois last year this 175 million feeds the nihilistic cancer eating away at our country how can any of my colleagues at a townhall meeting defend the following i will try and figure out some way to get through this without offending the youngest child in the gallery i will do the same hosting the rush limbaugh show on monday tuesday and wednesday of next week this show reaches 20 million people 20 times more than are watching the proceedings of this chamber the whitney museum of american art in new york city received general operating funds from the nea to the tune of 200 000 over the last 2 years thus every whitney exhibit has indirect nea support this is fact now whitney currently has two exhibits one is called abject art it is designed to be foul and vile and repugnant it says in the brochures you will find this repugnant and if you do i guess then youre an art aficionado the other exhibit is called the subject of rape now here comes my painful exercise in trying to describe vaguely an exhibit indirectly funded by the nea without offending any americans abject art and this is from their brochure describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject materials such as dirt hair excrement dead animals menstrual blood and rotting food further quoting from their brochure employing methodologies adapted from feminism queer theory poststructuraism marxism and psychoanalysis i cannot read the

welcomed my ninth grandchild into the world i know what fecal stains look like drying them and framing them i do not understand why american taxpayers have to fund that garbage then there is a film by
