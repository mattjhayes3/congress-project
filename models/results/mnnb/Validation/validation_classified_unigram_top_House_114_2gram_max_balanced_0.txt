families were informed that their loved ones were to be released in the town square when the excited families arrived for their longawaited reunion their sons were hanged before their eyes a doctor

i spoke with tell me the same thing the economic sanctions and international isolation of the regime were bringing iran to the brink of revolution and this brings us to the presidents negotiation with irans fascist islamic regime any agreement between irans leaders and the united states is meaningless because irans leaders word is meaningless irans government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired to use them the only way to avert this nightmare short of war is for the regime to collapse from within over the last several years the iranian opposition has grown dramatically for two reasons there is a strong and growing perception among the iranian people that the iranian dictatorship is a pariah in the international community and the resulting international economic sanctions have created conditions that make the regimes overthrow imperative at precisely this moment in history barack obama did incalculable damage by initiating these negotiations by engaging this rogue state president obama has given it international recognition and legitimacy at just that moment when it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of its own people worse by promising relief from economic sanctions he has removed the most compelling reason the organized iranian resistance had to justify the regimes overthrow it is not the outcome of the negotiations that matters because any agreement with irans conniving leaders is meaningless it is the negotiations themselves that have greatly strengthened the regime just when it was most vulnerable from growing opposition among its own people now the house just passed h r 1191 that purports to restore congressional oversight to these talks i believe it completely missed the point first our constitution requires that any treaty be approved by twothirds of the senate well that wasnt going to happen so mr obama simply redefined the prospective treaty as an agreement between leaders an agreement with no force of law and no legal standing i fear the congress has just changed this equation by establishing a wholly extraconstitutional process that lends the imprimatur of congress to these negotiations with no practical way to stop the lifting of sanctions instead of twothirds of the senate having to approve a treaty as the constitution requires this agreement takes effect automatically unless twothirds of both houses reject ita complete sham but worse i fear this bill gives tacit approval to extremely harmful negotiations that congress instead ought to vigorously condemn and unambiguously repudiate we can only hope that in the days ahead what churchill called the parliamentary democracies will regain the national leadership required to prevent these negotiations from producing what amounts to the munich accords for the middle east that will require treating the iranian dictatorship as the international pariah that it is and it

said that a vote against tpa is a vote against international trade but actually a vote against tpa is a vote for a better construct and trade agreement i am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated strategically in the best interest of the united states economically militarily and diplomatically with the president leaving office in just months i have serious concerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have decades of implication many have said tpa will strengthen our international relationships and that may be but while tpa would fasttrack the transpacific partnership in specific currently being negotiated by the president with 11 other pacific nations i am not convinced that this is a partnership that must be done in haste before the president leaves office we currently trade with 6 of the 11 other members our vital yet delicate relationship with chinaa country not included in the transpacific partnershipwould likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic influence in the region the transpacific partnership rewards nations with serious human rights violations while slighting our faithful trade partners with shared values in europe while i support the lifting of trade barriers and promoting better standards of living i believe we must do the right track not the fast track others have claimed tpa will strengthen national security on this point we should take careful note the president has used dangerous and isolating language regarding china with words coming from the white house like hegemony and containment to ask for the tpa or the trade promotional authority but we must note that china is not our enemy therefore we should not put it on the path to become one by isolating china we could easily transform our capabilitiesbased defense strategy to a threatbased one with all of the implication and decades of effort that that would entail it would affect all of our future defense spending and could even begin cold war ii the trade promotional authority can be granted and trade agreements inked without making china excluded or worse our enemy we need to use the next 20 months to repair the relationships as we move towards better trade agreements the trade promotional authority some say gives congress a seat at the negotiating table but the tpa allows congress to set broad objectives for negotiationand that comes at a high price under the trade promotional authority congress sacrifices its authority to make any changes on the final deal and they are left with a simple yes or no vote i believe the american people deserve their voice in trade agreements which impact all of our livelihoods and affect all of our families finances and while trade is vital to economic opportunity and our international friendships i cannot support granting the president permission in light of these concerns with trade promotional authority america has long been fascinated with china from the time of columbus who sought to find a western approach to china and instead discovered america we have been drawn to its ancient culture and its people the earliest american vessel pulled into a canton port in 1748 forty years later we began free trade with the cantonese the first mention of china obtaining a favored nation status was actually as early as 1844 when we signed the treaty of wanghia the way seemed open to engage china and her market but there were concerns wrote one negotiating diplomat regarding this treaty it is the most uncivilized and remote of all nations it is in an isolated place outside the pale solitary and ignorant not only are the people entirely unversed in the forms of edicts and laws but if the meaning be rather deep they would probably not even be able to comprehend it would seem that we must make our words somewhat simple what is amusing is that the diplomat was chinese and his comments were directed toward the united states china moved ahead slowly and cautiously with its relations with the west the interplay of western covetousness with chinese reluctance kept the door to china at a mere crack european attempts to force the crack with opium and acquisition of port cities broadened the natural distrust unlike demands of europe though the united states wanted trade not territory unitedstates ambassador burlingame was able to secure the first treaty that china ever made with any western nation in 1861 and china was regarded as an equal chinese workers began to flock to the united states and literally began to move mountains in california as economic opportunity thrived unfortunately the goodwill of lincoln faded in just one generation the plundering of chinese port cities by european competitors changed how americans began to view china the flood of chinese immigrants to california became an easy target for any setback on its economic ascent equals were now called coolies racism reached such a height that in 1882 the united states congressthis bodypassed and the president signed the first ever act that excluded a specific race on immigration we did not even make any pretense about it calling it the chinese exclusion act the provisions remained in effect for nearly 60 years as these events played out commodore perry of the united states navy entered tokyo in 1850 and demanded that japan open up the japanese obliged japan embarked on a stunning modernization program where china was reluctant in an incredible span of only 50 years japan adopted western technology governance law industry and military doctrines her rise from mystic feudalism to world power alarmed the west in response the goodwill of lincoln towards china would take hold again in the form of his youthful personal secretary john hay now an older wiser and towering figure of respect serving as the secretary of state in 1900 hay saw the best way to compete with japan would be to open up china to trade while protecting her territory hays opendoor policy was widely heralded across the globe as the solution to imperial japanese ascendancy this would have longlasting implication but one important side effect was to restore unitedstates chinese relations hay even secured a guarantee from japan in 1908 to respect chinas open door independence and territory it would last only 7 years as china moved to become more enlightened to the west with sun yatsens revolution in selfgovernance in china imperial japan made what was known as the 21 demands during world war i great britain and unitedstates secretary of state william jennings bryan moved quickly to prevent japan from attempting to make china its own protectorate americanchinese relations warmed even further when the united states declared chinas right to autonomy with tariffs and trade in 1928 as oncewarm japanese relations with the united states turned sour over imperial japanese policy in china regarding manchuria america established what became the stimson doctrine which refused to recognize japanese acquisitions in china and upheld chinas rights to its own sovereignty the 1930s saw a mercurial imperial japan plunder china pull out of the league of nations and commit horrific atrocities in nanking and hong kong the unitedstates responded by calling for a global quarantine against japan in defense of china in 1937 chinas own struggles internally with mao zedongs communists paled in comparison to losing its industrial heart and its coast to the imperial japanese army by 1941 america was sending lendlease war material and economic aid to china in her defense american volunteer pilots cut dashing figures as they flew american p40 warhawks for the chinese air force as the famed flying tigers ultimately americas defense of china led it to be attacked at pearl harbor and resulted in a brutal pacific and chinese theater of war during world war ii the united states committed an entire effort in china with vinegar joe stilwell as the commanding general the building of the burma road and by training equipping and launching a chinese army to attack japanese forces immigration restrictions that were imposed in 1882 were now finally repealed america had sympathy for chinas struggle by wars end china was an important partner and ally her struggle did not end however ripped again internally by civil war once the japanese were defeated china would be led by mao zedong and the communist party the united states did not recognize communist china but neither did it materially aid fleeing nationalist chinese on the continent a period of isolation and strained relations with the united states began once again under mao in 1949 china began to arm communists in french indochina the unitedstates became embroiled in a deadly struggle with north korea and countered her assault in the south with an attack that pushed them all the way north to the yalu river on the chinese border alarmed china struck back for the first time since 1900 americans and chinese were fighting each other by 1953 an uneasy line had settled on the korean peninsula chinese relations remained cool with the west but were not always promising with the soviet russia when the unitedstates fought in vietnam china continued to arm and send troops to the communist government of ho chi minh then a series of odd events from 1969 to 1971 brought americans and chinese back to warmer relations in the most unlikely way when soviet russia attacked outposts on the northern border of china mao zedong reassessed relationships with the united states he reasoned that china could not be isolated by both world powers overtures from president nixon in his inaugural address and a series of pingpong matches created dialogue for the first time in decades in 1971 henry kissinger went on a secret mission to china opening the way for nixons visit with mao who would have thought that the man that shunned the united states in favor of communism and the president that built his reputation on fighting communism would both come to realize that our nations despite their differences needed each other mainland china was now officially recognized by the united nations the unitedstates set up diplomatic offices trade agreements opened relations warmed by the 1980s with state visits from both countries as the horizon brightened and the chinese people hoped the chinese government cracked down on dissidents in tiananmen square the unitedstates alarmed imposed sanctions and restrictions tensions loomed through the 1990s culminating with the unitedstates bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade serbia in 1999 during the kosovo campaign calmer heads prevailed and tensions eased by 2001 trade restrictions were loosened once again china pledged a deep commitment to fight the war on terror and committed material aid in great amounts for the effort by 2006 chinaunitedstates relations deepened under the strategic economic dialogue business in both countries increased as commerce offered great economic opportunity for both countries on the verge of a bright future we now see today with timidity and fear where we should see opportunity and favor with regard to china china needs us and we need china yet we see in the last week a week of a barrage of negative press on china covering everything from hedging them on trade to condemning them and their development of island outposts in the china sea to framing them up as the new military threat that must be checked by the united states dialogue and diplomacy are cheaper than tanks and tomahawks does the united states really wish to believe that we can leave a capabilitiesbased military to create some new threatbased military and it would be in our favor while china is not our enemy we could certainly set the conditions to make them one in the future it would be a tragic mistake it would devour our diplomacy drain our defense and diminish our domestic priorities worse it could set the course for some future horrific conflict between dozens of friendly nations that we currently trade with including chinaincluding china where is the dialogue on including china in the transpacific partnership i have not heard it from this chamber or the white house sure we claim they can join if they meet the standard only after we use every antichinese statement in trying to make the case for the trade promotion authority that is not very reassuring some say we must not include china at all in the transpacific partnership because of their human rights record others object because they are a communist nation others cite the fact that china has been our former enemy well here are some thoughts to ponder if we can forgive germany and japan for horrific human rights violations in world war ii can we not reach out to china if we can embrace former enemies who reformed their existing communist governments such as vietnam can we not reach out to china if we can turn former enemies such as great britain canada mexico spain the philippines germany austria hungary italy japan and vietnam into our top trading partners can we not also reach out to china china needs petroleum and natural gas

china constitutes our greatest trading partner working with thousands of businesses that bolster our economy and better our quality of life our peoples are historically and deeply intertwined we must proceed with wisdom and caution while we love trade and while we love economy we can work out differences rather than magnify them and deepen suspicion and concern instead we can dialogue the same

the 1980s yet we no longer have those concerns about those allies today with their incredible effort economy and technology our peoples are historically and deeply entwined the united states and china and we must work hard to maintain that i would hope that our colleagues and our president would temper the rhetoric with regard to discussions on trade and using it as some new effort to hedge or

word is meaningless irans government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired to use them the only way to avert this nightmare short of war is for the regime to collapse from within over the last several years the iranian opposition has grown dramatically for two reasons there is a strong and growing perception among the iranian people that the iranian dictatorship is a pariah in the international community and the resulting international economic sanctions have created conditions that make the regimes overthrow imperative at precisely this moment in history barack obama did incalculable damage by initiating these negotiations by engaging this rogue state president obama has given it international recognition and legitimacy at just that moment when it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of its own people worse by promising relief from economic sanctions he has removed the most compelling reason the organized iranian resistance had to justify the regimes overthrow it is not the outcome of the negotiations that matters because any agreement with irans conniving leaders is meaningless it is the negotiations themselves that have greatly strengthened the regime just when it was most vulnerable from growing opposition among its own people now the house just passed h r 1191 that purports to restore congressional oversight to these talks i believe it completely missed the point first our constitution requires that any treaty be approved by twothirds of the senate well that wasnt going to happen so mr obama simply redefined the prospective treaty as an agreement between leaders an agreement with no force of law and no legal standing i fear the congress has just changed this equation by establishing a wholly extraconstitutional process that lends the imprimatur of congress to these negotiations with no practical way to stop the lifting of sanctions instead of twothirds of the senate having to approve a treaty as the constitution requires this agreement takes effect automatically unless twothirds of both houses reject ita complete sham but worse i fear this bill gives tacit approval to extremely harmful negotiations that congress instead ought to vigorously condemn and unambiguously repudiate we can only hope that in the days ahead what churchill called the parliamentary democracies will regain the national leadership required to prevent these negotiations from producing what amounts to the munich accords for the middle east that will require treating the iranian dictatorship as the international pariah that it is and it will require providing every ounce of moral and material support to the iranian opposition that they need to rid their nation of this fascist islamic dictatorship to restore their proud heritage and to retake their place among the civilized nations of the world"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a satellite flying in space over the

launched missiles for decades the rogue nations of iran and north korea have been working together since the 1980s on missile development during the 1990s they started developing longrange ballistic

iran has the ability to attack israel these longrange missiles are intended for the united states the american people should understand the threat we face we should be prepared our nation must
