weeks ago the house republican leadership took a special order to point out the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call

premium increase is not expected to be more than 4 per month in 1990 and no more than 10 20 per month in 1993 the surtax which goes into effect in 1989 is estimated to be paid only by 40 percent of the beneficiaries with the highest income levels and that is scaled based on income amounts in exchange medicare beneficiaries will have unlimited hospitalization after satisfaction of a single annual

of both bodies wanted to approve a cpb authorization bill with more realistic funding numbers that would not be vetoed by the president after extensive discussions among the administration and house and senate members a compromise package was assembled that is contained in the substitute before the house this package has already been approved by the senate if the house approves it as well the office of management and budget has agreed not to recommend a presidentiai veto thus the house has a historic opportunity to appove and to have enacted the first cpb authorizing legislaton in this decade legislation that will mandate prudent funding levels and increased reliance by public broadcasting stations on nonfederal sources of funding first and foremost h r 4118 as amended by this substitute will drastically reduce the funding ceilings proposed in the original house and senate authorization bills three examples will illustrate just how significant those cuts are first the new authorization level for fiscal 1991 245 millionwill be only 2 million over the approximately 243 million already appropriated by congress nearly 10 million less than the existing fiscal 1990 authorization of 254 million and nearly 60 million less than the 304 million originally proposed second the new fiscal year 1993 funding level 285 millionwill be about 20 million less than the 404 million originally proposed and even about 20 million less than the funds originally proposed by this legislation for fiscal 1991 304 million third the authorized funding increases are only 20 million for each of the 3 years as opposed to 50 million originally this legislation also requires public broadcasting stations to rely more heavily on private instead of federal funding now for every 2 privately raised by public broadcasting stations 1 can be received from the federal government this is termed the 2toi or 50 percent matching fund h r 4118 changes the matching fund ratio to require public stations to raise 2 50 in private funds before they could receive 1 from cpb this new 2 to1 or 40 percent matching fund is a return to the ratio contained originally in the public broadcasting act of 1967 it also reflects the fact that public broadcasting has never been in better financial health according to a cpb report the total income of public broadcasting in fiscal year 1987 grew 14 percent to about 1 30 billion the same report states that private funding increased by nearly 11 percent to over 1 billion given the fiancial health of the public system adjustment of the matching fund ratio should be actively considered as part of each cpb authorization process we hope this adjustment serves as the starting point of a debate about the proper ratio of pdvatetofederal funding support should be as public broadcasting moves into the 21st century finally this bill mandates greater accountability ovo the extra 200 million authorized for the stitellite interconnection fund specifically cpb and the public stations must report to congress in 1990 on the final satellite system selected whether it would be more costeffective to lease transponder capacity rather than to purchase a new satellite and whother private funds are available to public broadcasting that could be used instead of the public money authorized through this legislation we applaud this amendment cpb is authorized nearly 1 billion between fiscal years 1991 and 1993 through this bill in return gpb should at least be required to exhaust every possible avenue to use nonfederal funds and attempt to lighten the burden on the taxpayers as much as possible this provision is not a new or radical concept in public broadcasting it is only an extension of the partnership of public and private funding embodied in all public broadcasting funding through devices like the matching fund which are designed to give public stations the incentive to rely on nonfederal funds for years congress engaged in a sleight of hand game with public broadcasting funding that should be the envy of card sharps everywhere with one hand we authorized great sums of money for public broadcasting with the other hand we appropriated only a small sum more than the previous year by now the game is old hat and a comfortable fiction of all concerned unfortunately the game has done real harm to the public broadcasting system because it kept public broadcastings mission and funding locked in the past instead of moving toward the future these disproportionate authorizations only delayed responsible debate on how the public broadcasting system can grow without further infusions of taxpayer dollars in the grammrudmanhollings era when many more essential programs are frozen or limited to small increases both sides know that any significant expansion in federal fundng for public broadcasting is not possible the public broadcasting act described federal funding of public broadcasting programming as seed money that was necessary because sufficient federal funds were not avalatle it is clear that those seeds have borne fruit and that requests for increased authorizations should be evaluated much more carefully yet the authorization game continued and appeared to be nearly impossible to stop now at long last the game appears to be"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "1 year ago yesterday this house

the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this

amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all
