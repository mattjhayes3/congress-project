following 9 11 and more than 2 200 missions in response to katrina these pilots led an aviation disaster response second only to that of the unitedstates military but providing a coordinated aviation response during national emergencies is only a part of the underlying mission for most nonprofit volunteer organizations their most common mission is to provide emergency medical transportation services for needy families each year volunteer pilots transport hundreds of people with lifethreatening illnesses thousands of miles in order to receive specialized medical attention as well as transporting patients in remote locations who would otherwise be unable to receive care yet despite the importance of their mission these organizations have been left out of the volunteer protection act in its current form this legislation addressds this mission by amending the volunteer protection act to include organizations such as angel flight so they may continue to fulfill their mission and provide a critical service for needy families seeking specialized medical attention it is important to note that i have worked closely with congressman scott to ensure that this legislation does not shield pilots from liability in instances of criminal misconduct or gross negligence instead this legislation provides nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations the security they need to grow and expand

and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our civilian population as the greatest generation did as other generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves this earth as others

emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale to me on the ground in iraq what a patriot as he says

that fanaticism in religion is not good for the world it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or what is politically correct fanaticism does lead to holy wars

and acknowledge the threat we want our president to go to the united nations and say we cant appease other countries we have to stand behind security for all and freedom for people and liberty

each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable regardless of whether we agree or not i have got to tell you what the president of venezuela did in this country yesterday was dishonorable it dishonored his nation it dishonors the people of his nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere

owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are standing up all those who are rising up against american

congressional district and you do not condemn my president if there is any criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us

there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank

foreign relations testified before congress we need to khow whats in the box more than we need to know who is moving them around a container yard so if our concern truly is port security why are we not focusing on supporting that overall effort the fact is that dubai ports world is of course involved with the jebel ali port one of the largest and among the most advanced ports in the world

still it seems that its not enough i would ask what more would we have dpw do when will this be dead enough to satisfy the unitedstates congress the action i am sad to say sends exactly the wrong message to the world about the climate for international businesses in the united states it sends the wrong message about our willingness to engage in transactions that create growth and jobs here at

earmarks they have sacrificed 1 billion worth of earmarks in order to do the things that i outlined before to do more education to do more health research to do more community health centers so this is something that all of us are taking part in trying to serve the needs of the american people as effectively as possible this is a lot of money 142 5 billion and this literally is the peoples bill i want to point out to my friends on the other side that when the republicans became the majority party this bill was 69 billion today it is 142 billion more than double what it was in 1994 that is pretty substantial dedication to education to health research to a whole host of things i would point out in the last 10 years we have increased title i aid to disadvantaged students by 91 percent we have increased special education by 380 percent that is a dramatic increase i think it is great that we and i want to say historically that has had strong bipartisan support that we care about people who have needs i was once an elementary principal in a public school and we did not have any special education program that was the problem of the families today we have billions of dollars spent on these programs that is a credit to america that people do care about each other and it is demonstrated by the support we have for idea with an increase of 380 percent that has been bipartisan we have tripled the federal funding for reading programs i think we are more and more aware that learning to read early in your education experience is vitally important today we are faced within the united states with a dropout rate of over 30 percent that is a terrible waste of human talent one of the things that causes that i think isinadequate reading programs early on we are trying to address that problem we have addressed that problem we are also recognizing in thisbill that the key to a good public education system is a good teacher a good principal a good superintendent caring people so we put in this bill some additional money to recruit and retrain quality public school teachers and principals parents who have worked with principals in the school system know how important that is pell grants we have gone up 64 percent in the last 10 years again we want to help those students who want to get an education who have limited economic resources to get an opportunity to participate in the american dream we have done this with americas historically black colleges we have increased their funding 182 percent that is a dramatic commitment on the part of the federal government all in all i think we as congress can take some pride this is not the back of the bus when you spend 142 billion anything but this is a frontrow seat and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be in that frontrow seat on the education bus on the health research bus on the labor department programs for job retraining bus i think this is a bill we can take pride in my colleagues on my side since we cannot get any help from our friends on the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take in our accomplishments since we became a majority since 1994 as i have outlined and particularly in the last 10 years this is a bill that is responsible it is a bill that reflects good management of resources it is a bill that we should all support strongly i hope my colleagues on the majority side will come in and vote in a positive way to increase education

brazil to participate in a study trip to help strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two countries during our time there we met with top brazilian negotiators to discuss key trade issues that we expect will be addressed next week in hong kong at our meetings my colleagues and i drove one critical message and that is our governments unwavering commitment to the utilization and protection of our trade remedy laws there is no doubt the unitedstates employers rely on these laws which serve as a fundamental line of defense an opportunity to police our markets against unfair trade and to preserve domestic industries that otherwise would be at risk there is no question that it is the responsibility of congress and the administration to ensure that our firms have the proper tools to fight illegally traded goods and services while we are committed to opening our markets and have done so historically reducing tradedistorting subsidies and eliminating nontariff barriers to trade we are not willing to give up appropriate tools that we have to police our market for illegally traded imports to reinforce this i introduced a resolution h res 577 calling on unitedstates negotiators to stand firm in the face of international pressure and uphold our trade remedy laws during the wtos doha development agenda round many in the doha round particularly the socalled friends of antidumping negotiations have targeted unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty measures as distortions to trade they claim they are antifree trade and yet the fact remains that our participation in a free trading system is contingent on our ability to have access to these remedies these laws as i said are the last line of defense and eliminating or weakening them is not a solution to making sure that they work appropriately nor is in this political climate in congress weakening or watering down the ability of the unitedstates to utilize its appropriate trade remedy laws in any way a viable position the time has come for congress to draw a line in the sand and take a much tougher stance with our trading partners to ensure that they fully abide by the rulesbased global trading system we will not stand by and let other countries try to use negotiations to undermine the intent of our domestic trade remedy laws america will no longer tolerate unfair trading practices at the expense of our workers our trade laws have a fundamental purpose and are used only when others break the rules congress will not allow this last line of defense to be compromised in any way and our negotiators need to recognize that my resolution will make very clear what our position is and in the process fend off any attempts to derail our trade laws and put the house on record

package as we move to a final package and as we move closer to the trade talks in hong kong which we hope will be successful we must carefully monitor the progress of the doha round and specifically the rules negotiations to ensure that we do not resign ourselves to agreements that would in any other way impede american producers from policing the domestic market this is a fundamental issue for a

progress and proud of our current record of equality i am here to report to my colleagues in the house that the voting rights act has worked in my state and now it is time to modernize the law to deal with the problems of today not yesteryear it is true when the voting rights act was first passed in 1965 georgia needed federal intervention to correct decades of discrimination now 41 years later

african american representation in the state legislature closely mirrors their representation in georgias population but dont just take my word for it on georgias progress listen to this ringing endorsement from my colleague from georgia congressman john lewis an icon of the civil rights movement under oath in federal court 5 years ago congressman lewis testified there has been a transformation its a different state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the

simply never be forgiven that georgians must eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of todays new voting problems the voting rights act represents a grand trophy of great accomplishment for congress but after 41 years the trophy

completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank goodness that men and women in uniform will volunteer to go serve and carry out this tough mission and extend liberty from one generation to the next these are difficult days america needs to pull together i want to yield to my colleagues that have come tonight two of the people i respect the most in the house first the gentlewoman from north carolina e 1830 virginia foxx is a new member but you would never know it because she has got tons of experience and she has been down here standing up for what she believes day in and day out i want to yield to her on this most important issue of global security"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as stewards of hardworking americans tax dollars we cannot ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos like the rest of my colleagues joining me today i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life but to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector president bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive governmentfunded research nearly 4 years ago in these 4 years government and private research on those stem cells have produced nothing cured no one and there is no indication that that will change in the meantime ethical research not derived from embryos in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases the private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood in adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research we do have the power of the purse and we cannot misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life"]]}
