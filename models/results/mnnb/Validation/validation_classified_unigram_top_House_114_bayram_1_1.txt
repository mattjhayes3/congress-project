fact the innovation act it is one of the worst misnomers that i have seen in my time in congress this should be called the antiinnovation act this is yet the latest of a decadeslong attack on the patent rights of the american people that were placed into the constitution by our founding fathers for decades now large multinational corporations very powerful economic entities that have influence on government have been trying to neuter the patent rights of the american people why have they been doing this why do they want to eliminate or to dramatically reduce the rights of our inventors to control what they have invented because these are big guys who dont want to pay the little guys when they steal from them the fact is that our founding fathers knew it was important for someone who has created something whether it is a writer or an inventor to have the right to control his or her creation for a certain period of time the time period has been 17 years traditionally since the time of our constitution our founding fathers knew this was important to our countrys wellbeing not just in terms of the rights of the individual which we agree with as americans and which were written into our constitution as part of the bill of rights only one place is the word right used in the body of the constitution and that is in the section dealing with providing our inventors and yes our writers with the right to control what they have created for a certain period of time in order to profit from it our big corporations and these multinational corporations that have no loyalty to the united states these people who are continually going overseas to china and elsewhere are trying to neuter this so that they can take any new innovation without having to pay the person who has actually been the inventor and created this that is totally contrary to what our country has been all about we have had the strongest patent system in the worldthe strongest in the world what has that

resources there are countries all over the world where people work hard and have natural resources it is our freedom and our respect for the individual rights of our citizens that have given us

they werent given by the patent office and issued frivolous lawsuits to people to try to get them to pay money to them they are called patent trolls this excuse for changing our patent system is a

time specifically when an employer makes an acrosstheboard distribution of voting stock the value of the grant would not be counted as an employees taxable income provided that the same number of shares is granted to every employee and the stock is held for five years if held for ten years employee stockholders can begin to sell or exchange a portion of their stock for other similarlypriced

covered by these plans are what are called o c lands which are managed by a very unique federal statute called the o c act that law calls for sustainable timber production and revenue to local counties it is different than the other forest laws now despite that clear mandate in federal law the blms proposal would allow for harvesting on about 22 percent is all 22 percent of the land base it would lock up the remainder in various reserves oregons forested counties some of which have more than 70 percent of their land controlled by the federal government rely on receipts from federal timber projects to fund basic needs like law enforcement schools and other essential services unfortunately under blms proposal these counties would receive an estimated 27 percent is all of their historical average receipt27 percent now while the blms proposed plans fall far short of meeting these communities needs it seems the agency is determined to push forward anyway with these plans in a

years ago today in 1954 four gunmen entered the house chamber and they opened fire they wounded five members of our body as you know you can still see a bullet hole in the desk on the floor and where they hit the ceiling of our chamber and on this day in 1971 a bomb exploded in the capitol in a senate bathroom no one was hurt but it was a shock that another act of such violence could happen here in both instances and every day since our capitol police sacrifice and put their lives on the line to protect our visitors members and staff here in the peoples house it can be easy to forget the importance and the quiet vigilance from those who keep us safe our capitol police officers go unappreciated too often every day but especially today we should take some time and thank them for

predecessor former north carolina 10th district congressman cass ballenger up until 2005 congressman ballenger represented the 10th district of north carolina in the united states house of representatives during that time he served as chairman of the house subcommittee on workforce protections where he authored groundbreaking legislation that improved workplace safety and created the opportunity for employers and regulators to be partners not adversaries in protecting the health and safety of workers as chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee on the international relations committee he took on the daunting and often thankless task of fighting to promote democracy and defend human rights in central and south american nations he did this not only for the sake of justice in those countries but also to protect the interests of the united states his personal commitment to serving his constituents is a legendary example that i strive every day to follow i was the beneficiary of his kind and gracious nature when i was elected to represent the 10th district in 2005 after his decision to retire from the house he personally provided me with guidance and assistance that immeasurably helped me as a new member of congress and ensured continuity of our quality constituent services for western north carolina in his personal and professional life cass placed others before himself he was a part of the greatest generation he fought in world war ii and returned home to go to college he started a family and joined his fathers business in box manufacturing he told his father that boxes were a thing of the past and the wave of the future was plastics it is almost like it was george bailey coming home to say that as a county commissioner in catawba county he was one of the first republicans elected after the civil war now at this date catawba county is one of the most republican counties in the state of north carolina he led the way to establish the catawba valley community college and catawba valley medical center as a legislator in the north carolina general assembly he authored the states first meaningful open meetings law and was named most effective republican legislator by the north carolina institute of government it would take volumes to talk about all of the philanthropic work of congressman ballenger and his wife donna but they are responsible for countless schools day care centers hospitals and disaster responses in the united states and central and south america as well personally cass was the ultimate character he could tell you a great story a great joke and tell you off and you would laugh at everything he said in addition to being one of the most distinguished members of the house and the north carolina republican delegation generally congressman ballenger was also very colorful there are great moments here on the house floor that we can point to anyone who spent any time with him knew that he was affable kind and brutally honest he would tell you exactly what he was thinking and generally with a hilarious delivery he was one of the few people who could hold someone accountable in the most blistering way possible make you laugh and also help you out of a tight spot all in one conversation he was a rare person indeed and he will be missed i ask my colleagues to join with me in a moment of silence on

are bringing forward to shut down the government we are bringing something forward to fund it for the next 3 weeks while we continue to work on a process of getting stuff done again i agree with my colleagues we are trying to fight we had to work on the 529 plan that frankly the administration had some issues with we fixed that here in the house this week we are working on the problems that matter to kitchen tables around this country republicans are doing that but they are also standing up for what we learned in civics lessons is that this is the way the legislative process works if i just need to repeat it one more time lets go through it once more january 14 the house did its job it approved a fullyear spending bill february 3 senate democrats voted to block consideration february 4 senate democrats vote again to block consideration february 5 senate democrats vote a third time to block consideration againas we will go along as you know february 23 same story three times fourth time removed democrats even prevented themselves from offering amendments to strip language they found offensive i guess after so many years of not being able to offer amendments they

entirely different way nothing is more apparent in this situation than where the unitedstates army corps of engineers grants themselves one way of complying with wetlands regulations yet they impose an entirely different standard upon our private citizens the unitedstates army corps of engineers and the epa go out and purport to be defenders of wetlands good stewards of our wetlands yet the greatest cause of wetlands loss in the united states is actually caused by historic current and future actions of the unitedstates army corps of engineers in our home state of louisiana we have lost over 1 900 square miles of our coast and the majority of that land loss has been caused by the management or the mismanagement by the unitedstates army corps of engineers of our coastal resources and the river resources particularly the mississippi river what this amendment does is it simply requires that the unitedstates army corps of engineers comply with the same standards as anything else if there are permits required they have to get them if there are mitigation requirements they have to get them they can no longer mismanage our coastal resources this isnt a parochial this is an issue whereby the nation truly benefits from this this is the area where fishery production occurs energy production occurs we literally power this nations economy and we feed american families so this

foreign government or an individual trying to influence the political process of this country it is bad enough that domestic money reigns so supremely essentially what the majority here wants to do is
