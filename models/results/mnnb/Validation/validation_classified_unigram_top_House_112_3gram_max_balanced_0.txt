this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre not going to change the middle east no matter what you want to do or hope to do or pray to do you cant do it and you wont do it beside me are two little girls one named eden and one named stephanie they are at the graveside of their father sergeant kenneth bladuf sergeant in the united states marine corps about 2 months ago he was sent to afghanistan along with a colonel benjamin palmer from cherry point marine corps air station which is in my district also one night when they were having dinner with the afghan trainees one of the trainees pulled out a pistol and killed both of them it is so ironic that the day before sergeant bladuf was killed he had emailed his wife and he said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them and yet we keep

implications of burdensome regulations that have the potential to overwhelm my states and countrys job creators a current effort by the department of labor is a new standard being considered by the occupational safety and health administration called the injury and illness prevention program or 12p2 the standard will require all employers to implement safety and health programs to find and fix all hazards in their workplace even those not otherwise regulated this regulation could potentially impact every employer covered by osha unless osha exempts small employers or those with less hazardous workplaces many employers who voluntarily issued safety and health programs have improved their workplaces safety culture but there are serious problems about this standard that osha has not addressed the moment this regulation gets issued safety and health programs will go from being a good idea to a legal requirement which means employers will have to meet oshas standards rather than what works best for them and their employees and what is indicated as best in best practices osha will have the authority to come in and secondguess an employer about how well they have implemented their program not surprisingly then job creators see the 12p2 regulation as just another osha enforcement tool rather than something that will help them enhance their safety practices but theyre not the only ones a recent rand study found that californias 12p2 regulation which has been in place since 1991 has not prevented workplace fatalities and barely made a dent in total injury prevention many job creators are worried that osha will double dip on citations issuing one citation for a hazard and another citation because the safety and health program failed to detect and correct the hazard talk about double jeopardy finally another problem is whether employers will be required to find and fix ergonomics hazards the clinton administration issued an ergonomic regulation in 2000 that was shot down thankfully by congress osha will soon hold a small business panel to ask job creators across the country their opinion and insight on 12p2 i hope the obama administration against its pattern listens to the concerns of these business owners instead of imposing a costly regulation that we have proof will not improve worker safety imposing a new and costly safety and health program standard will only serve to increase osha enforcement with no visible improvement to worker safety and safe health as ronald reagan once said it is not my intention to do away with government it is rather to make it work for us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back its my hope we remain committed to this principle and ensure that regulations ensure both productivity and job

throughout the world and they are called the peace corps volunteers the peace corps started as an idea of president kennedy back in 1960 when he spoke to the university of michigan and encouraged those students to volunteer to help america abroad finally in 1961 he started the peace corps since then over 200 000 americans mainly young people mainly females have volunteered to go around the world representing the united states it is very hard work being a peace corps volunteer they deal with issues that most americans never deal with just simple basic necessities such as of electricity and water and matters such as that they do without or they are difficult to find in the remote areas where they are because they are helping other people that dont have those things we have in the united states generally they work alone when they are in foreign countries but all is not well with the peace corps because during the time since president kennedy started the peace corps and those wonderful people go overseas many times those volunteers those young americans become victims of crime in these foreign countries and when they become victims of crime in some cases our own country

since this crime against her has occurred she joined the peace corps in 2004 on her first day as a peace corps volunteer in bangladesh a group of men started sexually groping her as she was walking to the house that she was to live in but no one in the peace corps did anything about this assault she told the peace corps staff over and over again that she felt unsafe in bangladesh and the situation she was in but the peace corps didnt do anything months later she came in contact with the same men who then kidnapped her they beat her they sexually assaulted her but they werent through they abandoned her and threw her in an alley somewhere in bangladesh and no one did anything according to jess the peace corps did everything they could to cover this up because they seemed to be more worried about americas relationship with bangladesh than they were about this american volunteer that was assaulted a victim of crime jess says that the peace corps not only didnt do anything they blamed her for the conduct of others they blamed her for being a sexual assault victim a rape victim is never to be blamed for the crime that is committed against her it is the fault of the criminal offender whether it occurs in the united states or abroad we need to understand that these precious people who go overseas and represent us somewhere in the world when a crime is committed against them we need to take their side we need to be supportive of those individuals and we dont assume they did anything wrong because they did not do anything wrong when they became a victim of crime they were just victims of crime and the person that should be held accountable is the criminal and not to blame the victim rape is never the fault of the victim it is always the fault of the perpetrator but jess got no satisfaction from the peace corps no one did anything when she got home she was told to tell other people that she was coming back to the united states for medical reasons to have her wisdom teeth pulled not for the sexual assault that was committed against her this was jesss case a few others were brought to light recently by abc news and 20 20 and now more and more of these peace

every american on the street should we balance our budget they will nod their head if you ask them again should we force congress to balance the budget again they will nod their head and say yes this is something we should do there is common agreement across the american people because its common sense its hard to explain to any family or any business why they have to balance their budget but congress does not it is the ultimate exemption for members of congress that they can spend as much as they want as often as they would like without any retribution i hear all the doomsday statements that if we balanced our budget what would possibly happen if we had to live within our means it makes me smile and say just like every business and every family we have to make hard choices and we have to do it but its not what doomsday prediction happens if we balance our budget it is look up across the ocean at what is happening in europe right now to nations that did not balance their budget and for some reason we think as americans we can run up as much debt as we would like with no consequence we are fooling ourselves the doomsday is coming we must put a boundary around the united states congress to be able to balance our budget in 1995 when this failed by one vote we will forever regret that if this occurs again its time for us to balance our budget once and for all"], [0.5,

privilege and the honor to visit our wounded at walter reedbethesda it so happened that five marines from camp lejeune marine corps base in my district were there four of the five had lost both legsdouble amputees and the one kid that had his leg blown off by an ied i went into his room as i did the other four but this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre not going to change the middle east no matter what you want to do or hope to do or pray to do you cant do it and you wont do it beside me are two little girls one named eden and one named stephanie they are at the graveside of their father sergeant kenneth bladuf sergeant in the united states marine corps about 2 months ago he was sent to afghanistan along with a colonel benjamin palmer from cherry point marine corps air station which is in my district also one night when they were having dinner with the afghan trainees one of the trainees pulled out a pistol and killed both of them it is so ironic that the day before sergeant bladuf was killed he had emailed his wife and he said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them and yet we keep spending 10 billion a month were going to cut programs from senior citizens and children in america we cant balance the budget but old mr karzai hell get his 10 billion a month the congress needs to look at this and start bringing our troops home before 2014 also in sundays paper it says suicide bomber hits nato bus 17 people including 12 americans are killed in the deadliest attack since the war began i hope that we dont have to continue to go to walter reedbethesda and see all of these broken bodies if were going to be there until 2014 there are going to be a lot more broken bodies and dead young men and women i hope the leadership of both parties will start joining those of us in both parties and bring our troops home before 2014 again i state to all the children like eden and stephanie be proud of your moms and your dads but for those of us who are policymakers we have the responsibilitynot the generals but we the policymakersof sending our young men and women to die and lose their limbs for absolutely nothing but a corrupt leader i will close right now with the same closing i do all the time god please bless our men and women in uniform please bless the families of our men and women in uniform god in your loving arms hold the families who have given a child dying for freedom in afghanistan and iraq god please bless the house and senate that we will do what is right in your eyes please bless president obama that he will do what is right in your eyes for his people and three times i will say god please god please god please continue to bless america"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a failure of leadership his own words thank you
