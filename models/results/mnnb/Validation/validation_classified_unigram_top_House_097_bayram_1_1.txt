to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by

section 2405 out of the bill it is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to

established a national pattern of fish conservation which previously had been lacking the national advisory committee on oceans and atmosphere nacoa recently reported that foreign fishing within the

letters from her husband was she sentenced to 1 year or 2 years for this terrible crime of receiving a letter from her husband no the helsinki commission in washington has learned that mrs rudenko was been sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment this treatment is unbelievable and again i find it indicative of the soviet attitude toward the helsinki accords the rudenkos are but two of the millions who have suffered in ukraine but their sense of honor in bringing to light human rights violations separate them from many of their countrymen many americans find it difficult to comprehend the lifethreatening danger of being a member of the ukrainian helsinki group every single member of the group has been imprisoned or sent out of their own country one has even committed suicide we are here today to ask the soviet government some tough questions why do you persecute men and women who are simply monitoring an international agreement signed by the soviet union how much longer will these violations of human rights continue does the soviet government think the entire world is blind to the inhumane treatment of ukrainian citizens more importantly we salute today the members of the ukrainian helsinki group for 5 long years they have suffered for their countrymen the free nations of the world appreciate all that they have done and hope beyond measure that they will not be marking

in urging congress to bestow honorary citizenship upon raoul wallenberg mr wallenberg displayed extraordinary heroism in assisting tens of thousands of jews to freedom from nazioccupied hungary late in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his soul to rest in peace regardless of his fate i am both proud and honored to join with my colleagues in asking the congress of the united states to bestow honorary citizenship upon raoul wallenberg"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5,

result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the

that this attempt would be made to lay the blame for deficits on republican presidents when during that entire period of time with the exception of 2 brief periods control of both houses of congress

is one section section 2405 that should not become law by virtue of this bill comning up under suspension an amendment cannot be offered by myself or others who feel likewise to amend section 2405 out of the bill it is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to prepare for when

pattern of fish conservation which previously had been lacking the national advisory committee on oceans and atmosphere nacoa recently reported that foreign fishing within the unitedstates fishery
