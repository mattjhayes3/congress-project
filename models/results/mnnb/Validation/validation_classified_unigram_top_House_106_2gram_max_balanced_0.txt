languish in kosovo or those in bosnia and other fellow citizens scattered throughout the world on various deployments we should also consider the cost of these deployments both in dollars and in reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian government indicate that 93 percent of the population of kosovo is ethnic albanians now and 5 percent serbs in essence american troons rre in kosovo to protect the serbs from an angry majority this makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the kosovo operation costs 3 billion last year and the estimate for fy 2000 is about 2 billion our peacekeeping operation in the balkans is approaching 20 billion in total expenses in reading a heritage

in kosovo and bosnia this means that we have not met our goals for modernizing our weaponry because of our peacekeeping operations in the balkans by making bosnia and kosovo safer for their citizens

attack by the communist chinese on taiwan was the briefing they got and these dod documents verify this that they were shown how the military can use civilian airfields to conduct military operations

problems face this country and certainly face our administration one of those problems is keeping social security solvent this affects everybody not only existing retirees but the young middle age and future generations what is going to be their future in terms of working and paying taxes and maybe or maybe not getting social security benefits when they retire social security probably is one of this countrys most successful programs in terms of helping people retire with some security when we started social security in 1935 when franklin roosevelt decided we should have a program to force savings and pay for some disability insurance while you are working rather than risk the poor house at that time there were something like 52 workers for each social security retiree remember it is a payasyougo program existing current workers pay in their social security tax and that tax immediately goes out to pay benefits for existing retirees by the time we got to 1940 there were 38 people working paying in their taxes for every one retiree this year we have three people working three people working paying in their taxes to cover each retirees benefits a couple of things have happened politicians in this chamber the senate and the presidents decided to increase benefits over the yearsbecause it was popular when there was not enough money they increased taxes and borrowing by 2025 over on the far righthand side of this chart you see there are only going to be two workers paying in their taxes for each retiree we started out back in 1940 having a 3 percent tax on the first 1 500 of wages today we have increased that to 12 4 percent on the first almost 76 000 of wages so i hope we all agree one of our challenges is not to increase taxes yet again demographics of longer life span and lower birth rates have also greatly affected solvency the diminishing return on our social security investment should concern us all the real return of social security is less than 2 percent for the average worker in the united states again not counting the amount of the social security tax that pays for the disability insurance portion workers get a real return of less than 2 percent on the taxes paid in for some there is zero return on their social security they are never going to live long enough to get back what they and their employer put into it but still 1 9 percent is the average minorities do not get back what they pay in a young black male for example is going live on the average 62 years that means they pay in all of their life but do not get benefits but the average real return for the market is over 7 percent part of the solution for social security has got to be a better return on the investment this chart shows the number of years you are going to have to live after retirement to get back the money that you and your employer paid in just to break even if you were lucky enough to retire in 1940 it took 2 months if you retired 5 years ago in 1995 you are going to have to live 16 years after retirement to break even on average if you retire in 2005 2015 or 2025 it is unlikely you are going to ever get back what you put into this system even a c d or extra safe investments in the marketplace would give more to retirees governor bush is suggesting limitations on any such investments it can only be used for retirement purposes it has to be limited to safe investments we have companies now that will guarantee a return greater than social security without taking any risks so our challenge is we have to get people this congress the president to develop legislation to save social security it is easy to put off the fixing to the next generation or future congresses vice president gore has suggested adding giant ious that demand increasing taxes later the last president should have dealt with the problem the next president should not put oft solutions that will keep social security solvent for the next 75 years right now

anniversary of the agreement providing for the withdrawal of yugoslavian troops from kosovo and the deployment of international peacekeeping forces it is vital that we not forget the american troops who continue to languish in kosovo or those in bosnia and other fellow citizens scattered throughout the world on various deployments we should also consider the cost of these deployments both in dollars and in reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian government indicate that 93 percent of the population of kosovo is ethnic albanians now and 5 percent serbs in essence american troons rre in kosovo to protect the serbs from an angry majority this makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the kosovo operation costs 3 billion last year and the estimate for fy 2000 is about 2 billion our peacekeeping operation in the balkans is approaching 20 billion in total expenses in reading a heritage foundation report on this issue i discovered that the pentagon believes that it missed its procurement targets for the past 5 years because of unexpected costs associated with the military operations in kosovo and bosnia this means that we have not met our goals for modernizing our weaponry because of our peacekeeping operations in the balkans by making bosnia and kosovo safer for their citizens we have made america less safe for our citizens is that really the policy results this administration is seeking congress must take steps to ensure that americas national security interests are

know if they went to columbine or not so i called ross his wife paloma answered the phone and said they did not go there that ross wanted to talk to me ross who is a successful stockbroker out there had come home earlier to hug his children and to meet them in the driveway as they went rushing out to see their dad and embrace they did not go to columbine but their friends did as recently as sunday david had been playing basketball with kids from columbine as i called them last night they did not know if their friends were victims or survivors the sadness the confusion the overwhelming frustration and anguish was just too much for them as we talked on the phone last night i think both of us had tears in our eyes we do not know the easy solutions the quick answers the tendency in

the very same time that secretary cohen was speaking in shanghai chinese dictator jiang zemin was speaking to a gathering of elite unitedstates corporate chairmen who were in china to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the communist takeover of the mainland of china jiang zemin blatantly renewed threats by the communist regime to conquer taiwan by force and then he threatened the united states we will not allow any foreign force to create or support taiwanese independence i have in my possession pentagon documents detailing the clinton administrations exchange program between the united states and communist china it is a military exchange program this program of military exchanges has in effect assisted the communist chinese air force in improving its capabilities to conduct bombing raids on taiwan the may 1999 air force exchange and this was an exchange in may of 1999 this year introduced the communist chinese and these are military leaders in the communist chinese military to our most advanced air force capabilities this may eventually cause the death of americans serving in any unitedstates air or naval forces that would attempt to defend taiwan against communist attack this is mind boggling i pray that those people who are listening to this or reading it in the congressional record or my colleagues will please pay attention we are talking about training communist chinese military people in ways that will result in the death of thousands if not tens of thousands of american military personnel it is outrageous it is incredible what can you say what can we do to draw attention to this absolute outrage the chinese communist peoples liberation air force and government air traffic control delegation visited the united states between may 9 and may 20 of this year air traffic control certainly sounds harmless the pentagon documents used to brief these chinese visitors show that they observed or participated in advanced combat air force exercises with the unitedstates 389th fighter squadron at luke air force base in arizona they also observed fighter bomber operations at edwards air force base test center in california at these exercises they experienced the real or simulated flights of bombing runs and strafing runs by our most sophisticated military aircraft especially useful for the communist chinese in their potential attack by the communist chinese on taiwan was the briefing they got and these dod documents verify this that they were shown how the military can use civilian airfields to conduct military operations what we see by these dod documents is that our government our defense department showed the communist chinese how we would use our radar systems for air traffic control of fighter bombers at remote airfields we showed the communists how to use awacs in coordinating bombing campaigns we showed the communists how we coordinate our awacs with inflight refueling for longrange missions earlier in this session when i discovered this military exchange program and made it public the congress appealed to the defense department and passed legislation to end military exchanges that would benefit the warfighting skills of the chinese military these dod documents prove that the pentagon has ignored the will of congress instead they have not only jeopardized the 24 million people who live on democratic taiwan but this administration is in effect teaching the communist chinese how to improve their ability to kill americas defenders again this is bizarre it is almost surrealistic i beg my colleagues to pay attention to this i beg the administration to come to their senses quit trying to treat the worlds worst human rights abuser a regime that constantly reminds us that they do not

problems face this country and certainly face our administration one of those problems is keeping social security solvent this affects everybody not only existing retirees but the young middle age and future generations what is going to be their future in terms of working and paying taxes and maybe or maybe not getting social security benefits when they retire social security probably is one of this countrys most successful programs in terms of helping people retire with some security when we started social security in 1935 when franklin roosevelt decided we should have a program to force savings and pay for some disability insurance while you are working rather than risk the poor house at that time there were something like 52 workers for each social security retiree remember it is a payasyougo program existing current workers pay in their social security tax and that tax immediately goes out to pay benefits for existing retirees by the time we got to 1940 there were 38 people working paying in their taxes for every one retiree this year we have three people working three people working paying in their taxes to cover each retirees benefits a couple of things have happened politicians in this chamber the senate and the presidents decided to increase benefits over the yearsbecause it was popular when there was not enough money they increased taxes and borrowing by 2025 over on the far righthand side of this chart you see there are only going to be two workers paying in their taxes for each retiree we started out back in 1940 having a 3 percent tax on the first 1 500 of wages today we have increased that to 12 4 percent on the first almost 76 000 of wages so i hope we all agree one of our challenges is not to increase taxes yet again demographics of longer life span and lower birth rates have also greatly affected solvency the diminishing return on our social security investment should concern us all the real return of social security is less than 2 percent for the average worker in the united states again not counting the amount of the social security tax that pays for the disability insurance portion workers get a real return of less than 2 percent on the taxes paid in for some there is zero return on their social security they are never going to live long enough to get back what they and their employer put into it but still 1 9 percent is the average minorities do not get back what they pay in a young black male for example is going live on the average 62 years that means they pay in all of their life but do not get benefits but the average real return for the market is over 7 percent part of the solution for social security has got to be a better return on the investment this chart shows the number of years you are going to have to live after retirement to get back the money that you and your employer paid in just to break even if you were lucky enough to retire in 1940 it took 2 months if you retired 5 years ago in 1995 you are going to have to live 16 years after retirement to break even on average if you retire in 2005 2015 or 2025 it is unlikely you are going to ever get back what you put into this system even a c d or extra safe investments in the marketplace would give more to retirees governor bush is suggesting limitations on any such investments it can only be used for retirement purposes it has to be limited to safe investments we have companies now that will guarantee a return greater than social security without taking any risks so our challenge is we have to get people this congress the president to develop legislation to save social security it is easy to put off the fixing to the next generation or future congresses vice president gore has suggested adding giant ious that demand increasing taxes later the last president should have dealt with the problem the next president should not put oft solutions that will keep social security solvent for the next 75 years right now there is enough money coming in to pay benefits up until an estimated 2015 we need to take action we cannot keep putting it off"]]}
