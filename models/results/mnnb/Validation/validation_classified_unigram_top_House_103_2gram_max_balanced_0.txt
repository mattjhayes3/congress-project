instruction to the employees and another would prohibit citizenship ceremonies in a language other than english i have introduced and strongly support these bills because i know it is the bond of

difficult transition from their native language into english fluency when they enter american schools bilingual education is based on the idea that the transition can be eased when children can be taughttemporarilyin the language they understand i do share the concerns of mr roth that some bilingual education programs may be losing sight of the original goal of bilingual education the goal of bilingual education was and is to help children become fluent in english as quickly as possible for example while i recognize that there is a transition period whereby children need time to learn english i do not agree with some educators and policymakers about the length of the transition periodwhich some believe should hi711 last as long as 8 years bilingual education was enacted because congresswants limited english proficient students to quickly learn english and move on i think that as with many government programsbilingual education could certainly stand changing and updating however these improvements will not take place if local schools lose federal funds or if all references to bilingual education are eliminated instead we need to work to ensure that local schools have the flexibility to use these funds for programs they believe work best bilingual education programs which use innovative methods to move students along more quickly and thus integrate them with their peers sooner should be encouraged rewarded and highlighted for others to replicate knowledge of english is a key to opportunity in america those who dont speak english have only a limited number of doors available to them in 1990 one in seven children lived in a home where a language other than english was spoken for these children a bilingual education class which quickly and effectively leads

president in his radio message to the country and said that an invasion of haiti could have been one of the most foolish acts of foreign policy of this century fortunately the invasion was made unnecessary by president carter but our troops have instead taken to nationbuilding under the guise of intervention on behalf of an unstable jeanbertrand aristide yes we are in haiti today and our

pull our troops out the very next day after he arrives haiti is not in our national interest and certainly far less so than is cuba let us not endorse this policy let us not debate the unnecessary nuances of what has turned into a major blunder from which we cannot extract ourselves let us put our troops out let us vote no and no and avoid all pretense of support for this failed policy"]]}
