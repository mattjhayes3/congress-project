in support of the various budget proposals some of those speeches very obviously had a definite partisan overtone to them coming from either side of the aisle and others seemed to be very sincere and perhaps nonpartisan in their import but it seems to me that none of us as members of the house can be at all surprised we have heard here today a very fine variety of views on the subject of the budget and how we might best fashion a program of revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year in spite of the great diversity of ideas and opinions that have been reflected here today it seems to me that all of us as members of the house come to agreement on one particular subject and that is the fact that our economy is in trouble today i suppose the real question that we must answer during the coming days of next week is how best to solve the many problems that face our economy we are very concerned about high rates of unemployment we are concerned about lingering high interest rates and we are concerned about low productivity and other aspects of our economic dilemma today it seems to me that most of these proposals argued for or against here this afternoon fall on either one of two sides of a particular divider one of those sides would have us go back to essentially the kind of programs the kind of economic policies that we have had before and the kind of spending and taxing proposals that have ruled here in washington and throughout our country for so many years and on the other side i think the proposals seem to fall on the subject that perhaps we might pursue the course that we set for ourselves last year when we reduced taxes for all americans when we reduced federal spending and when we apparently set up for ourselves a new system of economics in america it seems to me in all fairliess to what we have done in the past to the reputations that each of us have as members of congress and certainly in all fairness to the citizens of this great country that now our course of action would best be to allow the full measure of what we put into effect last year to take its effect to let indeed those tax reductions fall in place as they should and to continue on the course that we set out for ourselves reducing federal expenditures as i see it there can be no doubt as to where most americans are the mail that i receive and the comments that i hear when i go to my district have been conristent throughout the years that i have had the privilege of serving in this house of representatives and that is that americans are asking for restraint i do not hear any comments i do not see any mail from any of my constituents or otherwise asking for increased taxes certainly people want us to reduce the size of the deficit they want us to work toward a balanced budget but they want us to accomplish those efforts through more reductions n federal spending and not adding t their burdens by increasing taxes it seems to me that one of the keys to our recovery in america from the recession we are in and the economic doldrums we are all suffering from is stimulating and staying with programs that will inspire americans to save more of their money in this regard i would simply ask us again to look at the example of japan japan has had high deficits they have had very steep increases in the percent of the gross national product as it is spent by the japanese government but yet they have been able to keep their rates of taxation their rates of interest at acceptable norms simply because they have over the years inspired on the part of their citizens much more savings and a much greater effort toward savings than we here in america do japan has outpassed us by about three times in that particular regard last year in the economic recovery program we set into place some motivations some incentives for americans to save more of their money it seems to me now for us to retreat from that program and revert to the ways of the past would fly directly in the face and be very antithetical to the very kind of recovery that all of us v that savings will contribute toward the kind of capital pool that we need to have for not only the financing of the needs of the government the tremendous deficits that we have in this country but financing the needs of the homebuilding industry those young americans who want to buy their first home and certainly the kind of expansion and increase that we expect to see in american industry and our business base i suggest that this is the essential ingredient that we need to supply to see that america successfully emerges from the recession that has gripped us now for several months i support wholeheartedly the effort which will be made next week to present a budget which will be balanced i think that is what americans want i think we have the responsibility of providing it but if that particular measure falls as it has in previous years i am going to support wholeheartedly the bipartisan approach that has been structured because we do need to have a budget and even though it is not totally the kind of budget that i would like i am willing to forego some of my own preferences and my own desires subordinate my own wishes simply because i think it is going to be better for all of us as americans and certainly as members of congress whether democrat or republican to fashion and structure a budget which the american people are entitled to have i think this subject that we have been debating today is of the most serious importance it is a very grave subject for all of us as members of the house and i would hope we would be able to put aside some of the partisan differences that have prevailed in the past and see our way clear to reflecting the needs of the american people and coming up with a budget which will meet those needs and fulfill our responsibilities as members of the house i appreciate the gentleman yielding this time and yield back the balance of my

authorization for operating expenses for fiscal year 1982 specifically the bill authorizes 1 842 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 2 026 billion in fiscal year 1984 for operating expenses 670 million in fiscal year 1983 and 700 million in fiscal year 1984 for acquisition construction rebuilding and improvements of aids to navigation shore facilities vessels and aircraft 30 million in fiscal year 1983 and 33 million in fiscal year 1984 for research and development and lastly 12 7 million for fiscal year 1983 for the alteration or removal of bridges no funds are authorized for bridge alteration in fiscal year 1984 the bill also establishes an active duty personnel level of 41 500 for both fiscal years 1983 and 1984 while this is a decrease of 724 persons from the fiscal year 1982 authorized level it is approximately 2 000 higher than the actual number of military personnel on duty at the start of the current fiscal year in addition the bill requires the minimum number of civilian employees within the coast guard to be maintained at 5 484 through the end of fiscal year 1984 and authorizes student year levels for military training h r 5617 would also make a number of other changes in existing law to streamline and improve coast guard operations these provisions are listed in the whip advisory before you and are more explicitly described in house report 97563 the coast guard is sometimes referred to as the forgotten service but forgotten by whom surely not by the grateful boater who is floundering and pulled to safety by a coast guard patrol boat nor by the foreign fisherman who is caught in a violation of our fisheries protection laws by a coast guard boarding officer nor by the smuggler of illicit drugs whose boat loaded with marihuana is caught in the spotlight of a coast guard cutter on patrol nor by the community whose shoreline and livelihood are protected by the speedy action of a coast guard oil pollution response team it seems the coast guard is only forgotten by an administration more in terested in saving money than in saving lives in recent years the coast guard has been greatly expanded from its traditonal role of sea rescuer to encompass other equally dangerous yet divergent chores as each mission was added the service sought to carry it out in a highly professional manner the only impediment to this goal has been the lack of proper resources as more and more duties were heaped upon the coast guard less and less money was made available to carry them out at the end of the last fiscal year this meant sea patrols were canceled and aircraft grounded because the funds needed to purchase fuel had already been utilized primarily in the coast guards haitian and cuban interdiction operations not learning from this experience last year the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget proposal for the coast guard was again woefully inadequate it called for a 20percent decrease from the 1982 appropriation and would have resulted in a 30percent reduction from 1980 in coast guard cutter hours for general law enforcement including drug law enforcement a 42percent reduction in cutter hours for fishery law enforcement a 45percent reduction in aircraft flight hours for general law enforcement a 37percent reduction in aircraft flight hours for fishery law enforcement a reduction of 3 000or 9percentin coast guard military personnel the immediate mothballing of 18 newlyproduced medium range surveillance aircraft a 40percent cut over 2 years in the coast guards smallbut highly efficientresearch and development program and a reduction in the coast guards original request for 1983 procurement funds from 670 million to 19 million a cut of more than 97 percent the shortcomings of the administrations proposal were recognized by the members of the merchant marine committee who drawing on knowledge gained though a series of six oversight hearings held by our subcommittee on coast guard and navigation last yearas well as testimony received in hearings on h r 5617 developed the authorization bill before the house today the passage of this legislation will allow the coast guard to carry on with its vital marine safety law enforcement environmental protection and military readiness missions throughout the next 2 fiscal years i might add that the administrations underfunding request received an icy reception from members on both sides of the aisle as well as from our colleagues in the other body who have already passed an authorization bill with substantially higher funding levels than the administrations request h r 5617 also contains a 144 million increase in the authorization for coast guard operating expenses for fiscal year 1982 this increase added to the 48 million authorized last year but not appropriated will when received as supplemental appropriations allow the coast guard to continue operations throughout the remainder of this fiscal year at a level comparable to last year i the house has already heard the rationale for this fundingseveral timesduring the many hours of debate on the various supplemental appropriations bills i will however reiterate that these funds are urgently needed to cover a legally required military pay increase higher fuel costs n increase in the cost of personnel benefits the continued haitian interdiction program and to eliminate the need to close or reduce operations at coast guard facilities across the country july 15 1 982 i my colleagues will recall the public uproar caused by the administrations announcement of these closures reductions and vessel decommissionings in january of this year over 100 members of both parties cosponsored a supplemental appropriations bill introduced by myself and the chairman and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation it is these cutbacks many of which were withdrawn by the department of transportation in anticipation of a supplemental that this increase will prevent in closing i would ask that we remember that the coast guard is not an intangible abstract budget line it is an organization of dedicated men and women who literally risk their lives to provide a host of services which are absolutely essential to the health safety economy and environment of the united states give them the tools to do their job correctly support not only this legislation but when it comes to the floor a supplemental appropriation for the coast guard h r 5617 would also make a number of other changes in existing law to

crime particularly violent crime happily there appears to be a way to do both at once i am speaking of the seven regional multistate criminal intelligencesharing projects which were created under the auspices of the leaa and which proved so successful that they survived the demise of that program as chairman of the government operations subcommittee on government information and individual rights i convened 2 days of hearings on these projects in 1981 on october 20 of last year the committee on government operations issued a report of our findings h rept no 97280 we found that the multistate projects were serving their law enforcement members and the public well and that they were returning to the federal treasury in recoveries far more than they were costing they were scrupulously observing privacy and security guidelines for those members unfamiliar with the projects they operate on a regional basis to provide a mechanism through which member local law enforcement agencies can coordinate significant criminal investigations share intelligence pool resources and communicate with each other they operate under strict guidelines promulgath1774 17 ed by the department of justice and receive funding through grants channeled through a duly constituted governmental entity such as a state attorney generals office or other units of state or local government the concept for the projects was formally advanced in the 1976 national advisory committee on criminal justice standards and goals report on organized crime which noted that some prototype networks were even then showing degrees of success in march 1980 my predecessor as chairman of the government information and individual rights subcommittee richardson preyer requested gao to review the projects their report the multistate regional intelligence projectswho will oversee these federally funded networks ggd8136 spoke of the problems and potential of the projects to enhance the effectiveness of our state and local law enforcement agencies in their battle against mobile sophisticated criminals at the hearings in may 1981 witnesses from the department of justice while admitting that the projects were effective in providing coordinating services to member agencies nevertheless called for a cessation of federal funding for them according to the witnesses the department of justice could no longer afford the 5 to 7 million annual price tag for the projects they told us that since the inception of the projects the department of justice had spent a total of just over 16 million and received in return from one project alone over 50 million in referrals to the irs on tax fraud cases i am pleased to note that this figure today exceeds 100 million the other six projects report over 750 million in recovered narcotics stolen property and currency the departments position was simply that it was a matter of priority for funding they wished to have put those funds in other programs i for one am glad they did not i am joined in this feeling by a least 54 members of this house who cosponsored house resolution 166 expressing our support and encouraging the department of justice to continue funding the projects in the senate 27 members includ ing the entire republican leadership recently signed a letter to the attorney general to urge his support for the projects the response of the department to that letter painted a rather gray picture of the projects suggesting that they were not as valuable as we were being led to believe i am pleased therefore to be able today to share with my colleagues the findings of the institute for intergovernmental research iir a private research firm of impeccable reputation with whom the department of justices office of justice assistance research and statistics ojars had contracted for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the multistate projects their final report issued earlier this summer is a ringing endorsement of the performance of these innovative projects iir found that the most troublesome problem of the project managers has been to deal with the department of justice not with the criminals whom they were organized to fight it finds that the projects in their individual operations reflect the priorities of their respective regions ranging from narcotics to organized crime to coal industry fraud iir agreed with the findings of our committee that the projects are cognizant of the doj leaa criminal intelligence systems operating policies and that each had implemented formal policies restricting criminal information dissemination only to member agencies importantly iir states while all the projects exchange information with one auother on an asneeded basis there is no evidence or indication that the projects are developing or intend to develop a coordinated nationwide intelligence system in commenting on the continuing disagreement between the congress and the department of justice over the value of the projects irr found the regional information sharing systems riss projects as a group and the department of justice have divergent views concerning the merits of congressional appropriations to the department of justice to financially support the ris projects these divergent views have resulted in numerous difficulties in the routine administration of project funds and have served to detract from the effectiveness of ojars management of the program however the intent of the congress that the department provide funding in support of the multistate projects has in fact been fulfilled the first of many recommendations made by iir is one which i endorse and commend to the attention of members of this house it is that federal funding be continued because of the importance of the contributions of the projects to state and local law enforcement the seven multistate regional intelligence projects with member states and host agencies are"], [0.3976171612739563,

has been stimulating for 2 hours they have raised many questions about the continuing budget that we have before us here in congress and this budget certainly is the most important issue facing our entire country today as i listened to them many thoughts came to my mind and i kept writing down this note and i wrote down that note the first thing that is very strong in my mind is the fact that for 27 years this congress has been controlled and been dominated both the house and the senate by one political party the democrats they have controlled congress for 27 years in fact up until this year when we got a little relief the democrates controlled the house by 90 votes with a 90vote margin you can pass all of the bills you want to and they did and they have also controlled the senate they controlled the senate over there by 59 to 41 until this year now they are talking here tonight about what have the republicans in the senate brought out to us what have they brought before us in the way of suggestions on reducing the budget i listened to the gentlemen over here and they talked about what government could do and government could do this and government could do that i could not help but think about the only time that i had experience with what the government could do for me i enjoyed the government for 31a years and i wanted it that was when i served in the army and i wanted the opportunity to serve but when i went in the army paid me 21 a month if you talk to people on welfare today about 21 a month they will feel insulted but they gave me a uniform and the army gave me 21 a month but once i was in that army they expected me to take care of myself i had been married for 4 months and my wife and i made out as they were talking here i remembered one time when we were up against it and had it pretty tough we were down at tullahoma tenn most people have not heard of tullahoma tenn but i remember because that is where we staged and prepared the 1197th engineers while we were getting ready to go and join pattons 3d army in europe and i wanted dee to be with me but that was a little town and we had thousands and thousands of troops and the government did not do anything for you so i went down to the baptist church and i talked to the chairman of the board the head deacon and i told him i said i am just a texas boy and i do not know where to turn and he found us a room some lady let us have a small room in her house and when our outfit shipped out for europe dee went back and lived with her folks in new jersey you know basically when you get back down to the real tough situations in this world you do not get the answer out of the government you get it out of your friends you get it out of your neighbors you get it out of your kinfolk you get it out of good people in every community it is not the government that solves very much i heard an interesting remark this morning my colleague the gentleman from california mr jerry lzwis said jim i want to show you something that i just sent out to everybody back in my district i said what is it and he showed it to me and it was about a black woman who had absolutely nothing except pride and selfrespect she raised three boys who are all outstanding doctors in chicago today they have a big clinic they have 62 people working in their clinic she has two grandsons who are now finishing medical school he said just look what they have done well i will tell you that woman is 95 years old so obviously hard work did not affect her health but the thing that really impressed me about it is that this woman did it and she did it by herself and the reason i thought so much about that story i had a group of people call on me yesterday they were a real fine group of five women who came up from texas to tell me how we needed government programs to take care of children and we needed this program and we hi 8753 needed that program to take care of children and i told them about a survey that i saw recently and i thought abouit it when he told me about this interesting lady up in chicago they said for the needs to take care of children we ought to have this government group do that and that a few years ago they made a survey up in harvard they were trying to prove as i understand it that forced school busing would work but they came up with another interesting conclusion because busing will not work but what they did find was this they found that the greatest way to motivate children what builds for childrens success what really builds for childrens success it is parents love and interest parents motivation that is not something that government gives you that is something you get from your parents in love and inspiration i was thinking as they were talking about how could people make out in fact they were talking about college i went to smu it is a school down in texas and when i was down there one of the finest fellowshe is my very close friend today one of the closest friends i ever had old johnhis dad said son i cannot give you much but i am going to give you a name so he named him john d after john d rockefeller well he was as poor as jobes turkey he grew up over there in a little town named mineola he lived on a little old farm out from there but he was a pretty good football player and he came to smu on a scholarship well in those days if you did not make the team they dropped you and he did not make the freshmen team so they dropped him but that did not end it for john john went down and got him a job down there at ford and hie started working and he also got a job in the dormitory working by helping the athletes who were not too smart on their grades between helping with tutoring and helping out there he made it and then after he had been at ford a while he got him a better job with a company called core laboratory it was a little company analyzing oil wells he went to work for them well it is interesting about john he worked his way completely through college his daddy was dead when he was there when he was trying to go through college and he helped his mother out he paid all of his expenses through college he paid everything there was for an education but working through college turned out to be a blessing because after he got through doing 4 years in the submarines of the unitedstates navy he came back and went to work for that same company and today john is president of the core laboratories which is the biggest oil research company in the world they know more about geology and they do more petroleum geology work than any oil company in the world john wisenbaker is president of the company and nobody gave john any advantage he just made it he made it through hard work in fact when we were in college back in smuwe talk about all of these things we are going to do for kids today in college the best thing we could do would be to give them an opportunity to work their way through college when i was in college half lof my classmates there were making their way through college and they were being paid 50 cents an hour if they were lucky there is nothing wrong with work the government cannot do much for you it cannot do everything there is not as much that the government can do that the private citizen cannot do better i was interested in one other thing it is about sewers i thought about all the time i was in the army if you were ever in the service you know that you did not have much inside plumbing i remember that the healthiest i ever was in my life was the time i served under the 3d army general patton i slept outdoors i slept in the rain i slept in the mnud the snow the ice and i never had any of thismodern sewer system which they keep worrying about but what i thought about as they talked about it was a fellow named tiger teague and the gentleman from wisconsin sitting over there would remember tiger teague because there never was a finer man that ever served in congress he served on your side of the aisle over here he got the name tiger becaused he was such a tiger when he was with tibat infantry outfit in europe and you remember he used to limp around here with all of that shrapnel that he still oarried in his leg but one thing that tiger told me that i remember so well one day when were talking about sewers he said jim i never knew we had inside plumbing until i went to texas a m and he said i did not feel deprived in any way he said i could hold myhead as high as any man who was a freshman down there because what my family gave me they did not give me inside plumbing but they gave me pride and selfrespect i thought about that as we today talk about everything the govenment can give people everything we can do for everybody in this congressional spending when we go home to our districts when we finish this continuing resolution i hope we talk to the folks back home and talk to them about government spending because 9 out of 10 of them will tell youthey will tell you that we have just got to cut back on all of this government spending the other day someone summed it up pretty well the question was asked he said how can big government solve the problem"],

colleagues have taken the time to read some of the documentation first this is a test program that the president requests that we continue for an additional year second it is already available in all of our nondefense spending we already have this amendment in public law and are using it not in a test program but in the nondefense civilian procurement third it will strengthen our national defense because the nation cannot quickly tool up for wartime production when thousands of factories are idle and millions of workers are left jobless use of the dla test program to target contracts to high unemployment areas is a significant tool to combat the effects of the recession on distressed urban areas without fueling inflation because the program focuses spending on areas that have a surplus of labor it avoids the effect of heating up the labor market in areas that have high levels of employment or even shortages of skilled workers dr david rasmussen of florida state university explained this noninflationary effect to the house small business subcommittee on capital investment and business opportunities i would like to quote from his testimony the labor surplus policy is one way to raise the employment effects of a given rate of growth it is an attempt to selectively raise employment in those areas which economic growth is last to reach such a policy lowers the amount of growth required to achieve any target rate of unemployment and therefore works to reduce inflationary pressures in the economy some may view the labor surplus policy as a zero sum game that jobs created in areas of persistent unemployment will be lost in other areas this is a misperception in fact the view presented above suggests that the entire nation receives some benefits from efforts to increase the number of jobs in highunemplyment areas if we take our commitment to full employment seriously this policy will help produce conditions under which we can realize full employment in most labor markets with less inflation rather than having less than full employment in areas ineligible for the labor surplus policy they may suffer less inflation when they do have full employment monetary and fiscal policy can stimulate growth to generate full employment in most labor markets these areas will not lose jobs because of the labor surplus policy in fact these regions benefit because the nation can reach full employment with less inflation with a commitment to our stated goal of full employment the labor surplus program does not rob peter to pay paul there is no evidence to indicate the dla test program has reduced competition or increased the cost of goods to the military first competition is restricted only on those contracts set aside for labor surplus areas and this occurs only when the defense department determines that enough firms will bid on the contracts to insure adequate competition therefore the pentagon is not required to target purchases to lsas if the secretary of defense determines that an unreasonable price will result or it is not in the best interests of the nation in fact the program most likely increases competition by bringing more firms into the bidding process and this additional competition serves to keep prices down second the defense logistics agency has paid a small price differential under this program on only a relatively few contracts preliminary results from a study of the first 11 months of the program indicate that dla paid a price differential on fewer than 15 percent of the contracts it awarded to firms in lsas and the average differential on these contracts came to just 1 9 percent the language of the stratton amendment would lower the allowable differential from 5 to 3 percent further preventing the payment of unreasonable prices the early performance of the program means that if the dla pays a low price differential on 1 billion worth of contracts the added cost to the government would be less than 20 millionan investment by the federal government that would generate 3 to 4 billion in privatesector activity in distressed areas when the resulting reductions income maintenance payments unemployment insurance food stamps housing subsidies and the like are considered the actual cost of this program is greatly reduced or even eliminated modification of the maybank amendment and establishment of the defense logistics agency test program have neither jeopardized awards to the best qualified and most efficient producers nor resulted in decreased quality or delays in defense production if anything the result is just the opposite by increasing the competition for contract awards and the incentive for companies to perform well the program more likely increases the quality of goods available to the military and the likelihood of ontime delivery many of the nations best qualified and most efficient producers are located in labor surplus areas in fact nearly onefourth of the nations cities counties and other elibible jurisdictions have been designated as labor surplus areastestimohiy to the widespread nature of our economic difficulties and the need for a program like this one the many manufacturing centers among these lsas probably have more qualified firms than other parts of the country states that historically have contributed heavily to the nations defense effortsnew york california new jersey georgia connecticut florida and pennsylvania for exampleall have a significant number of lsas with many firms that must be counted among the nations most qualified and efficient these firms are proud of the quality of their products and their ability to meet contract deadlines it also should be noted that the portion of the pentagon budget affected by modification of the maybank amendment and establishment of the test program involves purchases made by the defense logistics agency the branch of the defense department responsible for procuring nonstrategic goods and services widely used by all sections of the military this combined budget represents roughly 15 to 20 billion for the purchase of such common items as food clothing medical supplies hardware hand tools insignia books boxes and so forth targeting such purchases to companies in highunemployment areas broadens the base of available suppliers and because many of these companies are small businesses eager for government contracts the program is likely to result in better quality and performance as well as reasonable competitive prices modification of the maybank amendment and establishment of the dla test program have not adversely affected the nations ability to mobilize for an emergency by denying some firms the opportunity to compete for contracts in fact the original purpose of defense manpower policy no 4 dmp4 was to minimize idle labor and machinery in connection with the nations efforts in korea by directing federal purchases to firms located in areas of high unemployment the policy helps insure that the nation has a broad and diverse manfuacturing base capable of meeting defense needs passage of the stratton amendment would continue a program that helps prevent procurement delays caused by a lack of trained workers at qualified manufacturing facilities thus in case of war or other national emergency a greater number of firms would be prepared to tool

permit the deduction of expenses for conventions held on unitedstatesflag passenger ships when all ports of call are within the north american area the 96th congress recognized the important economic benefit of a unitedstatesflag passenger fleet when it approved legislation enabling certain passenger vessels to engage in this nations domestic commerce as a result the ss oceanic independence began offering passenger service in the hawaiian islands during 1980 the 97th congress enacted legislation permitting the sister ship of the ss oceanic independence the ss constitution to enter the domestic service in the hawaiian islands this measure was signed into law march 2 1982 and enabled the ss constitution to begin operation in june of this year i am pleased to report that the independence has recently called on the port of los angeles modern passenger terminal facilities the vessels successful passage from los angeles to the hawaiian islands can be viewed as a trial run for potential future west coast to hawaii passenger vessel service but i believe that the future success and expansion of the unitedstates passenger ship industry rests in part on the ability to host conventions our existing passenger vessels are operating on margin for example the ss constitution is now in danger of being laid up due to declining passengers but these vessels and several others operating in the shallow draft and deepsea trades are fully capable of providing suitable meeting facilities and the technical equipment necessary to conduct productive business conferences h r 3191 is critical to the unitedstates passenger ship industry because of the following reasons an allowable tax deduction for convention expenses on unitedstates flag passenger vessels will provide professional and industry organizations the incentive to make greater use of these convention facilities the ability to host business confer ences will attract additional investments by domestic passenger ship operators to expand their operations and provide new employment opportunities for example the two new ships in the hawaiian island trades alone created jobs for nearly 900 seagoing workers rotating between the two ships over the course of the year there would be in addition 100 direct shoreside jobs and many more indirect shoreside jobs created as a consequence of passenger service from the port of los angeles to hawaii furthermore i understand that the department of the navy enthusiastically supports enactment of h r 3191 because the unitedstates flag deepsea vessels suitable for hosting shipboard conventions can also be used in times of national emergency as troop transports and hospital ships in conclusion i believe that it is simply inequitable to permit a tax deduction for convention expenses at landbased hotels while not permitting the same deduction for a business convention held on a unitedstates passenger ship under current law convention expenses are deductible even when the convention is held in canada or mexico i am told that this bill has a negligible affect on budget receipts but it may be the last hope to continue the work of the 96th congress in

in the last 4 years the first secret briefing was on the panama canal treaty when our distinguished majority leader delivered one of his more eloquent speeches unfortunately the general public was not aware of it because of course the cameras were not turned on the second classified briefing was to discuss nicaragua and its export of terrorism that fascinating briefing did not have much effect upon the membership but when the general public was allowed to view some of that classified briefing on the sovietdesigned cubanbuilt terrorist training camps in nicaragua the results were swift and supportive of unitedstates policy when john t hughes of the defense intelligence agency went before the cameras and press of the free world and ended up op the front page of every newspaper in this country pointing to the strategic reconnaissance photography of nicaraguan guerrilla training camps it had a telling effect those of you who are historians on the cuban missile crisis may recall that

afternoon i think it is very very interesting the swings that we have seen on public opinion on this issue it is quite remarkable when you stop to think of it that we started out last year with a salt agreement we had worked out in 1979 a very very complicated and perhaps too complicated but a very complicated salt agreement that agreement was very carefully looked at by all of the experts it was looked at by generals examined by experts in the academic world looked at by public officials examined from all angles and when it was presented to the public the publics reaction was generally very blah now here we are a couple of years later and scribbled on the back of an envelope is the idea to freeze everything where it is now and like one the american public is rising up and saying lets charge d 1710 it is an interesting comment and i think it is an interesting comment on arms control and an interesting comment on the state of public opinion about the question i think that what we have seen here is that the american public has suddenly become very concerned about nuclear weapons and the reaction of not being involved with nuclear weapons to being hyperly involved with nuclear weapons is not such a complete break as you might think basically speaking i think that most peoples reaction to nuclear weapons is that nuclear weapons are so horrible and nuclear war so difficult to comprehend that the first reaction of people is to block it out entirely to not want to think about it at all and to ignore it and to hope that somehow it is all going to go away if something breaks through that shell and forces people to confront the issue of nuclear weapons and the horror of nuclear weapons the reaction is likely to be a jump over completely to very much active involvement in the issue meaning getting involved in petition drives in meetings and protests organizations teachins and other things people can jump from one state to the other with hardly a pause in between i think that is what has happened and i think what has happened is that that protective shell under which a lot of people were able to ignore nuclear weapons for so long has been broken through and i think that the current administration deserves a great deal of the credit or blame for having done that with casual discussion about nuclear weapons visibility of nuclear weapons civil defense as a result people have been forced to confront it and when they confront the issue they are very much involved with it and want to do something about it the result is the freeze i think that the freeze has a lot of good political value for trying to get a constituency going in favor of arms control and i think from that standpoint it is very very good personally i would have a different approach than a freeze as an opening negotiating position with the soviet union i think as a negotiating position it has some problems but as a political movement i think it has a great deal of merit let me just state some of the problems that i see with it in terms as a negotiating position not to say that i do not think that the freeze movement is a good idea but the question about whether in fact we would want to start from a freeze first i think that you start with a very very difficult position if you want to change our negotiating position in regards to the soviets under president ford we had negotiated something called the vladivostok accords everybody will remember signing the vladivostok accords they were all set they were worked out with president ford and secretary kissinger worked it all out and came a change the election changed the administration and the carter administration came into office in retrospect the carter administration should have signed the vladivostok accords and proceeded to negotiate salt ii from that position but they did not they said the vladivostok accords set the limits too high and that what we want is something brand new so they came in with what has become known as the march 1977 pro posals and dramatically cutdramatic arms proposals rejected by the soviet union it was enormously complicated years later took a long time to negotiate finally at the end of the carter term in office salt ii was negotiated signed by the administration negotiated by the secretary of state and again we have a change in administrations now what the freeze seems to be saying is that we want to ignore salt and go to something new again that what we want to do is set what we have negotiated in salt aside and come up with something simpler and more dramatic which is the freeze i thin we are rewritink the record we made at vladivostok we should have signed vladivostok and proceeded to negotiate from there what we should do now is to sign salt ii and proceed to negotiate from there rather than coming in with something brand new and in the way of a freeze the second problem i see with a freeze is that you really do need in negotiations to be able to have something that the other side wants to have taken away in order to negotiate you have to have something that the other side would like to accomplish in a negotiation something that you are doing that they want to stop something that you might do that they want to stop ultimately the freeze wants to move to reductions the difficulty is that the freeze by itself would accomplish most of the objectives that the soviet union would have in a negotiation and they would be under very little pressure to negotiate the further step which is the reduction what we have or what we are going to have in our arsenal that the soviets are fearful of as best we can tell is a new trident missile which makes the landbased missiles vulnerable the dwe have a landbased missile the mx which also makes their landbased missile vulnerable a third thing is the sealaunched cruise missiles those are the three things that the soviets are now concerned about in terms of what we have and if we are going to get reduction on the soviet side clearly the soviets would want us first to have to reduce something in those areas but the freeze would stop all of those the freeze would stop each of those systems and would not allow us to proceed on the other hand the thing that we are most concerned about on the soviet side and the thing we would like to get out of a negotiation is a reduction in the vulnerability of minuteman missiles which is a reduction either on the mirv warheads or in the number of very large missiles that they have on their side that can threaten our land based icbms a freeze would leave them with their large missiles and their warheads on those large missiles so i see a littlebit of inequity in the next step i am not saying the people who are for the freeze are not right i mean when you have so many missiles on both sides what difference does it make that is a valid point the gentleman from iowa said it there is something to be said for that but if you are going to the next step the reduction the question is whet do you have that the other side wants and what does the other side have that you want what i am worried about is that the freeze would by itself stop what they want to stop and there would be very little incentive for the soviets to go the next step which is the reduction the final point which i think is important as a negotiating position is that i think it is very very difficult once a freeze is in effect for a democracy ever to say that the thing is not working and we are going to have to go back it is like the bombing pause in vietnam it is like other kinds of halts in activity in a democracy i think it is very hard if you decide that the freeze is not working and is not going to lead to the next step to actually turn it around and say we tried it and we are going to go ahead so for those three reasons i really have had some question about whether a freeze is the best negotiating position that we can lead with as i say i am so happy to see some political interest in the arms control area and some political interest in reducing nuclear weapons that i think that there is a lot of good to be said for the freeze and the people who are interested in the freeze it is just as a negotiating position i would prefer to see us go with salt ii here we are with salt ii what in the name of god is wrong with salt ii it is looking better and better everyday at the time salt ii was rejected it was rejected because something better was held out as being possible the people that did not like h 1210 co salt ii said it allowed the soviets to have 308 large icbms and we should have the same or they should not have them at all the people who objected to the provision on the backfire bomber said that there was not enough of a provision on the backfire bomber we did not have enough assurances that the backfire could not be used for intercontinental weaponry they objected to the provision on the telemetry they objected to lots of things and the problem was that we were looking at salt ii versus some idealized treaty that was held up as being possible and under those circumstances salt ii did not look so good but now the question is salt ii versus nothing because we have voted down or have not ratified salt ii we have not voted it up and we have not voted it down it was not voted on at all so we have not ratified salt ii salt ii is sitting out there as an alternative but the alternative to salt ii is now nothing and salt ii looks pretty good the interesting thing about salt ii is that we have been following everything in salt ii if we look at the reagan defense budget big as it is if we look at the reagan budget in 1981 or the reagan budget in 1982 big as it is there is no one single weapon that we are proposing or have started or anything that is inconsistent with salt ii everything that ronald reagan wants to do and the pentagon wants to do we could have done under salt ii we are following salt ii we are following it precisely so why not ratify it the only difficulty with the situation is that the only thing that we are not getting out of salt ii is that if we did ratify salt ii the soviets would have to follow salt ii and under salt ii they would have to dismantle 10 percent of their missiles so we are following it but instead of following it and getting them to reduce by 10 percent which we could have done if we had ratified salt ii they are following it but now they do not have to reduce by 10 percent so it makes no sense the soviets are following salt ii except for defense production every time they get a new submarine salt ii said they have to dismantle an old submarine they are doing it every time we get a new submarine we have to dismantle an old one we are doing it we are all following it the only thing is that we are not getting the 10percent reduction why not ratify it and make the soviets reduce by 10 percent because there is nothing that we are doing or that the reagan administration is planning to do or that they have in the back of their beady little minds any gleam in their eyes or anything they want to do which is inconsistent"], [0.585936963558197,

syria iraq iran and the soviet union therefore obviously remains a key country in the region indeed the importance of turkey to the middle east has already been amply demonstrated during the october 1973 war when military installations in turkey detected the passage of soviet nuclear warheads through the dardanelles en route to syria or egypt and the mobilization of paratroopers at soviet bases this early detection permitted a timely unitedstates response that averted a deeper soviet involvement in the conflict with all its consequences the soviets knowing their supply lines over and around turkey could be cut abandoned their plans in addition to recognizing the strategic importance of turkey however it is important to note today that the current military government in turkey is taking steps to restore that country to democracy general evren has announced a timetable for a return to full democracy a consultative assembly was convened last october to draft a new constitution this constitution is to be completed by the end of the summer a referendum on the constitution will be held in november 1982 and general elections will occur in the fall of 1983 we all look forward to the

everybody but now we come with a bummer of a bill for the farmers the last thing on the agenda the farm economy in this country is in really bad shape there is not any question about it tractor companies are going broke international harvester has to reorganize within a week and find 41 2 billion to do it with and other machinery companies and suppliers have had big layoffs four percent of the people in this country that farm use 15 percent of the manufactured goods to produce more than twothirds of all the new wealth when those 4 percent are affected the way they are right now we cannot help but have reduced employment more layoffs and affect their whole economy so this is no time to reduce protection now some are going to say well then why do so many support the bill the chairman of the house committee put out a list of supporters i want my colleagues to take a look at the list the first two pages are people who own sugar the other page lists such farmers as the california state florists the california chrysanthemum growers colorado greenhouse growers florida ornamental growers hawaii bankers association where are the real farmers now it seems to me rather strange that in this bill they have treated the commodities in reverse order to their importance i say that for this reason the sugar people seem to be about the only people who are satisfied do my colleagues know how many there are in the whole united states who make 2 500 or more growing beets or cane there are 4 200 in the whole united states there are more candy manufacturers in the united states than there are sugar producers there are 307 000 feed grain growers 195 000 soybean growers 76 000 wheat growers one hundred and fortythree thousand raise tobacco or make most of their money out of raising tobacco but only 4 200 are in the sugar business so that is who we treated well in this and as far as measuring importance of the crop by their value of their product it is ever a worse comparison the value of feed grains is 23 billion of soybeans 14 billion of wheat 8 2 billion peanuts only 800 million and sugar less than 1 billion the benefited commodities are relatively a sliver group there are 71 times as many feed grain growers as there are sugar growers and the value of their product is 23 times as great as a matter of fact i represent more farmers in the district i represent than there are sugar growers in the whole united states well now the administration tactic as stockman sid in the atlantic article was divide and conquer and that is what they have done they are dividing us up here and the splinter farm commodity group is satisfied and helping stick a knife in the back of principal commodities now somebody is going to go up here and say well we have a clause in here that helps take care of embargoes and eveybody is worried about embargoes right now let me tell this the embargo clause is a complete farce if they embargo lead pencils at the same time or do not have a general embargo at the same time as farm commodities are embargoed it does not apply there is certainly going to be some kind of strategic material embargoed in the same embargo it does not mean a thing the embargo clause does not as far as embargo is concerned just talking about it ought to encourage the soviets it will help them because whenever the grains are embargoed gold prices go up and the grain price goes down and that means then they can go on a world market and buy more than ever with the same amount of gold like they did corn during the last embargo four times as much for their gold as they did before embargoes help russia food stamps have been mentioned here let me clear that up in the conference report on appropriations food stamps were both authorized and appropriated for 1982 this bill is not needed however it drops the authorization after 1 year and the authority will expire when the commodities do not expire that makes food stamps vulnerable by themselves t have a number of subjects i would like to cover but food stamps are covered completely in the conference report this is not going to do a solitary thing for food stamps this is the first time since 1962 that i have voted against a farm bill i do it hesitatingly and only after great deliberation i voted against the mandatory allotment for corn and helped defeat that bill and i am glad i did but this is a bad bill this is a bummer of a bill we are worse off than with no bill we have a 2 73 loan rate for example on corn if we do not have a bill and under this bill 2 55 we need just a loan and reserve programs will help them to facilitate their marketing that is what we need instead of target prices and deficiency payments but this bill permits the adminstration to eliminate those

measure after careful consideration of the provisions of the conference report on the tax bill and after consultation with the people in my district in new york i have decided to vote against this tax bill i previously voted against sending the bill directly to conference because at that time i had serious reservations with certain provisions and hoped that the house as the revenueinitiating body might have an opportunity to hear debate on the issues involved and the effects of this bill on all segments of america this has not been an easy decision for any of us to make and i congratulate the conferees who have worked long exhausting hours and put a great deal of tremendous thought into producing an equitable bill there are provisions in this legislation with which i agree wholeheartedly and i want to do what is best for this country in reducing record high deficits to get interest rates down and hopefully stimulate the economy overall however i feel that the shortterm benefit of the revenue increase is not worth the longterm loss to american taxpayers of particular concern is the effect of some of these provisions on the average taxpayer with a minimum amount of money to save and who barely makes ends meet once expenses are accounted for at the end of the year the medical expense deducation limits will hit millions of americans very hard and may go directly to affect not only their expenses but their health the conferees eliminated the original proposal to halve the three martini lunch provision yet maintained the tip income reporting requirement again the hardworking american is tackled here rather than those more capable of affording stiffer tax requirements it gives the impression of unfairness as does another compliance provisionthe withholding tax of 10 percent on most interest and dividends at a time when we are working to stimulate savings and investment to restore growth and productivity to our ailing economy we turn around and by this provision reduce the incentive to say by implying that these small savers have not been complying with the law and therefore will be deprived of interest earned on those savings up until the time of reporting though i applaud that portion of the withholding provisions exempting senior citizens and others below a certain income level i believe the reporting provisions required by this and the general withholding provisions would be a devastating blow to our nations banks and savings and loans many of which are struggling as it is the cost and complication of the withholding provisions to our financial institutions and the impact it will have on individual savings has been a major factor in my early determination that this aspect of the bill should be considered separately from the rest of the tax bill the fact that we are not able to consider individual provisions of the bill which do have such an impact on the workers in america is especially important because this bill involves so

the provision bringing them into the medicare system by requiring that they contribute 1 3 percent of their salary to it every year finally although it is true that we should be doing more to reduce the deficit this tax bill attempts to accomplish this laudable goal in the wrong way it does so by raising taxes taking money out of the private sector while we are in a crucial phase of a recovery we

requiring the 10 percent withholding on interest and dividend earnings despite many of the much needed reforms in h r 4961 there are many other very bad provisions the 10 percent withholding provisions on interest and dividends remain particularly troublesome and will only result in unnecessary cost and paperwork burdens on financial institutions and corporations as many members have expressed their deepest concern with regard to these provisions i believe that failure to provide for a separate vote on the withholding provisions could prove fatal to final passage of this bill as our colleague from new hampshire hon nonman damouns has so aptly stated withholding is overkill it is not withholding that is needed to insure taxpayer compliance but rather better use of information on interest and dividends much of which is already provided on 1099 forms taxpayer compliance with regard to dividend and interest reporting is already remarkably high at a 96 7 percent compliance rate the provisions outlined in h r 4961 will only result in a nominal increase in compliance but at the same time will require millions of new forms to be processed while creating clearly unreasonable paperwork i regret that the real impact of the 10 percent withholding provisions will not come from better compliance but rather from speeding up collections by the irs many taxpayers however already have more than their fair share of taxes withheld from income during the tax year requiring withholding on dividend and interest will only complicate this matter further resulting in the federal government holding more than its share from taxpayers and requiring larger refunds to individuals at the end of the year clearly the projected revenue gain resulting from instituting these provisions is overstated and illusory in conclusion the interest and dividend withholding provisions are an extremely costly way to improve compliance from a very small group of individuals there are
