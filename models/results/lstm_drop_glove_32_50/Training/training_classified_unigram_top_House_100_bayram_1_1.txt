homelessness in our society is a national shame that has to be addressed on a bipartisan basis and quickly for those that think that somehow this is anecdotal information about the homeless i would recommend that they visit the nearest shelter and see what that is like and then decide whether they need to support this kind of emergency aid it is a nationai shame when one block from the white house and one block from the capitol there are people sleeping on grates that needs to be addressed and that is what we try to do with this legislation in addition to that i have particular concerns about the temporary emergency feeding program the administration has recommended a deferral of funds needed now for emergency food that needs to be addressed as well unfortunately we have not received the message yet and so we cannot attack the deferral but i hopethat the committee will also respond to do away with that deferral so that we can provide that food as well as this funding to try to deal with this shame in our society it is in the nature of an emergency it is in the nature of urgent relief that is needed and let us act at this time in that manner i rise in strong support of this supplemental one of the most urgent priorities we face is to provide for the homeless in our society particularly with the severe winter conditions here in the east we must move rapidly to prevent death from the elements the word urgent in the title of this resolution is therefore most appropriate another urgent issue is addressed by the committee on appropriations in its report on this supplemental this issue is the proposed deferral by the reagan administration of more than half of the funds which the congress appropriated for the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap is the way by which surplus agriculture commodities are distributed to the poor and the homeless tefap has a demonstrated track record of being the fastest way to get food to the homeless in fact a deferral message has yet to be transmitted as required by law even though the officials of the department of agricultures food and nutrition service are already notiflying the states that substantial amounts of their allotment for the current quarter will be withheld the announcement that funds will be deferred has created understandable consternation among program administrators at the state and local levels what is particularly outrageous about the reagan administrations proposal is that this deferral would effectively close down the program for the second half of fiscal year 1987 it also cuts state administrative funding in the current quarter with no forewarning few states would have the flexibility to pick up the slack with so little notice furthermore the presidents budget indicates that authority will be requested from the congress to use these deferred funds to finance the pay raise and retirement benefits of federal workers in the department of agriculture given the increasing problem of homelessness in the united states which was very well documented in a report by the conference of mayors released last month i frankly find it obscene that tefap would be effectively terminated to finance pay raises and retirement benefits for federal workers in addition this proposed deferral is a backdoor way to close down the tefap program the presidents budget for fiscal year 1988 again proposes no funds for the administrative costs associated with the distribution of surplus tefap commodities on the state and local levels the deferral of more than half of what congress appropriated this year for tefap would effectively terminate the program even earlier than the president proposes given the growing problem of hunger and homelessness in america today the debate should not be about whether to terminate or continue tefap instead the debate should be about how much to increase funding for this program in conclusion when we consider this supplemental and the urgent assistance also in cluded in the foleymckinney bill h r 558 i hope that we will not simply react to the shortterm crisis created by the unusual weather conditions which we are now experiencing we must also develop permanent longterm solutions to the problems of homelessness in america this will require a sustained commitment and permanent changes in programs which can address this problem including housing assistance improved community mental health services adequate funding of drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs employment and training programs and improvements in

rare we are able to enact legislation such as this provision which so clearly dovetails efforts to develop our coal resources with those aimed at mitigating environmental damage throughout the appalachian region abandoned coal mine lands exist which due to erosion and acidic discharges pose a serious threat to water quality while the 1977 surface mining law created an abandoned mine reclamation program to address this situation the funds raised from industry to implement reclamation projects will never be sufficient to address more than 10 to 20 percent of the nations abandoned coal mine sites because many of these abandoned coal lands still contain valuable coal deposits industry has made an effort to remine them and as such reclaim the sites however in many instances coal remining is not economically and technically feasible because industry becomes liable for treating the preexisting water discharges under stringent national effluent guidelines this coal remining provision will enable industry to enter abandoned coal mine sites and engage in mining under modified water quality standards established on a casebycase basis the end result of this effort will be the reclamation of the site and as such as improvement in water quality over that which existed at the site prior to remining as the author of this coal remining provision i would note that a rather detailed legislative history has been established to assist in its implementation in this regard interested parties should refer to the congressional record of july 23 1985 at which time i provided a

such time as i may consume it is my pleasure to present to you today the fiscal year 1989 military construction and family housing appropriation bill the bill we are recommending amounts to 8 8 billion not included in this bill is a prior year appropriation of 214 million for fiscal year 1989 which when added to the bill amounts to approximately 9 billion the combined total which is used for seorckeeping purposes is 2 million under the presidents request and consistent with the spending limits set in the november 1987 budget summit for both budget authority and outlays some may argue that the bill is over last years level and may want to make reductions for that reason for the members i would like to put several things in perspective regarding this inmay 18 1 988 ti13360 crease first of all if you were to compare the 1989 level with the 1985 funding level you will find that military construction has experienced real negative growth of over 8 percent second during fiscal years 1986 1987 and 1988 significant reductions to the presidents request for military construction in the amount of 5 4 billion were made which is an 18percent reduction this has obviously caused a deferral of many projects which has impacted heavily on the departments ability to upgrade an aging military plant i would like to briefly speak to the departments revitalization and replacement program the military physical plant as it exists today is valued at about 600 billion and averages about 50 years in age the budget as presented is programmed for a 100year replacement schedule as opposed to the acceptable replacement rate of 50 years when you delay replacement of aging structures you create a maintenance and repair problem that costs more money in the end with regard to revitalization of an aging plant i would like to briefly outline for you how this bill should be considered as a wise investment there are many projects and programs in this bill that have pay offs in terms of direct and indirect savings that are not realized in this bill but in other parts of defense for programs which are under jurisdiction of the defense subcommittee for example every new housing unit funded in this bill reduces the housing allowance funded under the military personnel accounts every dilapidated facility replaced in this bill means a reduction in utility consumption and in maintenance and repair funded under the o m account every new maintenance or supply facility means a reduction in manpower costs funded under o m and military personnel appropriations every building that allows the department to move out of leased space means a reduction in annual lease payments funded under the o m account every new energy conservation project means a reduction in operating costs with over 60 percent of this bill being for revitalization projects you can see that this bill is a wise investment that not only provides for readiness but also generates offsetting savings the balance of the bill can be characterized as programs supporting quality of life in the military and projects necessary to house or support new equipment and expensive weapons systems at this point i would like to outline some of the main features of the bill one of the major problems affecting the military construction program in europe is the foreign currency situation as a result of the decline of the dollar there is a military construction shortfall of 300 to 400 million this year the administration refuses to request funds to take care of this problem but instead requests an increase for more overseas projects the committee recommends we appropriate 99 million for the dollar devaluation but offset the increase with reductions of 113 million on overseas projects since i have been chairman of this subcommittee we have been united in demanding that our allies share more of the burden of defense costs for programs in europe and in asia especially when our allies reap many economic benefits from our defense investments and commitments through the years this has been a difficult fight but we have had some success i am glad to finally see the president and secretary carlucci taking the initiative to negotiate for increased burdensharing with our allies likewise im glad to hear the presidental candidates talking about this important issue this bill once again addresses the burdensharing issue in real terms by cutting 25 million in programs that should be funded by our allies as a part of the burdensharing initiative this bill also prohibits the use of any military construction and family housing funds to effect the relocation of the 401st tactical wing from torrejon spain to another country we feel that this should be paid for by nato and or spain on the domestic side this is the third year of funding for strategic homeporting the committee is recommending funds in the amount of 173 million for funding at eight of the nine proposed homeporting sites about 78 million is provided for the initial beddown of the advanced technology bomber at whiteman air force base mo no funds are provided for the requested 31 million for the mx rail garrison facilities at f e warren air force base wy these funds were deferred without prejudice pending a decision of system deployment by the congress and by the next administration after several years of challenging the navys plan for relocation of a naval complex at naples italy the committee has agreed to initial funding for a relocation plan which will save over 100 million from the navys original plan for relocation as long as the national policy is to maintain an allvolunteer force quality of life projects such as new barracks housing and child care centers must be provided to keep the top performers in the service in this bill the committee is recommending 284 million for new housing construction of 3 200 new units plus funds for whole house renovation of existing units that are more than 30 years old this year the committee is taking the initiative to have the department formulate an installment purchase proposal for family housing as an alternative to the government committing itself to expensive leasing for the next 20 to 30 years the committee is also recommending 351 million for barracks to replace world war ii barracks even with this level of funding 245 000 men and

about continuing resolutions it has never been the fault of the committee on appropriations of the house that we have had continuing resolutions it is because our colleagues for various reasons were unable to act on the other side of the capitol in time this year we have again made a determined effort to be sure that if it happens again it is not our fault what the future may bring i do not know reports are that though we have lived up to the limit of the budget on the other side where they insisted that we do that i understand already they are paying very little if any attention to the ceiling that they themselves imposed i would like for the record here to point out what we have to go through in the committee i am proud of the committee on appropriations of the house all 57 members who have to work together and do work together all on 13 subcommittees of which i am a member of each because of the position i hold as chairman of the committee let me repeat here what has happened this year under the law the budget resolution conference report was required to be adopted by april 15 the house lived up to that requirement and passed it on march 23 the senate did also on april 14 then for 53 days they were unable to agree on anything at the insistance of the leadership we had proceeded to handle our bills under the housepassed resolution when the budget conferees finally did agree we were told at the last minute that the senate insisted on a further cut of 1 9 billion so we called the subcommittees back together and we did that we reduced the full 1 9 billion and it took some doing it left this particular subcommittee and others where we were unable to do everything we would like to do within the limits prescribed i think we did a great job and certainly that is true

united states to be doing i would say i would make it clear i was running for president of the united states and not the united nations i would realize that our own country is the backbone and the support for all the rest of it i would recognize there is a difference between productive spending where we get our moneys worth and that which is just wheel spinning i would point out that our money is paper only paper only a promise to pay the only thing behind it is our own country yet may i say the only commendation we have from downtown is in two areas one that we did not have a new start in the public works bill to look after our own country and the other is foreign aid all the rest of our actions in looking after the country have been condemned it is to be remembered that the appropriations committee has consistently held the total of appropriations bills below the overall total requested by the president despite this fact the federal debt in 8 years has increased from 900 billion to 2 6 trillion all this occurred at a time when domestic programs up until this year have been reduced 38 percent iowever these funds have not gone to pay the debt but to increase funds for other spending as you know as chairman of the committee on appropriations i have the responsibility of working out with the chairman of each subcommittee the allocation to each of the subcommittees the total provided for our committee under the budget resolution these amounts are published in our 302 b report which was agreed to by the committee last friday june 10 in approving these allocations the overall committee approved the allocation which made it possible for us to main tain all vital activities and expand in a few high priority areas in this bill the 302 b allocation for the fiscal year 1989 provides 39 752 000 000 for discretionary programs administered by the departments of labor health and human services and education as the gentleman from kentucky an outstanding member of congress has said many times this is the peoples bill and this is where the money belongs this ih a bill which is supported by all of the members of the committee on appropriations when you deal with the health and education of the citizens of this country nothing deserves more attention and the committee agreed that these programs are so important that an adequate allocation must be made in order to support them let us look at some of the programs that are funded in the bill including our junior colleges and many programs for senior colleges i shall not mention all the programs because they have been discussed by the chairman and the ranking minority member i am pleased that we provide an increase of 44 117 000 for vocational education for training and employment services an increase of

other appropriate agencies and private sector groups would identify those professional and technical services which unitedstates government agencies are providing to foreign governments or international markets with federal employees and unfairly competing with unitedstates firms it is my hope these agencies would act as agents for rather than competitors of unitedstates firms the reason for my amendment is the fact that there has been a lack of attention to the unfair competition by federal agencies faced by unitedstates business of all sizes and small businesses in particular in the international market in the professional and technical services areas united states government agencies not german japanese or other foreign firms are the single largest competitors for united states firms these federal agencies aggressively market their services to foreign governments furthermore when foreign governments or other nondomestic entities approach a unitedstates government agency with a requirement for services it is the federal agency that fulfills that requirement with its own personnel this practice represents a major barrier for unitedstates firms attempting to export their services foreign clients become accustomed to getting the required services from the unitedstates government rather than from unitedstates private firms it therefore becomes difficult if not impossible to gain entry into these markets the problem of government competition is particularly critical in the professional and technical services area including such industries as architecture

ability to strike back they may be more likely to take this dramatic move during a future crisis the advantage of midg3tman and rail gardson based mx is that they will be able to move during a cdsls

education programs targeted to our most disadvantaged students and maintains the base of existing education programs that have proven to be essential to maintaining the educational services and aid now in place the 20 6 billion total appropriation for education follows through the congressional commitment made in the fiscal year 1988 budget resolution the bill works within the budget resolutions budget authority and outlay ceilings for education spending the gentleman from mississippi chairman whitten kentucky chairman natcher and massachusetts congressman conte are to be commended for this achievement these distinguished gentlemen and their colleagues on the appropriations committee have done a superb job of achieving budgetary constraint while accentuating both worker training and retraining as well as better education and health care for the benefit of the entire nation i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure no nation can compete no nation can survive in this difficult world if it tries to do so by scanting its citizens of adequate education heafth care and job training if we make arbitrary cuts in these areas future generationsand our national securitywill surely suffer investment in education health care and job training is the key to longterm growth of our economy and longterm deficit reduction on behalf of my fellow west virginians it will be my pleasure to support this legislation and i urge my colleagues to join in offering their support"], [4.00543212890625e-05, 0.5000400543212891, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me clearly there is no dispute that the objective of this waiting period is a worthy one there are certainly people to whom no one would want to sell a handgun under any circumstances and we all seek ways to reduce drugrelated crime or drug use so clearly there is no dispute with regard to the objective of a waiting period but i respectfully suggest to my colleagues that this waiting period as designed in and of itself does not accomplish any of these goals it is not the waiting period that is important let me say that again it is not the waiting period that is important it is the accessibility and the reliability of information about the kinds of people to whom wn do not want to sell the handguns that is important that is the intent the desire the focus of the mccollum amendment the waiting period does not serve the public or the law enforcement community unless the information about convicted felons is accurate unless the information about mental incompetence or those individuals suffering from some kind of mental illness or disability is accurate unless the information about someones residency or citizenship is accessible and accurate there is nothing in this waiting period these 7 days that really gets to the heart of the issue the mccollum amendment seeks to remedy this problem by providing access to reliable information so that we can ensure that if and when a waiting period is utilized and adopted the information needed te make the waiting period effective would be available i think if we knew our law enforcement community had immediate access to this kind of information the need there would probably be even broader bipartisan support but remember we need accessibility and reliability think about it for a moment you can go in and make a purchase with a credit card and they will tell you whether or not your credit card is legitimate or stolen they will tell you whether or not you have exceeded your credit limit hundreds of millions of these transactions occur annually throughout this country our colleague from florida seeks a similar system where we can identify with reliable information the kinds of people to whom none of us would sell these handguns i encourage my colleagues to support the mccollum amendment"], [4.178285598754883e-05, 0.5000417828559875, 0, "reserving the right to object i rise in strong support of the amended version of h r 799 before us today to designate a segment of the kings river in california as a wild and scenic river members may recall that the house unanimously passed this measure on april 21 of this year although the bill was originally controversial since it would have precluded construction of the proposed rodgers crossing dam on the lower stretch of the river the bills sponsor mr lehman and the member in whose district the river lies mr pashayan were able to reach a compromise on this difficult issue under the agreement the lower 11 miles of the river would be included in a 48 000acre special management area allowing it wild and scenic protection from any type of water projects the additional 81 miles of the kings river would be designated as a component of the wild and scenic rivers system i would again like to commend mr lehamn and mr pashayan for their efforts to achieve a resolution of the water conflict which will protect the magnificant resources of the kings river during senate consideration of h r 799 two primary amendments were adopted one establishes an appropriations authorization ceiling of 250 000 for development and land acquisition the other amendment removes the boundary adjustment between the sierra and sequoia national forests for management of the special management area however the bill still requires administration of this area through the sierra national forest these are certainly fair and reasonable changes to the bill therefore i urge my colleagues to concur in the senate amendments and send h r 799 to the white house to ensure timely protection of the beautiful kings river further reserving the right to object i yield to the gentleman from minnesota"]]}
