american families build in their homes by years of faithfully paying a mortgage is the bulk of the net worth the life savings of most homeowners homeownership is more than an investment the deed to a

growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers we must continue the policies that grow our economy and keep our tax bills

extensions that we had passed previously we know that there is a second bill that will come within the next few weeks as we address other extensions of tax reductions we know that these work we know that tax reductions work and we know that this has helped to fuel the economic growth that we are seeing in this country we know that the 18 quarters of sustained economic growth are because this economy is robust we know that the federal government doesnt create jobs it is the free enterprise system that creates these jobs so knowing this and realizing this is the reason that we had the tax relief signed into law last week we have also passed a budget a budget bill that for the second year in a row will put us on the path to deficit reduction this is so important it is important for a

jerseys fight against crime what type of values would raise health costs for many of the over 620 000 veterans in new jersey increasing drug copayments and imposing new enrollment fees that will cost

than this because today i am honored to sponsor this resolution in support of the rights of all iraqis it has been said that a nation reveals its character by the values it upholds in planting the seed of democracy in the deserts of the middle east the united states and our allies hope for a rich harvest of freedom for the people of iraq having removed the dictator the allies have moved to put iraqis in control of iraq now as they draft and ratify their constitution we will indeed see the character of a new iraqi nation revealed through the principles it chooses to uphold that is why i urge the iraqi transitional national assembly to create a government worthy of its people a government that represents every iraqi from every corner of iraq be they sunni or shia rich or poor male or female human rights are not a privilege granted by the few they are a liberty entitled to all and human rights by definition include the rights of all humans those in the dawn of life the dusk of life or the shadows of life the woften of iraq have waited long enough having lived in the shadows of saddams iraq they are eager for the sunlight of a new nation and a new way of life i have met these women and i have felt their courage i have spoken to them and more important i have listened to them i have heard more than their words i have heard their dreams dreams of a peaceful nation where they can raise their children and make decisions on their own and take part in society a free nation must be based on human rights just as our founding fathers built a new republic based on life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so too the iraqi nation must choose to uphold the values of human rights for all indeed most iraqis seem to want this in the runup to the historic january 30 election iraqis insisted that every third name on the ballot had to be that of a woman the result upon election 31 percent of the transitional national assemblys membership was female nearly double the membership of the unitedstates congress by any definition this would be quite an achievement but to understand where iraqs women are consider where they have been to know the horrors of saddam look at how saddam treated the most vulnerable in saddams iraq women were abused and assaulted beaten and battered raped and relegated to secondclass citizens in saddams iraq women could not own property they were property truly saddam hussein was a criminal crying out for international intervention and these are people the iraqi women crying out for freedom history will record that saddam got what he deserved the question is will iraqi women get what they deserve what they have earned what they demand when i met with 20 of these women just weeks before the january election they explained that because they were women they were virtual targets of the people trying to stop the elections because they were running for office more than half had had members of their families kidnapped or assassinated almost all had to have bodyguards many had been in exile for years because of their beliefs their education and their choice to have a career yet they persevered they persevered because they knew their election was proof that freedom works and they persevered because they knew that the more women elected the less the chance of a saddamstyle policy toward women would ever again come to iraq e 1330 proudly defiantly and amazingly these women had the courage of their convictions and changed history some of the very women we met with before the election who were so fearful of the outcome and proposed violence led their village walking miles to cast their votes then weeks after that vote i led another delegation to join 150 iraqi women who were leaders in their communities and their sects who came to a conference to hear us talk about the principles and practices of democracy women all over iraq were given the opportunity to apply to be a part of that conference do the women of iraq want democracy well 1 200 of them signed applications hoping to be chosen for this conference that is right 1 200 iraqi women put their names in a document stating who they were and where they lived that they wanted to learn about democracy from the united states of america but while the election of so many iraqi women last january gives us great hope recent reports about the drafting of the constitution give us great concerns with so many reports and rumors perhaps it is best to take inventory of what we know as well as what we fear we know that islam allows for rights for women but we fear the interpretation of religious lava might unfairly discriminate against women we know that a policy of equal rights for women in the constitution would safeguard iraqi women today and for generations to come but we fear that extremist elements might prevent the passage of such a constitutional protection and we note that the surest way to limit the future and the progress of iraq is to limit the rights and protections of women but we fear that women may not be allowed even basic rights on matters of marriage divorce economic opportunity or politipal involvement the people of iraq deserve better and the women of iraq demand more let me be blunt american troops have come so far sacrificed so much persevered so long to see the tyranny of an unlawful dictator replaced by the tyranny of legal oppression for women a free iraq must be free for all iraqis a democracy in the middle east must be more than a democracy in name only it must live out its principles freedom is not something that can be limited or divided or restricted it applies to anyone and everyone anywhere and everywhere so i put forward this resolution and urge my colleagues not to just

worked together so well on a wide range of very important issues i also want to extend my congratulations to our commander in chief george w bush and our great secretary of defense donald rumsfeld it is very clear that the united states of america over the past few years has gone through challenges the likes of which we have never in our nations history seen frankly i believe that we are doing extraordinarily well the defense authorization bill that we are going to be considering today will create an opportunity for a free flowing debate a wideranging discussion on important issues that we face eightynine amendments were submitted to the committee on rules for consideration by 10 oclock yesterday morning and i am happy to say that of those 89 amendments we have been able to take 29 of them and make them in order of those 29 16 amendments were offered by democrats that will be made in order 13 will be offered by republicans and they will deal with the tough issues that we have faced now the issue that my friend the gentlewoman from rochester new york just raised is one which has been contentious and i believe we have been able to come to a consensus on the issue there was a great deal of stir over this question of women in combat and what exactly we were going to do the managers amendment throws out the provisions that the committee had and it put into place a requirement that over a 60 legislative day period the united states congress will be involved in any kind of change in the policy of women in combat that will be on the horizon secretary rumsfeld has made it very clear publicly that he does not support any kind of change and i believe that the action that we will see in the passage of the managers amendment will help to ensure that that will take place i also have to say that we are in a position today where we have just gotten the report issued from the base realignment and closure commission and we know that there are concerns that have come to the forefront from a number of our members on the recommendations of the brac commission as we begin debate on this bill we will allow for a wideranging discussion on the issue of base realignment and

something to complete it or to bring it to fruition an emergency just ran out and grabbed the dictionary meaning an unexpected serious occurrence or situastion urgently requiring prompt action well unfortunately the language in the bill in this area of additional foreign aid is not an unexpected situation or emergent that is just not my opinion that is actually the opinion of the committee itself the language that we seek to strike is approximately 15 million in additional foreign aid 5 million to expand public diplomacy information programs relating to iran and 10 million in democracy funds for the promotion of democracy governance human rights independent media and the rule of law in iran iran is certainly not an ally of this nation that we are here tonight to seek assistance of 15 million again not my opinion that it is not an ally of this country this administration itself called iran part of the axis of evil iran who wants to wipe israel off the map of the world iran who wants to assist hamas in any wak they possibly can iran who neglects and fails to listen to the worlds heed and continues to expand its nuclear program and yet tonight we have a supplemental program of approximately 15 million to assist that nation again i say that this is not my opinion that this is not an emergency situation the committee in its report says that it is disappointed in the department of states failure to provide adequate and timely justification of the emergency nature of these funds if the state department then cannot supply us and cannot supply the committee with the very information that it needs to say that this truly is an emergency situation why then is this house considering providing an additional 15 million to support iran the rest of the supplemental obviously has worthwhile programs in it we are trying to assist our men and women overseas who find themselves in harms way as we speak here tonight with military assistance we are trying to assist those people down in the gulf coast to rebuild their lives with katrina aid but at the same time we have articles such as this added to this christmas tree list if you will of programs to the

reconciliation i am amazed by some of my colleagues who continue their steady drumbeat of support for increased taxes and increased spending this is a dangerous philosophy and will only destroy jobs and opportunities for working americans we cannot tax and spend the deficit away we cannot strengthen the economy with a taxandspend mentality we in the majority will never let me repeat never accept taxandspend policies as fiscally sound and fundamentally fair for the american taxpayer the other side tries to hide their intentions for increased taxes by using phrases like rolling back the tax cuts but they cannot fool the american people because when they say rolling back they mean increasing taxes for working americans and small businesses rolling back means killing the almost 2 5 million jobs created over the past year rolling back means reversing the economic growth that has helped improve the lives of all americans rolling back the tax cuts means rolling over the american taxpayer

gains and dividends to relief to the alternative minimum tax this budget puts money back into the pockets of american workers while funding our nations priorities and cutting the budget deficit this budget also ensures the continued strength of our armed forces and homeland security through providing an increase in defense and homeland spending for the first time since 1997 this budget will

floor the culture of corruption that we have seen in this chamber on capitol hill and now we have come to find that this is also extended into the executive branch the republican oneparty rule inevitably when one party controls all the levers of government inevitably it leads to corruption and today we saw another taste of that my friend from florida is here and before we get into the corruption and the cronyism that has been going on in the way that this government has just been corrupted i want to talk for a few minutes about what our friend was saying who was here prior to us i want to make this perfectly clear the republicans control the house of representatives the republicans control the senate the republicans control the white house we have a oneparty government here in washington dc i find it humorous and sometimes hysterical that the other side can look over to the democrats and blame us for all the big spending and all the deficits they look over here and they point to my friends on the left we do not have any power we are not running the government oneparty rule take responsibility for your own actions my friend who was here prior was talking about all the democrats want to do is spend the republican majority has borrowed and spent this countrg almost all the way into bank ruptcy our national debt just went to 8 trillion the republicans have controlled this house since 1994 they have had the white house since 2000 and the senate on and off but it had control of the senate for the past few years they have been able to implement their agenda and they keep saying that we want to raise taxes we do not want to raise taxes we want to reduce spending here as the rhetoric came from the other side but we do not want to do it on the backs of the middle class we want to reduce corporate welfare to the tune of 16 billion in the two energy bills sixteen billion dollars we voted to subsidize oil companies and they are coming out with the highest profits that they have had in a long long time record profits just in the last quarter we want to end corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies 700 billion in spending on a medicare prescription drug bill that does nothing to reduce the cost of prescription drugs democrats wanted reimportation from canada to help reduce the cost democrats wanted to give the secretary of health and human services the ability to negotiate down drug prices by basically going on behalf of all of the medicare recipients to merck and pfizer and all of these big drug companies and basically say if you want a contract let us talk price if we took 10 or 20 percent of the savings of that bill 700 billion over the next 10 years if we saved 10 percent that is 70 billion which would pay for hurricane katrina but we could save closer to 20 or 30 percent which would be 140 billion of the taxpayers money that we could save we do not want to raise taxes now do we think that we should be giving tax cuts to bill gates and warren buffett and at the same time cut medicaid which is a health care program for poor kids and poor families meanwhile middleclass americas health care is going up 1520 percent my god we cannot do anything to help average people because we have to take care of the big corporations and keep the corporate welfare going let me say this before we get back to our message this is very simple to connect the dots this body taxes the american people the american people send their money down here the republican congress gives that money to the tune of 16 billion in the last few months to the energy companies can you imagine your tax dollars going to subsidize oil companies american tax dollars coming down here and the republican majority takes it and gives it to the pharmaceutical companies to buy prescription drugs for seniors great idea but is it a good policy not to do anything about controlling the costs what the republican majority does is then they go to the shakedown street which is k street where all of the lobbyists are they go and shake down all the lobbyists who they just spent a bunch of tax dollars on and the lobbyists who they shake down fill up the republican campaign committee coffers to the tune of millions and millions and millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars is spent lobbying this is corrupt to the core this is not the way to govern we understand there is money in politics but to use the hardworking publics money that average people send down here and to give it to corporations is atrocious our good friend cal

not start with the poor to pay for hurricane katrina start with the rich he goes on to say which i tend to forget about the corporate subsidies to the big agribusinesses this is cal thomas not the

was very much concerned about dealing with the alternative minimum tax problem facing millions of american taxpayers we were also concerned primarily on this side of the aisle with making sure that the economy continued its robust growth i am very pleased to announce today that there should be near unanimous support on the other side of the aisle for this reconciliation agreement when we offered the alternative minimum tax outside of reconciliation we got 414 votes for providing that alternative minimum tax relief outside of reconciliation subsequenit to the house passing the reconciliation

my pleasure to announce today that the wishes of my friends on the other side of the aisle have been granted the alternative minimum tax in the most comprehensive way ever offered is part of this package because it is so comprehensive that more than 15 million americans will not pay the alternative minimum tax once this bill becomes law in 2006 and that in addition more than 2 million taxpayers will not have any liability because of this bill because of its comprehensive nature this is the only opportunity for members of the house to vote to provide alternative minimum tax relief to taxpayers and so i look forward to having my colleagues join me since we have provided in the reconciliation package what they have voted for and have asked for i am also pleased to announce to my friends on both side of the aisle that this measure also contains a provision which extends one of the primary stim ulus factors in the economy and that is the ability to pay only a 15 percent tax on dividends for investing in the economy and 15 percent on capital gains for taking a risk opportunity in the economy i will say for those items that were in both the house and the senate bills that are not part of this package we are working on an additional important tax relief package which will provide that opportunity and i know my colleagues on the other sides of the aisle especially those who represent the states that will see the greatest relief under the alternative minimum tax those members who represent the states of california new york florida pennsylvania massachusetts new jersey they will be pleased to note that a yes vote on this reconciliation measure provides the tax relief and i might underscore the only opportunity for tax relief on the alternative minimum tax measure i might say in the reverse that if a member does not vote for this measure they are in essence then voting to raise taxes on more than 15 million americans i reserve the balance of my time"],

you all must remove saddam we cant do it he said because we know what he is capable of doing to us in retaliation i said to him if we do remove him will you embrace us or will you kick us he said i dont know i responded that is my concern i dont know either i believe his antisaddam remarks at that time represented a majority view in iraq but my concern proved prophetic our exercise in iraq and colleagues has not been without mistakes our entry strategy was superb our postentry strategy was tentative at best inept at worst a better response to the looting that ensued in the early days should have been in place the disestablishment of the army without an alternative plan in my opinion was premature some would blame the united states for the delayed political development but after all our forefathers were deliberate in forming our countrys operational apparatus so i think the political complaint is probably unfounded was saddam an evil brutal murderer a flagrant violator of human rights you bet was he involved in international terrorism you bet was he directly or iidirectly involved in the 9 11 attack i dont know i oan neither confirm nor reject that theory my point is that intelligence was flawed mistakes were made but the cause for freedom is a noble one and progress has indeed been realized i am concerned and colleagues about the lack of objectivity in reporting the war on terrorism some liberal talk show host reports imply that no good has been accomplished conversely some conservative talk show hosts portray baghdad as moonlight and roses clearly these two slanted versions are inaccurate and unfair di 2100 let me say a word about the patriot act and this will be discussed in more detail subsequently but the patriot act was reported in the full house by the judiciary committee and it addressed the nexus of the sale of illicit narcotics and terrorist financing these two shadowy worlds of narcotics trafficking and terrorism is an element of terrorism that i think is lost on many americans they are joined at the hip and i am particularly pleased that the patriot act did respond to that end seventeen months ago i publicly indicated that troop withdrawal was conspicuously absent when the war on terrorism was discussed oh we spoke of appropriating more funds we spoke of dispatching additional troops but virtually no one ever even remotely included troop withdrawal in their discussions now i am not suggesting troop withdrawal tomorrow but i want our armed servicemen and women home sooner rather than later some may declare oh we cannot cut and run cut and run we have had a presence in iraq in excess of 3 years 2 500 armed services americans have given the ultimate sacrifice to the cause of freedom thousands of permafient and disabling injuries have been inflicted upon members of our armed services in addition to the spending of billions of dollars i do not know what constitutes cutting and running but i do know that when we have logged a wartime duration of 3 years when 2 500 americans have given their lives for freedom and lord only knows how many americans have been injured this does not constitute cutting and running the time has come it seems to me to pass the baton to the iraqi government now this decision will ultimately be made militarily and properly so by the commanders on the ground but i do not

i can certainly agree with the sentiment that was expressed and the spirit of this resolution with respect to hoping for constitutional democracies i think we need to look at the letter of the resolution and put it in the context of the administrations policies first of all this particular resolution expresses its profound hope that the people of iran will once again enjoy a democratic government in the spirit of the iranian constitution of 1906 i would like to read from some research that is available on the web recent iranian fistory from wikipedia it says that with the rise of modernization in the late 19th century desire for change led to 4he persian constitutional revolution of 1905 to 1911 in 1921 reza shah pahlavi staged a coup against the weakened qajar dynasty during world war ii britain and the ussr invaded iran from august 25 to september 17 1941 to stop an axissupported coup and secure irans petroleum infrastructure the allies of world war ii forced the shah to abdicate in favor of his son mohammad reza pahlavi whom they hoped would be more supportive in 1951 a prodemocratic nationalist dr mohammed mossadegh rose to prominence in iran now mossadegh was elected its first prime minister as prime minister mossadegh alarmed the west by his nationalization of an angloiranian oil company that was later named bp which controlled all the countrys oil reserves britain immediately put an embargo on iran members of british intelligence service approached the united states under president eisenhower in 1953 to join them in operation ajax a coup against mossadegh president eisenhower agreed and authorized the cia to assist the bis in overthrowing mossadegh the shah at first attempted to formally dismiss mossadegh but this backfired and mossadegh convinced the shah to flee to baghdad regardless of this setback thecovert operation soon went into full swing conducted from the unitedstates embassy in tehran under theleadership of kermit roosevelt jr agents were hired to facilitate violence and as a result protests broke out across the nation antiand promonarchy protesters violently clashed in the streets leaving almost 300 dead the operation was successful in triggering a coup and within days proshah tanks stormed the capital and bombarded the prime ministers residence mossadegh surrendered and was arrested on the 19th of august 1953 tried for treason and sentenced to 3 years in prison now keep in mind that on march 8 of 1951 mossadegh submitted to the iranian mullahs his proposal to nationalize trans oil according to the cornell university library the angloiranian oil company most of whose stock was owned by the british government had been paying iran much less than the british government took from the company in taxes mossadeghs nationalization bill scared the company into concessions that were made too late the premier was committed to nationalization much to the surprise of the british he went through with it right down to the expulsion of british technicians without whom the iranians could not run the abadan refinery results the west lost the iranian oil supply and the iranian government lost the oil payments when we are talking about democracy in iran iran had a democratic government which was overthrown because of oil so lets celebrate democracy and not try to at the same time praise a process that resulted in an overthrow of democracy i think when we look at this particular resolution you have to read these resolutions to the letter to get an idea of what is going on here here we are expressing the profound hope that the people of iran will once again enjoy a democratic government in the spirit of the iranian constitution of 1906 they had a democratic government the unitedstates helped overthrow it one of the last resolutions we talked about initiating an active and consistent dialogue with other governments in the european union in order to persuade the government of iran to rectify its human rights practices we should be talking to the government of iran if we object to their human rights practices resolution 415 says human rights will be considered a significant factor in the foreign policy of the united states with regard to iran but we are not stating that with the other countries that have violated the human rights of their citizens my concern is that while these resolutions in and of themselves may have elements that are salutary at the same time you have to put them in the context of the administrations policy which is a buildup to war against iran that is why i am raising a note of caution here you have to see why we have three resolutions on the floor of the house dealing with iran on the same day our president is before the united nations making a statement which characterizes iran in much the same way that iraq was characterized before the united nations in another visit by the president i think we have to be very cautious about the path this country is taking we can stand for democracy and human rights in iran we can do all of those things without taking steps and letting our efforts which might be in good faith by the way without letting those efforts be used as a buildup towards war i am saying look at all of this in the context in which it is occurring look at time magazine this week and look at the stories that have been published in the new yorker watch the development of this administration with respect to covert activities in iran you might be inter6sted to know that our house subcommittee on government operations which has jurisdiction over national security and international relations we were supposed to have a classified briefing by the state department and by the department of defense on this issue on what is going on in iran they refused to appear they still refuse to appear they are not accountable to congress i am raising this issue so my colleagues know that you have to look at the context in which these
