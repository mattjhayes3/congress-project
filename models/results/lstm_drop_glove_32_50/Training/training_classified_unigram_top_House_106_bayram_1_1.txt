that nothing could be further from the truth political leaders and statesmen who created the wto and its predecessor the gatt did so for good reasons they had lived through some of the darkest days in the history of the world famine poverty war that dominated the lives of millions of people around the world protectionism and economic stagnation put millions of americans outof work factories closed homes were lost families were destroyed they witnessed the havoc which trade wars and military wars and the protectionism that comes from trade wars can bring and they vowed not to let it happen again so they created an organization whose sole purpose was to open up closed markets promote economic growth provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of trade disputes this was the gatt the predecessor to the wto and it worked since world war ii the world has experienced unprecedented economic growth millions of people around the world have been pulled from economic poverty but the system certainly was not perfect so we tried to correct some of the deficiencies of the past by creating the wto which would further liberalize trade and provide for an even stronger dispute settlement procedure again i believe the system has worked especially for the united states in the first year of implementation unitedstates exports rose 14 4 percent seven h4796 co tines greater than the gdp growth in that same year when fully implemented it is estimated that the agreement establishing the wto will add somewhere between 125 and 250 billion each year to the gdp of this country i agree that it is still not perfect it is an evolving institution but what is it supporters of this resolution disapprove of tariff cuts opening export markets peaceful dispute resolution economic growth full employment and if this is what they disapprove of what exactly is the alternative that they propose it is easy to criticize it is easy to point fingers to lambaste but what is the proposed alternative i have yet to hear anyone that can prove to me that there is a better way than to proceed with the wto we will be hearing a lot today about how our antidumping laws are the cornerstone of unitedstates trade policy critical to our economic growth that they are responsible for the prosperity we experience today i say baloney to that our antidumping laws are more often than not little more than special interest

to solve this problem and they did not so now we have tackled it and i think it takes political courage we provide taxpayers a subsidy to encourage insurers to offer policies which are affordable to our seniors one key aspect about our program it is voluntary and seniors taking part can choose from at least two plans all plans start with a 250 deductible and it would establish the medicare benefits administration this is an agency that would run the program but it would be private sectororiented and provide volume buying for these seniors it would cover 100 percent of drug and premium

would control the drug purchasing contractor for every region of this country hcfa would be doing it in other words it would be a new big government program a onesizefitsall plan and this is a key element of their program in a recent survey done with seniors talking about drug coverage they prefer by a margin of two to one a program that is private sectororiented that is voluntary and not

discuss why this is important to americans and how come a nationwide grass roots effort has worked towards its passage first of all i would like to reference this chart according to the department of justice the average time actually served by a rapist in this country and released from state prison is 5h years for molesting a child 4 years and for murder 8 years this is outrageous it is unconscionable we have to act today to change this it is not as if these criminals are suddenly boy scouts after their release from prison the recidivism rates for sex offenders are very high i think most people agree once a molester always a molester as the department of justice found in 1997 over the 3year period following the prison release an estimated 52 percent of discharged rapists and 48 percent of other sexual assaulters were rearrested for a new crime here is that statistic many of those go on to commit other sex offenses light sentencea for todays most heinous crimes contribute to an epidemic of completely yes i said it completely preventable crimes consider each year more than 14 000 rapes molestations and murders occur every year by somebody who was let out of prison for committing that exactsame crime in some 1 700 of these cases individual cross state lines and then reoffend again we talk a lot about accountability in this chamber it is time to restore some accountability to states that release these dangerous predators into our neighborhoods aimees law would add an additional factor to the formula for distributing federal crime funds to the states specifically the amendment would provide additional funding to states that convict a murderer rapist child molester if that criminal had previously been convicted of one of those same crimes in a differ~nt state the cost of prosecuting and incarcerating that criminal would be deducted from the federal crime assistance funds intended to go to the first state in other words the state that is irresponsible lets the rapist murderer molester out and then they cross state lines and reoffend again a portion would be taken away from their crime assistance funds and given to the new state enough to cover the costs of incarceration prosecution and apprehension of that monster a safe harbor would not require the funds transfer if the criminal has served 85 percent of his original sentence and if the first state was a truthinsentencing state with a higher than average typical sentence for the crime aimees law a bipartisan effort from day one passed the senate last week with a whopping 81 to 17 vote aimees law is enthusiastically supported by law enforcement and victims rights groups nationwide here is just a smattering of those who are supportive the law enforcement community in particular they understand the need for this legislation they are in the trenches they are fighting this fight every day the nations largest police union the national fraternal order of police representing some 250 000 brave police officers nationwide has strongly backed this amendment and has appeared at all public events to help push for its passage their president has said the bill addresses this issue smartly without infringing on the states and without federalizing crimes among the other law enforcement groups that have endorsed the bill is the california correctional police officers association and some of the others members can see victims rights and child advocacy groups have also endorsed the bill and made this one of the most important issues that they focus on child help unitedstatesa klaas kids foundation kids safe mothers outraged at molester and the list goes on and on and on from around the country americans have signed petitions called our offices and sent emails demanding passage of aimees law even dr laura is urging her 18 million listeners across america and has been doing it all week also including it on her web site for a call to action on this

sentence aimee willard would still be alive today aimee was an allamerican college athlete who wanted to work with children we are never going to know all that we lost when she was taken from us but we should do what we can to prevent others from enduring the same kind of pain and agony and following her to a needlessly early grave many courageous victims and survivors have made extraordinary

initiated title ix over 20 years ago their contributions in support of equal opportunity for women have been invaluable signed into law in 1972 title ix is the landmark civil rights law that banned sex discrimination in schools in both academics and athletics while the law applied to all education programs in schools receiving federal aid it has become best known for expanding athletic opportunities for women since title ixs passage womens participation in intercollegiate sports has skyrocketed when tire ix was first passed there were 31 000 women participating in intercollegiate athletics today that number is over 120 000a fourfold increase a recent survey showed that the number of womens collegiate teams have risen from 5 6 teams per school in 1977 to 7 5 in 1996 simply put title ix has been a smashing success for womens collegiate sports which were virtually nonexistent in the early 1970s but critics still like to lambaste title ix alleging that its decimated mens sports or gone too far lets put these tired old myths about title ix to rest myth 1 title ix enforces quotas against men nothing could be further from the truth title ix forbids quotas it simply prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs that means female students must have equal opportunities to participate in education programs including athletics utilizing a threeprong test schools can show they comply with title ix by fulfilling one of three requirements offering schools flexibility and ample room for title ix compliance myth 2 title ix will cause the elimination of mens collegiate sports title ix does not require schools to cut mens sports nor has title ix ever forced a school to eliminate a mens sports program to meet compliance many schools have decided to cut teams in mens minor sports such as gymnastics and wrestling for a combination of reasons including budget constraints changes in student interest alumni support liability or risk of injury lets not forget that football and basketball budgets consume a whopping 69 of the average division ia schools mens athletic operating budget perhaps title ix critics should point their finger at poor fiscal management or excessive support for one sportnot at title ixfor the decline in mens sports myth 3 title ix has gone too far despite title ixs successes we still have a long way to go the fact is that womens athletics continue to lag behind mens programs compared to men female athletes have only 38 of scholarships from 19921997 mens athletic budgets in division 1a alone increased by 139 in contrast womens budget increased during this time period by 89 from fewer scholarships to inferior athletic equipment and facilities the playing field for female athletes is far from level we need title ix now more than ever finally the latest myth about title ix is this title ix cannot be credited for the countrys stunning success in womens soccer because we produced the finest soccer players through independent youth leagues outside the scope of title ix let me quote a recent article in the latest edition of the conservative magazine the weekly standard title ix could not possibly have had anything to do with the teams success seven of this years eleven starters all joined the unitedstates national squad as teenagers in the 1980stitle ixs dark ages where do title ix critics think these women played while they were collegeage they played at universities with topnotch college soccer teams it is the heralded successes of the university of north carolinas womens soccer team the university of tennessees womens basketball team and other division ia teams and their recruitment of top female high school athletes that has been a driving force in promoting athletic programs at the high school level both public and private in fact in high school the number of female athletes has jumped from 294 000 in 1971 to 2 4 million in 1995 indeed title ix has sent the message to our young women that they have far more opportunities to compete at the college level and to qualify for college scholarships than any prior generation in closing title ix has helped put womens sports on the map including swimming gymnastics softball lacrosse field hockey track and field basketball and soccer but perhaps title ixs most important triumph is that it tells our girls that they can be and

from california the ranking member and the gentleman from maryland for putting this matter on the floor at this particular time before i begin my remarks i would like to mention that the gentleman from california the gentleman from california and the gentlewoman from california have cosponsored this legislation we certainly appreciate the bipartisan effort on putting this on the floor i rise today in great sadness to pay tribute to a very distinguished leader to one of the most outstanding public servants that i have known and to a true friend on sunday november 7 the mayor of sacramento joe serna lost his courageous battle with kidney cancer as the sacramento community mourns his loss i ask all my colleagues to join with me in saluting his career and his efforts as one of the most extraordinary persons that i have ever known joe was only 60 years old when he passed on that november day joe was the son of immigrant farm workers from whom he learned the values and work ethics that exemplified his career his sister said during the rosary service last week that when his mother brought joe home she put him in a crate because they could not afford a crib from that kind of beginning he earned his bachelor of arts degree in social science in government from sacramento state college in 1966 and he received a higher degree at the university of california at davis in political science always wanting to serve others he entered as the gentleman from maryland said the peace corps and worked in guatemala as a community development coordinator and volunteer specializing in cooperatives and credit unions upon his return he continued his service to others by becoming a teacher he joined the faculty at cal state university sacramento and in 1969 became a full professor in government the energy he brought to life was transferred to his students in the classroom and in 1991 he received the distinguished faculty award at cal state university continuing his calling in public service he was elected to the sacramento city council in 1981 reelected in 1985 and again in 1989 in 1992 he was elected mayor of sacramento and was re elected by huge margins in 1996 he leaves a proud legacy of leadership and accomplishments most significantly he worked throughout his career to revitalize sacramentos downtown he initiated the sacramento downtown partnership association the art in public places program and the thursday night market all of which have made the downtown area a thriving gathering place for all sacramentoans as a result in 1995 the mayor received the economic development leadership award from the national council for urban economic development but his legacy was most proud in the area of public education as the gentleman from maryland had said earlier in response to the erosion of our communitys education system mayor serna established the mayors commission on education and the citys future a coalition of business and civic leaders the mayors commission successfully led the recall of members of the board of trustees 6f the sacramento city unified school district and elected a new board i am pleased to say that the achievement results since that time of our high school middle school and grammar school children have increased which indicates that his efforts were not in vain but will help future generations of children in sacramento his education drive was one of many challenges that are identified under his leadership for example when the national basketball association sacramento kings threatened to leave sacramento he began negotiating with the kings organization members of the city council and community leaders to forge a role in keeping that basketball franchise in our community not so much for the purpose of having a major sports franchise but because he knew that having a major sports franchise would create an enthusiasm in the community and bring all segments of our community together when our military base closed the sacramento army depot and had 3 000 employees joe rather than curse the darkness he lit a candle he immediately sought businesses down in los angeles and actually brought up a hightech industry and business that created 6 000 jobs for many people who were then on public assistance programs and now are gainfully employed over the past three decades he served on numerous commissions too many for me to mention today but just as an example of his diverse leadership he was cotrustee of the crocker art museum he was a member of the sacramento housing and redevelopment commission he was on the board of the sacramento employment and training agency the metropolitan cable television commission and the air quality board of sacramento county but beyond his accomplishments he was known simply as an elected official with a profound vision for the future and an energy to implement that vision he knew how to build coalitions ignite community involvement and succeeded blmost always in achieving his goals because of this vision he leaves a proud legacy in sacramentos downtown redevelopment area of growth a stronger public school system more jobs more community police and certainly a higher quality of life his parting has left a major void for all of us in sacramento county people of all walks of life four thousand people attended his service last week people in business suits and people that were dressed as ordinary citizens i wish to extend on behalf of this institution our deepest sincerity and heartfelt wishes to mayor sernas wife isabelle his son phillip

increased from a lofty 125 000 per season to a hefty 200 000 per season at the time unbelievably making him the highest paid baseball player in baseball history he accomplished all of this despite the enormous amount ofhate mail received prior to breaking babe ruths record if anyone has had an opportunity to listen to mr aaron talk about the pain that he felt during the time that he was trying to break the record if one could hear him talk about the threats that were made on his life and the threats made on his familys life one would have to add another very important word to describe him he is indeed a courageous man for he went out and he did what he had to do anyway and while he was doing it it may have caused him pain but it surely brought him glory and it surely put an imprint a

baseball were not there and he has made a tremendous commitment never to forget from whence he has come he has made a commitment and he has synchronized his conduct with his conscience by lifting others up as he has gone up the ladder of life the hank aaron rookie league coordinated with the atlanta housing authority has gotten many youngsters off the street and on to the playing fields he has also worked extensively with big brothers and big sisters organizations throughout our country despite all that he has done hank aaron does not classify himself as a role model because of his athletic

is a role model to my seven brothers and sisters i played baseball i just happened to have a gift that i was blessed with but hank aaron the baseball player is not necessarily a role model hank aaron

matter is one of the federal governments most fundamental constitutional functions the united states census at stake is our gop majority in the house of representatives as well as partisan control of state legislatures nationwide the clinton administration is implementing a radical new way of taking the next census that effectively will add nearly four and onehalf million democrats to the nations population this is the political outcome of a controversial executive decision to use a complex mathematical formula to estimate and adjust the 2000 census using this process democrats gain a critical advantage in the next redistricting that will undermine gop efforts to elect republicans to both federal and state offices a reliable analysis done for the rnc by polidata political analysis reveals that a statistically altered census will have a sweeping political impact that clearly imperils the partys present congressional majority the gop would suffer a negative effect in the partisan makeup of 24 congressional seats 113 state senate seats and 297 state house seats nationwide a statebystate summary is attached for your reference many of these legislative districts are in states where majorities are held by only the narrowest of margins an adjusted census could provide democrats the crucial edge needed to prevail in close contests to control several state legislative chambers the census does have problems and improvements are needed to insure a successful effort but an adjusted census ignores the constitutions call for an actual enumeration republican leaders are committed to providing the needed resources for a complete count as directed by the founders census adjustment raises many legal ethical and technical concerns yet democrats faithfully promote it as the solution

debating authorization now when we are already heavily involved the administration is conducting a war without congressional consent as required by the constitution a vote to authorize the president to conduct military air strikes at this juncture is nothing more than a rubber stamp from congress for an action that has already begun i my opinion our inaction prior to military strikes abdicated

merely a distant goal we seek but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal we must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means all of this is saying that in the final analysis means and ends must cohere because the end is preexistent in the means and ultimately destructive means cannot bring about constructive ends the administrations policy and the nato campaign in kosovo to date have produced only counterproductiveand destructive results a mass exodus of over half a million ethnic albanians significant civilian deaths an escalation of milosevics campaign of racial hatred and terror and greater instability in the region the results are just the opposite of what we want to achieve our goal is to prevent innocent people from being killed in the name of saving kosovars we are

and nato must reach out to the united nations russia china and others to work together to develop a new internationally negotiated peace agreement and to secure serbian compliance to its terms in

thousands of north korean troops invaded south korea pouring across the 38th parallel and precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun

congress i wanted to speak because many of the people in our region even though we were not represented officially by mo udall in the congress certainly have considered him a leader on many of the issues of concern to our area he had political alliances with the burton family in san francisco and now that i represent san francisco i wanted to speak for my constituents in honoring mo udall i think that any of us who served with mo would say that one of the great privileges of our political lives was to be able to call him a colleague he served with such great intellect and of course humor as we have all heard he was a teacher to us in many ways as a colleague and he was a teacher of course in his later years with the dignity with which he faced his challenge we are very fortunate i know that mo was very pleased with the gentleman from arizona coming to congress to serve the great state of arizona and i also know we all know what a thrill and what a joy it was to mo to have his son mark and his nephew tom serve in this congress what a perfect way for his life to end to see the tradition of greatness and dignity live on in this body and lord knows where the tradition will go from here i wanted to make one point about the environment however because as we all know mo was born in desert country but he fell in love with the snowcapped alaska wilderness and its vast beauty that was so unlike his roots after a trip there mo spent a good portion of his service in congress dedicated to the protection of the great alaskan wilderness he was responsible for the alaska native claims settlement act which transferred 55 million acres of land to the alaska natives and he was successful in imposing a prohibition on energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge i

represented his area so well he was a leader for our entire great country morris k udall mo to everyonewas a giant in this congress and in all aspects of his life after dedicating a lifetime to protecting our national treasures he became one born in the desert country he fell in love with the snowcapped alaska wilderness and its vast beauty that was so unlike his roots after a trip there mo

million acres of land to alaskas natives and he was successful in imposing a prohibition on energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge i am pleased to note that one of my constituents 92yearold dr edgar waybum of the sierra club worked tirelessly with chairman udall to protest these lands mo udalls contributions to protecting our environment and preserving the american landscape reached far beyond arizona and his work has touched all our lives and the lives of our children in congress we will continue to work to honor mos memory and seek passage of the morris k udall wilderness act to provide permanent protection to the arctic national wildlife refuge in the last congress this legislation had 150 cosponsors it is the most appropriate means to honor this great congressman and environmentalist you might think a person would lose their sense of humor after suffering defeatnot so for mo udall success eluded him in his run in the presidential primaries of 1976 and in his two runs at election for house speaker mo never abandoned his humor if youre running for leadership youve got to know the difference between a cactus and a caucus we are particularly fortunate to have mos son mark serving in congress to carry on the udall tradition with his cousin tom mark has stated about his father he taught me that humor is essential to the workings of a strong democracy he taught me to take your work seriously but not yourself too seriously i am pleased to serve with the new udall team in congress mo udall imparted great lessons to all of us on vietnam i am unhappy because we are involved in this war at all as far as i am concemed it is the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time on environmental stewardship we hear a lot of talk about our american heritage and what well leave our children and grandchildren the ancient athenians had an oath that read in part we will transmit this city not only not less but greater and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us mo udall may have lost many battles and his greatest last battle against parkinsons disease but he was a winner for our nation and leaves a legacy of outstanding leadership a model for all of us serving in congress before his death mo was honored with the presidential medal of freedom in 1996 our country is blessed by his life from 1922 to 1998 and from his

family this meeting and discussions with many people in cuba who know the family have convinced me unequivocally that elian does have a loving fit and equipped family and that he should be returned to his father immediately there is no way that a child should not be with his or her parents because of material things that we value in this country in our own country for example 18 9 percent of our

that we cannot evaluate elians situation in material terms because there is nothing more valuable than the love of a father and the support of a family unit now i am greatly concerned that in addition

interviews protests and the relentless exposure to the media that has really only exacerbated the already extremely stressful and disorienting circumstances elians health and his welfare must be our first priority we must consider the potentially damaging and adverse impact of all of this negative activity i urge for elians expeditious return to his family his father his community and his familiar environment it is my fear that the longer that this battle continues the more elian and his family will be harmed emotionally the decision of whether to return elian to his family in cuba should not be a political decision it should be a decision that exclusively supports the best interest of the child and his need to be reunited with his father the time that i spent with elians

massachusetts and i and so many others came to the floor in 1992 to try to create the capacity of direct broadcast satellite to bring television programming to america was because at the time we had just gotten through deregulating the cable companies we in congress had taken away the power of local franchising authorities to regulate the monopoly cable company we thought it was pretty important if we were going to be responsible for taking away the power of local governments to regulate the monopoly cable company that we ought to make sure consumers in america had a competitive choice that is what it was all about in 1992 we had to fight our way over a presidential veto to accomplish that goal but we accomplished it we created the capacity of television satellitesto deliver satellite programming in competition with cable hut we left one thing undone and that was the capacity of those satellites to include the local network programming in the package so guess what satellites were born direct broadcast satellite came into being but it was an imperfect competitor so last year we tried to perfect that 1992 legislation by giving the satellites the right to carry the local network programming in the package in short to give americans a real choice why because we had taken away the authority to regulate the monopoly well guess what in march of last year all the authority to regulate from washington monopoly cable ended we allowed that to happen but across america outside of the 70 major markets that will be served by this new legislation last year americans will either have no multichannel delivery or will be afflicted with a single channel delivery system that is now unregulated we created through this process of legislation the possibility that many americans will have only one choice for television programming today wc cure that today we make sure that here in washington we provide the loar guarantees not the loans we are not giving anybody a billion dollars we are providing governmentbacked guarantees to make sure that the rest of america in addition to the 70 major markets the rest of america will have more than one choice now that is the way we ought to behave if we are going to take away power to regulate monopolies we ought to always ensure that consumers have real choice because then consumers can regulate the companies by choosing which they want to reward with their money and which they want to punish by taking their business away with two providers in the marketplace americans will finally be protected they will have choice and with choice will come fair prices with choice will come fair packaging of products with choice will come consumer regulation of the marketplace i hope we pass this good bill"], [1.9848346710205078e-05,

great deal of confusion some of it has of course been in my state even in my locale in central florida i have just returned from observing some of the process in the florida house of representatives i served on the ethics and elections committee and helped write some of the laws that we now work under and some have been changed since i left there and came to congress some years ago but basically under the laws of this state of florida and under the laws and the constitution of the united states there is one date set aside for the election of the president of the united states just look at article 2 of the constitution and it is there the method for electing the president we all cast our ballots on that date in florida there was a vote taken and the results of that vote are public record and it is all submitted through the supervisor of elections to the state secretary of state in a close election florida law provides that where there is onehalf of 1 percent difference that there is an automatic recount neither side has to ask for a recount a recount is ordered so in florida we had under the constitution and state laws a legal valid election in which governor bush led we had a recount the secretary of state gave them until thursday at 5 last thursday at 5 each county the right and obligation to submit a recount and each one was to conduct that and i believe the secretary of state even gave some extra time in my county we stayed up until 4 in the morning and we were the last seminole county to report all 67 counties in a recount reported under the laws of the state of florida in proper order now we have gotten into recounts of the general election recounts of the recount and we are into this sort of fuzzy area the law and it has changed since i was in the legislature allows for manual counts but unfortunately there are no guidelines for this so what i saw over the weekend in these manual counts even in volusia county is sort of disorganized i do not want to say chaos but it is sort of recounting the second time by the seat of your pants and it is somewhat subjective that is what we do not want in this case we have two valid counts and that is what we need to take the gentleman from georgia pointed out that in palm beach county there were some 16 000 invalid ballots we have also documented throughout the state almost in every county we had invalid counts hi11869 so we have two counts tomorrow the secretary of state katherine harris has very appropriately said she is going to abide by the law of the state of florida that is by 5 they will certify a count the three members of our state canvassing board the secretary of state now the commissioner of agriculture since the governor recused himself and one other elections official will serve as the canvassing board and at 5 those will be the votes that are counted courts can extend this they may very well do this but the ultimate decision is up to those three individuals who will be the state certifiers finally let me just make one other point the only other ballots that will be counted when all this is said and done according also to law and we must adhere to law are the overseas ballots which must be in by friday at close of business all the rest of this dragging people in from chicago reverend jackson from wherever he comes from and all these other folks is just in

for 90 percent of our nations energy reserves at current rates of consumption the united states has enough coal to last throughout the next 2 centuries and that is just here in the united states coal generates nearly 40 percent of all electricity worldwide a number that is growing as we stand here and debate this issue here are the facts we have an abundant supply of coal it is responsible for
