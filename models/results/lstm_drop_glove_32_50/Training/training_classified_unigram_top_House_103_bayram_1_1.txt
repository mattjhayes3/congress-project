away from the return of constitutional government in haiti in accordance with an agreement that was signed on governors island with the united states and the united nations and the illegal representatives of the illegal government of haiti plus the legal government of haiti the return of president aristide the lawfully elected president of haiti elected by 70 percent of the voters will take place on october 30 just 23 days away the timetable was moving forward whether or not we complete all of the steps in the sequence and arrive at the final solution on october 30 will depend on the resolve of the president of united states all parties to the agreement except one are cooperating and fulfilling and enforcing the agreement the one party to the agreement that is not fully living up to the agreement is the illegal government that was installed as a result of the coup detat against president aristide 2 years ago although they did go to governors island and they did agree that they would relinquish power by october 30 there are elements among the military the army and the police who are in haiti and the police are just a unit of the army there are elements there who are insisting that they will not abide by the agreement they are terrorizing the population and they have murdered some people within the last monthandahalf we are about to witness a major achievement which will set a precedent for the new world order if we pursue this agreement to its logical conclusion but the handful of thugs the handful of people who have the guns you know in haiti the army is 7 000 men only against a nation of 7 million and 70 percent of those 70 million people voted for a president and it is 70 percent of the population against the rest of the population but the army has the gunt the handful of people who are terrorizing the population they have the guns and without threatening war without intervention without a united nations special peacekeeping force carefully and diligently diplomats have worked out a situation whereby the army promised to back down the army promised by october 30 that it would cooperate with the restoration of constitutional government elements of the army now threaten to torpedo that agreement and the only voice that they will listen to at this point is the voice of president clinton whether or not this agreement succeeds or not whether or not this process succeeds or not is now very much in the hands of the president they only understand the language of firmness the language of commitment we do not have to threaten to send necessary troops we just have to repeatedly let them know that this government will not tolerate a torpedoing or a sabotaging of this agreement so we are urging the president at this point to take whatever actions are necessary to impress upon the handful of army commanders who are still leading a violent group against the population to impress upon them the fact that the united states is very serious about guaranteeing that this agreement is enforced about 10 days ago a codel of representatives of the house went to haiti under the leadership of congressman rangel i was a member of the codel and we went there because we were requested by president aristide and the leaders of the haitian legal government the constitutional government to show a presence as soon as possible they had undergone a monthandahalf of escalation of violence 100some people has been killed and people maimed and beaten and finally a close friend and supporter of president artistide had been dragged out of a church and murdered so they asked us to go right away in the hope that we would express by our presence the fact that the united states was still firmly committed to this agreement i think our trip was successful i think it was successful in that we went and we made a firm statement about the need to stop the violence and stop the killing president clinton gave us a letter to give to prime minister malval prime minister malval was recently installed by president aristide as one of the steps toward restoring constitutional government the letter from president clinton to prime minister malval said quite clearly that the united states was still firmly committed to the enforcement of the agreement and that it would hold the coup leaders responsible for any further violence our presence there i think had some effect for some short period of time the killings stopped for about a week the violence stopped for about a week but now the violence has resumed again in the last few days the killings and threats have begun again it is necessary for the president to send a strong message again that we intend to support this agreement all the way to october 30 i think it would be a major achievement not only by the clinton administration but by the organization of american states a major achievement by the united nations a major achievement in this new world order it will be an unprecedented situation where the legally elected president or leader of a republic in this hemisphere was returned to power as a result of pressure brought by the international community and the united states that has never happened before it has never happened before the coup leaders the military juntas across the western hemisphere and across the world have had their way now in this new world order committed to democracy committed to human rights the international community of the united nations and the community of nations within this hemisphere under the organization of american states have made it clear that we stand firmly behind constitutional governments and against military juntas who are in power as a result of illegal coups detat this agreement that is moving forward and will culminate in the return of president aristide by october 30 is the result of actions by president clinton which were very vital the situation was turned around a few months ago when president clinton decided that he would issue an order to freeze the assets of all the coup leaders and people who supported the coup all the assets that they had in this country would be frozen the president decided to deny visas to those people who supported the coup and the president decided to go to the united nations and request effective sanctions from the international community this is after more than a year and a half of making statementstrue under president bush we made statements that we supported the democratically elected government of haiti we supported president aristide we made statements like that we refuse to recognize the military junta under president bush but we never took any steps beyond that it was president clinton who turned the situation around by freezing the assets denying visas and going to the united nations and calling for strong action by the entire international community yes there had been some efforts to impose sanctions by the organization of american states but that had fallen flat nobody was serious about that other nations outside of the western hemisphere did not abide by it so the coup leaders had no threat to the economy no threat to the loss of vital materials such as oil until the president turned the situation around by calling for united nations strong sanctions which were instituted less than 2 months after the institution of the strong actions by the united nations the coup leaders came to the governors island to negotiate they were willing to negotiate because the country was running out of oil the most vital ingredient and there were other serious hardships resulting from an embargo imposed by the international community the coup leaders came to goiernors island and they agreed to a process which called for the restoration of democracy in haiti by october 30 as i said before this agreement sets a major precedent we did not restore constitutional government by sending in a major invasion force we did not restore constitutional government by taking sides in a civil war it was all negotiated it would be almost a miracle if on october 30 this process does achieve the restoration of democracy with the return of president aristide i congratulate president clinton i congratulate him on being willing to take the critical steps to turn the situation around of stepping out to initiate a foreign policy which is a foreign policy very much in the interest of the american people it is in the interest of american people to have democracy in this hemisphere everywhere freemarket democracies are very much in the interests of the american people they have a direct bearing on what we do on our economy on our trade there are numerous ways where the existence of freemarket democracies are directly related to the prosperity and welfare of the people of this country freemarket democracies that are pchieved without war without an investment in military operations which might result in the loss of lives is also far more desirable than other ways to achieve democracy through more difficult means so it is a major precedent it has a direct bearing on the lives of the people of this country many people have tried to wed the haitian situation to the somali situation somalia was a case where we went in to bring humanitarian relief to individual human beings somalia is a case unprecedented probably in this century where there was a complete breakdown of law and order within a society not a civil war you did not have one ethnic group fighting another or one factionone religion fighting another somalia was a situation where people all speak the same language they are all the same race they are not broken up into different ethnic groups within that race they are all the same religion yet they broke up into various factions fighting for the most selfish of reasons and the government just disintegrated we did not go in to do anything except to bring relief to individuals who were just starving to death because of this chaos and because food supplies were being captured by armed gangs and could not reach people even humanitarian aid sent from around the world somalia at this point with twothirds of the country secured twothirds of the country on its way to recovery there is no starvation in twothirds of the country crops are growing again farmers are working their fields again law and order has been restored to somalia but yet you have remaining a hot spot one situation in mogadishu which has exploded and resulted in the loss of lives not only of american boys but also numerous other u n soldiers and of course many innocent civilians somalians it ts a most unfortunate situation it is mostly successful but the remaining situation leads many americans to conclude that we should never go outside of our borders to try to help anybody that it is not in our interest we have nothing to gain from somalia somalia does not have any oil does not have any uranium is not strategically located there is no more cold war so we do not care whether it falls into the hands of the soviet union or some other bloc it is strictly a humanitarian gesture for the most noble of reasons we have gone into somalia it is most unfortunate that one tiny faction with guns one hardheaded selfish brutal maddog faction has caused all this trouble we should not equate that with haiti however haiti is a totally different situation haiti is not broken up into factions haiti is a situation where 70 percent of the people on election day an election supervised by international observers 70 percent agreed they wanted one man for president that man was in the office of president for 7 months during the 7 months that president aristide was in office most of the haitian people who had been trying to get out of haiti to come to the united states by any means necessary using boats rickety ships so desperately that they would take any kind of risk they stopped it stopped 0 1830o for 7 months there were almost no haitians attempting to enter the united states they had hope not only had they voted for this man 70 percent they believed in him they did not have any foreign aid program overnight they did not have any discovery of oil overnight they were not suddenly wealthy overnight nothing happened except they felt they had a government that believed in trying to do what it could to help all the people in haiti this is after decades of oppression decades of oppression under duvaliers papa doc duvalier baby dec duvalier who along with an elite group of people in haiti an elite group of people in the united states who owned some businesses there and helped to run the country from here they ran the country of haiti a country of 6 million people they ran the country as if it was a giant plantation the elite lived very well but the great majority of the people lived in the most degrading kinds of conditions and turned haiti into the poorest country in this hemisphere one of the poorest countries in the world all that happened before aristide was elected once he was elected and the people saw they had hope they stopped trying to enter the united states illegally we did not have a problem of large numbers of illegal haitian refugees we did not have a problem which made us behave in an inhumane way by denying people the right to enter the country in order to seek asylum many of the problems as a result of the desperate attempt of people to get out of haiti did not exist and they will not exist again if president aristide is returned if president aristide is returned and a stable government restored the democracy which the haitian people have fought for begins to blossom you will have yhe creation of a new market instead of the haitian populace becoming a burden on the united states or the western hemisphere you will have the flowering of a new economy in haiti which will create a new market and new kinds of relationships with all their governments within this hemisphere and the economies in this hemisphere we would be on the side of promoting human rights we would be on the side of promoting democracy we would be on the side of promoting prosperity for the haitians a people who have fought hard and long for this democracy the haitian people are to be congratulated i first should congratulate president clinton he was a key force that turned this situation around we certainly should congratulate president aristide president aristide has maintained from the very beginning that he would not countenance violence that he would insist on a peaceful solution to the problem with 6 or 7 million people in haiti against an army of 7 000 even if they did not have guns and you started a guerrilla warfare you probably ultimately after the deaths of thousands of people would be able to overwhelm the military thugs and take back the country president aristide insisted that he did not want sacrifices in that kind of guerrilla warfare he is to be congratulated for having faith in the united nationsand in the united states and going to governors island to sign an agreement which had very unusual elements in it the agreement signed at governors island pro vides that the people who staged the coup would be in charge right up until the very end of the process for restoring the constitutional government right up to the end general cdras and police chief michel francois right up to the very end they would be in charge of the army of maintaining law and order right up until the very end they would be expected to make certain that the transition takes place in the governors island agreement president aristide was called upon to appoint a prime minister but the prime minister could not walk into his office without having the army or the police escort him there safely the prime minister could not appoint a cabinet without the members of that cabinet having the army or the police to protect their offices and allow them to go in and take control of their departments all of this was in the hands of the very people who staged the coup in the first place it took a lot of faith to believe that such a plan would work at the very end of the plan by the tinie president aristide returned basically the country is still in the hands of the army and the police the u n observers will be there by october 30 but there are only going to be 1 500 u n observers unarmed observers observers who have no mandate to interfere in any way in the implementation of justice in the country along with trained police from canada from france that are supposed to train the army and the police and convert the coup leaders the terrorists into a civilian force and a peaceful army that will continue with the same people basically it takes a lot of faith to sign an agreement like that that is the agreement that president aristide signed it is up to the united states and the united nations to enforce that agreement now i congratulate president aristide for having that kind of faith he has done everything he was supposed to do to live up to this agreement now i congratulate the haitian people the haitian peopleare to be congratulated above all they have exhibited a great hunger and thirst for democracy from the very beginning the haitian people without a single set of guns or tanks or armored cars rose up to express their discontent with dictator duvalier and after days and days of peaceful demonstrations they forced duvalier to leave haiti and that set off a chain reaction that led to the establishment of a new constitution nobody believed they would ever write a constitution all kinds of efforts were put forth to prevent them from developing a constitution they wrote the constitution they had an election to approve the constitution the constitution was approved they held elections they held their first elections at their first elections the army came in and shot people down at the polls nevertheless they resolved to hold another election they held another election and the army rigged the election by forcing every voter to hand their ballots to a soldier first before it was cast finally they had an election that was supervised by the international community and that is the election that elected president aristide it has taken many many years to reach this point finally they elected president aristide after 7 months he was overthrown and now within 23 days president aristide will be returning to haiti that is 23 days away from a major human rights victory 23 days away from a major victory for democracy 23 days away from a major return to constitutional government which has set a new precedent for this new world order the members of the codel that went to visit haiti less than 10 days ago have called upon president clinton to meet with us to discuss the situation for the next 23 days in the last few days it has deteriorated and people have been killed there are threats we worry about a mad dog faction staging a massacre at the last minute we call upon president clinton to do whatever is necessary to see to it that is prevented the congressional black caucus also calls upon president clinton to appoint a white house coordinator for the haitian initiatives beyond october 30 humanitarian aid will have to be offered the police training process goes forward road building economic development a number of things are going to happen to rebuild the country of haiti under president aristide we call upon the president to appoint a white house coordinator for haitian initiatives that person would expedite the flow of decisionmaking which would facilitate the reconstruction of haiti we call upon the president to also expedite the appointment of a new ambassador to haiti we understand a candidate has been nominated william luceyswing his nomination is pending before the senate we would like to see the new ambassador to haiti installed in haiti before october 30 that again sends a signal to the thugs it sends a signal to the opposition to the accord the agreement we would like to other nations like france have their ambassadors in place in haiti before october 30 e3 1840 there are a number of other steps that the congressional black caucus has voted to take in support of the restoration of democracy in haiti but i would like to conclude with my appeal to the american people to understand that here is a victory for nonviolence here is a victory for a peaceful process whereby we have restored constitutional government here is an opportunity to make certain that this nation will never again have to face a situation where illegal military forces take over we call upon the american people to establish a peopletopeople relationship with haiti there are churches in haiti which need aid there are hospitals in haiti which need aid there are organizations in this country nonprofit organizations that know very well how nonprofit organizations have to operate in order to exist schools need help we would like for churches here to adopt churches there schools here to adopt schools there hospitals here to adopt hospitals there haiti has been isolated although it is only 500 miles away from the shores of the united states it has been basically isolated from the benefits of american democracy from the interchange that is necessary if we have an interchange person to person from here on then we will never have to worry about having to fight dictators in haiti again we will never have to worry about having to go through a long tortuous process of diplomacy to restore a constitutionally elected government we are 23 days away from victory 23 days away from what will set a new precedent in this new world order what we have done in haiti we should do again and again in this hemisphere to send a clear message that we are in support of democracy and we do not have to have guns and military intervention to enforce that democracy it ts 23 days away i salute thi people of haiti i salute president aristide and i salute president clinton for his very aggressive and forwardlooking foreign policy initiative with respect to haiti in 23 days we will have a major victory for all of us"], [0.24499350786209106, 0.7550064921379089, 1, "the crime bill is coming up and because of special

time to discuss this important issue the recent surge in sectarian violence in northern ireland serves to remind the international community that while northern ireland may not be a front page story the intractable conflict which has cost countless lives both catholic and protestant through violence despair and hunger strikes still rages on although efforts to bring peace to northern ireland have been launched many times during recent years the british government has used its power to block most meaningful efforts recently gerry adams president of sinn fein and john hume leader of the sdlp party who together represent the majority of catholic voters in northern ireland proposed a peace initiative which was designed to bring peace to the six counties of the north unfortunately the humeadams plan was quickly dismissed by the british government the british government continues to stick by its longheld view that the problems of northern ireland should be solved by bilateral negotiations between the british government and the government of the republic of ireland not only has this approach failed to achieve even a modicum of success the many times it is been tried before it is based on the unreasonable assumption that the problems of northern ireland can be solved without the input of the people who live in northern ireland playing a significant role to me the british approach to solving the northern ireland problem smacks of a colonial mindset they simply believe they know what is best for the people of northern ireland while the british government continues to believe they can lead northern ireland by any unbiased standard the more than 20year tenure of direct british rule in northern ireland which has transformed the six counties of the north into a virtual british colony has been a failure even if we discount the political and moral arguments against continued british rule it is clear that ending the status quo is an economic necessity it is clearly time for the british to go according to patrick mayhew britains secretary of state for northern ireland the province costs the british 3 billion pounds or 4 44 billion a year mayhew also acknowledges that england has no economic or strategic interests there mayhew has stated however that as long as the majority wishes to remain in the united kingdom the british government will continue to pay the steep annual costs without complaining while the british government may be willing to continue this spending without complaint the british public is not all public opinion polls in britain for more than 20 years have shown a majority of the british favor withdrawing troops from ireland the public also fails to share the british governments unwavering interest in controlling peace negotiations there around 80 percent favor peace talks that would bring all parties in the north and south to the table to negotiate peace in addition to financial support the british currently provide considerable military commitment to the six counties of the north 19 000 troops are currently stationed in northern ireland these soldiers are not peacekeepers but rather participants in a war that has lasted 25 years and cost more than 3 000 lives created in excess of 31 000 injuries and untold billions of dollars in property damage if the same proportion of the populations of england scotland and wales had been affected it would have left 100 000 dead and well over 1 million injured and maimed it is clear that every policy the british government has tried to exert its rule in northern ireland has failed this thesis is not just the view of the catholic minority but is supported by formidable independent authorities according to amnesty international the european commission and european court of human rights the united kingdom has the worst human rights record in europe what has become routine practice by the british the founders of our own system of jurisprudence in northern ireland may shock some americans in northern ireland the british practice internment without trial have eliminated the right to a jury trial and an accuseds right to silence and impose statesponsored censorship according to these respected human rights organizations british rule is also responsible for a series of unjustified killings by members of security forces police sponsored torture and the inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners the pattern of violence in the north of ireland has almost overwhelming repercussions in the republic of ireland there an already struggling economy must spend four times as much per capita as the united kingdom on security costs related to northern ireland to contain the conflict to the north as a result of the toll this struggle has taken on the republics economy the principle export of the republic is its educated young people after a quarter century of conflict and economic disaster a substantial peace dividend would accrue to all involved parties if this war could be ended not only would military security and other related expenditures be available to help reconstruct irelands economy but a well educated work force would benefit from foreign investment in enterprises that would prosper in a peaceful climate the decision of how the whole of ireland should be governed is a question which should be decided not by foreign governments but by the people of ireland but to say this is not enough to realize this goal the people of the republic and northern ireland just like the south africans aild namibians and palestinians and israelis need help and encouragement from abroad the united nations the conference on security and cooperation in europe the european community the international monetary fund the world bank and most of all the united states must work to demonstrate to all the parties including the unionists in the north that a united ireland makes economic social and

encourage american firms to undertake joint ventures for the production of hightechnology goods and services if anything h r 1313 is a reality check for all of us who care about the competitive position of this country as we move into the 21st century lets be candid it is time that we acknowledge that america has not performed in peak condition at the high stakes game of international competition over the past few decades we ceded our market dominance to our trading partners in one vital industry after another in the 1960s we lost the lead in steelmaking and shipbuilding in the 1970s we slipped behind in consumer electronics in the 1980s we lost our edge in machine tools now in the marketplace of the 1990s and beyond the industrial winners will be those who excel at producing such products as high definition tv robotics and a host of other new technologies now on the horizon the economic winners will be those who recognize and adapt to the fact that hightechnology manufacturing has shifted to short product life cycles and that rapid response is the key to meeting consumer demands while a single firm might be daunted by these challenges h r 1313 encourages competitors to collaborate at the production stage thus speeding the commercialization of new technologies and products the antitrust laws recognize this and are in fact very accommodating to this kind of joint production effort unfortunately reality and perception do not always coincide a widely held misperception in the business community is that antitrust laws generally frown on all cooperativeactivity regardless of its procompetitive benefits after considering this issue carefully the committee on the judiciary concluded that such a misperception can in fact impact on business behavior and decisions it is therefore time to clear up confusion and release the innovative forces in our industrial sector that are second to none we dealt with a similar problem regarding joint ventures in the research and development field almost a decade ago by enacting the national cooperative research act of 1984 the ncra has been a pronounced success in encouraging r d joint ventures more than 300 have been registered since its passage h r 1313 builds on the success of the ncra by extending its principles to cover production joint ventures thus production joint ventures would be judged by the rule of reason standard under which the procompetitive bene fits of an activity are weighed against any anticompetitive effects with damage exposure reduced to actual damages rather than the usual treble damages in addition the bill requires that to receive the benefits of the act the principal facilities of the venture must be located in the united states this last feature should

post and some of the wire services also the miami herald which i read and i was told that the today show one of the morning network news programs mentioned amassacre that had taken place at a similar time frame to the massacre of july 13 and the massacre of those 12 people in haiti was as i said covered by the media that i have just referred to i say recently in the new york times and in other newspapers coverage of some deaths that occurred by accident in panama unfortunately i also saw coverage of the horrendous tragedy in much media both written and television and radio of the unacceptable and brutal tragedy that occurred in argentina i was told that again the morning news program on television the today show on nbc news had substantial coverage of that tragedy and other media but with regard to cuba i must say and i would assume that the american people who are watching on cspan would agree that you do not hear much about what happens in cuba it is as though massacres can occur and unarmed citizens can be shot down can be cut down with bullets and yet you do not hear about it in much of our national media for example not just the july 13 massacre but last summer a year ago our state department issued a statement denouncing and condemning the practice of the cuban dictatorship of throwing hand grenades and firing upon swimmers who try to reach the guantanamo base the unitedstates naval base in guantanamo in the eastern part of cuba and the fact that there were eyewitnesses to numerous instances of hand grenades having been thrown at swimmers and the swimmers lifeless bodies being subsequently picked up and put on the boats the cuban vessels government vessels with fishhooks yet i ask the american people watching on cspan where was the national and international coverage of that event could you imagine if thd haitian dictatorship would throw hand grenades at citizens trying to flee haiti and who were actually swimming and then would pick them up with fishhooks would we not be seeing that in the national media also last summer in two towns in cuba there were armed attacks by the thugs of the dictatorship upon the unarmed people of cuba that we found out about and yet i did not see and i ask who saw covered on our national media those attacks by the cuban dictatorship in recent months within the last 6 weeks two vessels full of refugees despite having been shot at by the thugs of the cuban dictatorship managed to arrive on the shores of florida i ask what coverage did those incidents receive and had those incidents been not from cuba but from again haiti or other dictatorships outside of this hemisphere would we not have heard about them that is the question that i ask tonight this spring more than 100 people burst into the belgium embassy in havana as i recall there were more than 30 children among them and again the lack of coverage of that incident and of the fact that in the german embassy and in the chilean consulate similar incidents occurred just weeks ago pask again why is it that those events are not given the proper coverage if they were simply isolated events if they were insignificant events i would perhaps try to understand why there is no coverage i do not think it would be acceptable but i think i would try to understand why there is no coverage if the events were from 10 000 miles away it would be unacceptable not to cover them yet perhaps one could say well they are 10 000 miles away they are so far from our shores there might be a rationale to not covering the tragedies such as the ones i have mentioned it would be unacceptable not to cover them if they were 10 000 miles away but they are not 10 000 miles away they are 90 miles from the shores of the united states of america if they were isolated in that they occurred just in these instances that 1 mentioned and never before nor after well perhaps it could be said that they were so isolated that that is why they did not receive coverage it would be unacceptable not to cover those incidents even if they were extraordinarily isolated but that could be perhaps some sort of rationale but those incidents are typical ones that commonly occur i remember on this floor seeing a young boy speaking to a young boy who was here as a guest of my colleague the gentlewoman from florida and the boy was 10 years old and told me that he had come in a little boat from cuba and for hours in the night while the boat was seeking to reach the shores of freedom a helicopter of the cuban armed forces was looking out for the boat to sink it this little boy would tell me with large bags full of sand that this helicopter would throw at the boat in order to sink it the little boy said that since it was nighttime they did not see us they did not sink us they saw our wake i remember he told me but they did not see us and we managed to make it so it happens all the time the genocidal conduct of this brutal dictatorship just 90 miles from our shores occurs all the time and the lack of coverage of that genocidal conduct by our national press and media occurs all the time and yet it seems as though the only time that cuba is mentioned by much of our national media is to say tv marti is jammed i am sure many of the folks listening watching tonight on cspan have seen those reports i have read editorials in many newspapers and have seen many e 1581 stories in the networks on the fact that castro jams television marti and thus editorializing much of that media and newspapers say we should get rid of that effort to inform with news and information to send news and information to the cuban people because castro seems to be able to jam much of the time television marti that i have seen covered oh yes we hear about television marti in editorialized versions of the story we hear that tv marti should not continue because castro seems to jam tv marti instead of if we are going to hear editorializing on that story tv marti seems to be jammed so we have even more of a reason to make it better and to get through the jamming tv arti seems to be jammed often so we have an obligation to listen to the report of thatindependent panel that this congress set up just 1 year ago in a totally unbiased and detached manner which went through in a detailed fashion studied this issue studied what radio and tv marti do and came out with a report saying that not only should they be continued but to improve the technological ability and we can improve within the existing budget the technological ability of television marti to get through castros jamming and to reach the cuban people because a substantial amount of the population of cuba is extremely desirous to receive television marti like over 70 or even 83 percent of the cuban people listen on a daily basis to radio marti but that is not the editorializing that we hear about in the coverage on tv btarti inevitably the editorializing on television marti is because a foreign dictator seems to be jamming our broadcasts of television blarti that thus we should end those broadcasts lmagine during the cold war when the russians sought to jam radio free europe and soutght to jam radio liberty if the media if much of the media in a systematic fashion would tell the american people we should end our broadcasts because the russians seem to be jamming or want to jam our broadcasts that is not what would have been proper as it is not proper now to try to editorialize with regard to that program which is so important for the our mission of getting news and information to the people of cuba and for facilitating a transition to democracy in cuba and there are other things that we read about cuba because cuba is reported for example efforts to try to incite and encourage illegal tourism to cuba by the american people there is a ban on tourist travel to cuba as there is a ban on tourist travel to libya and there is a ban on tourist travel to iraq and there is ban on tourist travel to north korea those are terrorist states and for a very good reason we have established a policy that we do not want to see our tourists and our tourists dollars go to help those terrorist regimes but it is not uncommon to see for example look at this i read this in the washington post july 20 i week after the massacre by the way of july 13 this article on food food in cuba entitled cuba a slow reawakening when i first saw this i thought good there is coverage now i saw a story on cuba a week after the massacre and i thought it has taken them a week but finally they will have a story on the massacre finally i see no a slow reawakening of tastes if you ever want to see a let them eat cake story the ultimate let them eat cake story look at this food section in the washington local newspaper washington post of the 20th of july this writer who wrote this story on the food in cuba states the crumbling edges of pastel buildings were softened by the night i felt like saa brown in guys and dolls down for a lark with sky masterson and then this writer goes on talking about the food that only the tourists and the communist hierarchy can go and have by the way describing these wonderful restaurants in havana but in old havana there are hopes that things will get better as tourists are attracted to the city as they were in the past the government is betting its money on it listen to this the amount or fat in the cuban diet has been reduced in recent years and there is greater emphasis on fruits and vegetables by necessity as well as by choice the floridita restaurant a few blocks away was a favorite hemingway hangout while you sip strolling musicians serenade with songs from the 1950s and before the floriditas grilled tarragon chicken with french fries was delicious the lobster bisque was fine this writer continues to go on describing the food in the restaurants of havana there was something about errol flynn and ava gardner in the restaurant i mopped up every drop of the juice of my meat this writer continues later in the wellappointed grill room of the hotel sevilla i sipped a cuba libre and snacked on fried plantains the student waiter served my camarones al jillo soft music played now in here in this wonderful review of havana restaurants there is absolutely no mention of the fact that the cuba people cannot enter these restaurants that only tourists and ommunist hierarchy with dollars can enter these restaurants the ultimate example of lack of sensitivity as i called it before the ultimate let them eat cake example of journalism about a country that due to the destructidn brought upon it by a regime that does not permit its people to enter those restaurants that imposes a tourism apartheid wants to attract american tourism and articles like this articles like this are seeking simply to evade to encourage american citizens to break our law and to go to these restaurants that the cuban people are

in my 14 years as a member of the house committee on agriculture that i have come to the floor and had a disagreement with the leadership of my committee and i say that because i think it is important to understand what the problem is today the problem very frankly is that this administration to their credit allocated 1 1 billion over the next 5 years to make crop insurance an available program and the problem is that the subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies spent the money elsewhere and so we are in a dilemma here this morning of what are we going to do we have a couple of choices the first premise is that we are going to pasd crop insurance in lieu of disaster insurance now there are 18 states including wisconsin that have less than 10 percent of our eligible acreage in crop insurance and yet we are not going to make that the basic of all commodity security in this country that would be find if we had the public private partnership that our colleague from north dakota said that crop insurance is but the problem is it is not a public private partnership anymore that money through no fault of the chairman of the committee on agriculture the gentleman from texas through no fault of the gentleman from kansas through no fault of anybody on the house committee on agriculture was spent elsewhere so now we have this dilemma in front of us and it is very simple it all boils down to moneywho is going to pay and how much now i am not going to stand here and justify the appropriations committees act of underfunding the current federal crop insurance program by 213 million in the upcoming fiscal year plain and simple that action was wrong and it is the root cause of the fiscal problems we are addressing right now as we try to pass crop insurance reform legislation at the same time that battle is over and we lost so adopting the budgetary assumption that this lack of funding continues over the next 5 fiscal years the current issue is where are we going to make up the difference rest assured we have to cut the baseline somewhere and if we do not make those cuts in the crop insurance program itself we will have to find the money elsewhereresearch extension fmha wic commodity programs or the like the chairman of our committee is quite correct when he talks about the 60 billion of cuts which the agriculture committee has made in recent years indeed if every other committee was as frugal as we have been the budget mess facing this congress would have been solved in large part i agree with him that it is fundamentally unfair to balance the federal budget on the backs of the american farmer actually that is exactly what the pennygunderson amendment see to prevent all we are saying is that fair is fair whether we are trying to balance the entire federal budget or just a single program on the backs of farmers the bottom line of the pennygunderson amendment is that if we have a shortfall in crop insurance funds we need to make up that difference within that program heres why in my own congressional district only 10 percent of eligible acres are enrolled in crop insurance thats because either the federal crop insurance corporation doesnt have a policy for the crops they grow or the rate structure doesnt justify participation why should the rest of my producers have to take cuts in their commodity loan or conservation programs in order to fund higher policy subsidies for the small percentage of farmers which participate in the program or to fund higher reimbursement rates far the participants agents this situation is not unique to the state of wisconsin according to the most recent statistics available from the federal crop insurance corporation arizona california connecticut delaware kentucky maine maryland massachusetts michigan nevada new hampshire new jersey new york pennsylvania rhode island tennessee and vermont all have 10 percent or less of insurable acres actually enrolled in federal crop insurance why should those producers have to take cuts in their commodity loan or conservation programs to fund the participation of producers in other states the answer is simplethey shouldnt all the pennygunderson amendment does is find sufficient cuts within the federal crop insurance program itself to meet the budget parameters within which that program has to operate over the next 5 fiscal years with four exceptions it is identical to the chairmans amendment which will be offered as a substitute here are the differences first it reduces the agent reimbursement to 30 percent for new policies and 28 percent for renewals immediately rather than waiting 2 years to make that reduction second it charges a 50 fee for all policies issued whether a farmer sticks with the basic policy or buys supplementary coverage third it reduces the catastrophic coverage provided by the basic policy from 50 60 to 50 56 and fourth it requires a filing fee for producers to make a disaster claim for crops for which no policy is offered these changes are hardly draconian if were reducing the agent reimbursement rate in the out years why not immediately the proposed 282930 percent reimbursement rate for crop insurance far exceeds the 101112 percent reimbursement rate on automobile insurance now i recognize that thee is a volume difference between the two however dropping the reimbursement rate 2 percent 2 years early is not going to drive anyone out of business particularly if we can get some paperwork reduction to those agents similarly the reduction in catastrophic coverage from 50 60 to 50 56 will result in a maximum reduction of 2 percent in the maximum loss payment received by any farmer under the basic policy again every little bit hurts but it is a small price in terms of the big picture the ultimate question is if we are unwilling to make the cuts necessary in the program itself are we better off with permanent disaster assistance authority in lieu of any crop insurance program the simple facts are that even with a federal crop insurance program we have had to make billions of dollars of crop ask the private sector to engage in spent and puts it into a crop insurance emergency assistance available in each that kind of insurance and get us out program that will work for every farmof the

nations are hungry for change totalitarian ideology is on the run around the globe while we see and read about the terrible genocide in the balkans we must recognize that the nature of news is essentially negative and remind ourselves democracy and a new respect for human rights are germinating and growing in south and central america the former soviet union and asia we stand on the threshold of a new world that no one envisioned 10 years ago as the sole remaining superpower the united states cannot abdicate its responsibility to lead one benefit of the changed global situation is enhanced unitedstates security we are safer now than we have been in over 40 years as a consequence we are able to reduce our military expenditures substantially without the economic military and development assistance in this bill our ability to broject unitedstates influence overseas would be limited to military options and the defense budget would not be able to be reduced as substantially as is planned the best example of this trade off is the 2 5 billion in assistance included for the states of the former soviet union this small investment in securing the fragile democracy there may ultimately save us tens or hundreds of billions of dollars if we can help ensure that totalitarianism and a new militarism does not return to russia this may be a difficult political vote for some members i urge those members to keep in mind that this bill is not a giveaway it is in our best national interest to provide this funding that our own national interestis the bedrock of any nations foreign policy and the basis of all our foreign assistance programs i would like to mention several items in the bill that i believe are of special importance the subcommittee has provided ample funds in the esf and fmv accounts to fully meet our camp david commitments to israel and egypt and has made it very clear in this bill that it expects the administration to disperse these funds as it has in the past israel is the united states most important ally in the middle east more importantly it is a haven for refugees from the former soviet union and ethiopia where they have been persecuted both officially and unofficially for hundreds of years the funding that the united states provides to israel helps it maintain its qualitative military edge in a region where all but one of its neighbors refuse to recognize its right to exist it also assists the israelis in assimilating the huge number of new arrivals and provide decent housing and economic opportunity for them i am very pleased that the foreign operations subcommittee has included these funds and that the foreign affairs committee showed clear support for israel by earmarking them this bill also makes a strong statement about the importance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral voluntary family planning programs h r 2295 contains 392 million for the aid population program and 50 million for the united nations population fund rapid population growth is one of the most pressing problems facing the world poverty environmental degradation malnutrition and infant and child mortality caused by improperly spaced births are all direct results of the lack of adequate global access to voluntary family planning services in addition as prof paul kennedy clearly lays out in his latest book rapid population growth that is not accompanied by economic growth is a politically destabilizing force the highest growth rates in the world today are in the arab states of the middle east world population is presently increasing by 1 billion people every 11 years the human misery and irreversible environmental problems caused by population growth will only increase without action this bill addresses this urgent need and makes substantial increases in funding for population programs the bill also forcefully addresses the pressing problem of global environmental degradation with a central focus on promoting sustainable development as the report to accompany the bill makes clear economic growth must be predicated on sustainable use of resources rather than their exploitation funding is provided for an appropriately structured global environmental facility which is designed to assist developing countries pursue projects with global environmental benefits focusing on four areas first global warming second biological diversity third pollution of international waters and fourth stratospheric ozone depletion in addition funding for the aid blodiversity program and the global warming initiative are

amendments for the past several years the demand for loan guarantees under this program has increased annually in the magnitude of 35 to 40 percent per year largely coinciding with the credit crunch which is affecting the small business community in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 supplemental appropriations were needed to continue the program members will recall that the program actually closed for 10 weeks this year until such a supplemental could be enacted this reliance upon supplemental appropriations and the turning on and off of the small business loan faucet is not a good way to administer this program or any program a better solution must be found under existing law the maximum sba exposure on a 7 a loan guarantee is 750 000 per borrower sba and the lender share in any loan loss in a ratio depending upon the percentage of the loan guaranteed on small loans those under 155 000 the maximum guarantee is 90 percent on larger loans the maximum guarantee is 85 percent but either size loan if made under the preferred lenders program under which sba authorizes the lender to approve the loan oh sbas behalf and without prior sba review receives a maximum guarantee of 80 percent under the credit reform act of 1990 congress must appropriate in advance amounts calculated to pay the ultimate cost of any losses due to the loan guarantees this calculation is termed the subsidy rate and i annually adjusted by the lending agency subject to approval by the office of management and budget unless program changes are made the subsidy rate will be 4 7 percent for 1994 it appears that congress will appropriate approximately the amount requested by the administration for this program 155 million and that will support loan guarantees of 3 3 billion but we have received estimates of demand in excess of 7 billion an amount slightly above this years appropriated level of 6 8 billion thb presidents budget request proposes program changes which would reduce the subsidy rate to 2 13 percent this would provide 7 3 billion in loan guarantees the presidents proposal would reduce the subsidy primarily by reducing the guarantee on all loans for example the administrations proposal includes reducing the guarantee on small real estate loans to 70 percent instead of the current level of 90 percent i believe some changes can be made but in ways which will less adversely impact on small business borrowers let me note for the record that i do not advocate any of the proposed changes including my own proposal except insofar as they are necessary to enlarge the program size nor do i think the president advocates them except for this same reason but i do not believe we can secure a substantial increase in the appropriation and we must somehow stretch our budget and reduce the federal deficit i believe we can make savings of the magnitude the administration proposes but in a slightly different manner this bill would do so in four ways first the government and the lender would share large premiums on secondary market sales the small business administration would receive onehalf of all premiums above 110 on 7 a loan guarantees sold in the secondary market in other words if the lender sells the guaranteed portion of an sba loan to an investor the government would share equally with the lender in any amount of the sales price above 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan second the bill would authorize a reduction in the preferred lenderg guarantee this is a program under which certain experienced and proficient lenders receive authority to make guaranteed loans without sbas prior approval the guarantee on 7 a loans made under the preferred lenders program would be reduced to 70 percent whereas it is now 80 percent third the bill would authorize a reduction in the guarantee on large real estate loans the guarantee on real estate loans over 155 000 with terms over 10 years would be reduced to 75 percent whereas it is now 85 percent on amounts over that amount unless the loan is made through the preferred lenders program and fourth the bill would authorize the small business administration to impose a secondary market fee of twofifths of 1 percent annually on the outstanding principal amount of all 7 a loans sold in the secondary market this would be a new fee and would apply to future sales only these changes would provide a program level of 7 billion in loan guarantees i believe we must reduce the subsidy to make the 7 a loan guarantee program available to more small businesses i believe part of the solution lies in higher fees and part in lower guarantees but i believe these changes should be made selectively they should take into consideration those prospective borrowers least likely to be hurt and provide the most assistance to those who need it the most to me this means that the fees should be imposed on the loans sold in the secondary market to investors the fees should not be imposed on all banks simply because they participate in the 7 a program as they already pay in the form of guarantee fees imposed up front at the time the loan is approved moreover across the board fees are most likely to be charged to the borrower it is the large borrowers with good collateral that should be the ones receiving lower guarantee support lenders are still likely to fund these loans even with a lower guarantee as these collateralized loans are much less risky than are small nonrealestate loans finally let me point out that smaller loans are less apt to be sold in the secondary market than are larger ones thus my amendment is less likely to result in a fee being imposed on smaller loans i believe this bill represents the best combination of cost saving measures the committee however is concerned about the possible adverse impact of these changes upon small business borrowers particularly minority small businesses and womenowned small business we will monitor the impact very closely and have directed sba to do likewise and to report to congress annually with their findings and recommendations if we determine that there is a problem we will move to correct it i believe that this

speech or nonviolent picketing or you would never have the committee on the judiciary the aclu civil libertarians and everyone else backing it and i think we cannot say that enough what does this bill do it says you cannot block access to a clinic now why is that important well because since 1977 there have been 33 000 arrests for blockading clinics i have gone to our clinic in colorado when there have been people there blockading and ithas taken the police to get through the line so women could get inside for their health care when you read the editorials of the many newspapers who are talking about why this bill should be passed they went to the precedent that america has always had the federal government does not move in until it appears that in some parts of the country there is a breakdown that they cannot handle the numbers any more some places they handle it well but some places they just cannot deal any more and basically clinics are having to close because they cannot get that protection now as the gentlewoman from the district of columbia pointed out earlier that tradition is longstanding it is longstanding in the ku klux klan act unfortunately women in this country were told the ku klux klan act does not apply to them because they were not a protected class when it happened when it passed i hear what the gentlemen on the other side are saying i am sure bull connor said when he stood in front of the school door i am just standing here nonviolently yes but he was blocking access to the school door and it was a republican president mr eisenhower who said no that is not the american tradition and called out the national guard and made sure that he was moved to one side and children could have access there are many other federal laws that do not allow blockage of access under labor laws under section 158 b 1 a of the nlra it says during a strike that it is an unfair labor practice to block employees from exercising their right to access to the workplace there must be access or you can go into federal court and get an injunction i know this i use to work for the nlrb and that used to be my job so you can picket and do whatever you want but you cannot say no one can come into this workplace there are many other areas we have passed rules on animal rights violence we do not allow animal rights protestors to shut off a clinic that has animal laboratories going on they must allow access we have also got all sorts of laws that prohibit interference with voting you cannot go say i am just passively encircling this voting booth because we do not want those people to vote no that becomes a hostile act nor can you do it around a courthouse a federal courthouse nor can you do it to obstruct a foreign official from trying to conduct business nor can you do it on different federal grounds and places where different things are occurring so there is all sorts of federal laws i can put in those citations in the report i am not going to bore everyone what happened here is that in november both the house and senate passed this bill by substantial margins in the senate it was 69 to 30 in this house we voted 246 to 182 not to recommit the bill since november we have been thwarted from going to conference with the senate i have never seen it take this long to go to conference and i have never seen this have to stay around to get rules votes have all these procedural things we have had this argument over and over and over and over and over again and i find it really incredible that just to go to conference with the senate on this bill we are having to go through all these hurdles again are american womens rights that vulnerable apparently so because i do not think we would play around with other bills and other rights and at some point people say the majority have spoken the majority have spoken clearly and that we ought to proceed so tonight that is what i am trying to say the majority has spoken we ought to proceed we ought to get on to conference with the senate and we ought to be saying to american women yes they have the right to go to clinics for their health care the majority of women of childbearing age get their health care in these clinics that is where they go for all their health care when we did a survey or a survey was done by another group over 50 percent of the clinics have been harassed or surrounded or had acts of violence this has gone on and on and on i can read some of these horrendous acts of violence they have been very very very very serious so tonight i am not trying to delay this bill i am trying to move this bill and i certainly hope we can get on with it because i think americas women are getting very impatient with this and feel that it is time that their rights be given as much respect as everyone elses rights have been given as they have debated and debated and tied up and tried to do everything they could to thwart this bill that has had such

fiscal year 1994 enacted spending level somehow this 13 6 billion bill achieves that most difficult requirement the result is a responsible bill that is fair and evenly balanced it is one that we can be comfortable supporting certainly this bill is not perfect there are provisions in here that i disagree with i strongly oppose the 1year moratorium on mining patents included in the bill mining

does not reduce that program by 6 percent as the administration requested it still does not provide adequate funding for the timber sales program the administration requested funds to harvest 4 38 billion board feet that is almost 60 percent less than the program allowed in the early 1990s fiscal year 1994 funding represents a 16percent cut from the already low fiscal year 1993 level this bill

comprehensive crime bill to the floor the democratic leadership had an opportunity to schedule a debate and a vote preferably with an open rule to allow members to do something about violent crime about rape about crimes against women about drug dealing about all of the things that need to be dealt with in america today instead for reasons i do not fully understand the democratic leadership decided to bring out a series of tiny little bills trotting to the floor each without any money attached to it each designed to provide a press release one or two of them doing things that frankly are moderately useful they are not harmful but compared to the scale of the problem we face in america today todays efforts by the democratic leadership represent a disastrous failure of leadership it represents an abandonment of the victims of crime it represents a walking away from the problems of crime now i must say it is ironic that the democratic leadership decided to fail on the issue of crime the day after the country voted because the message from yesterday was clear who won in new york city the former prosecutor who promised to make new york safer who has a track record of putting criminals in jail what was the issue in virginia it was whether or not we would have a governor in george allen who is prepared to be tough on violent criminals what was the only thing which preserved florios governorship and made him in contention the fact that he had been very tough on crime what happened in washington state normally considered a fairly liberal state when a bill was brought up in washington state where they had the initiative and the voters can go past the professional politicians and the voters can demand a vote by 3 to 1 the people of the state of washington passed an initiative which said if you are a threetime violent criminal you are locked up for life we are not going to put you back on the street we are not going to trust you and we are going to protect innocent americans from violent criminals and that is in a state that is normally regarded as the bellwether of liberal states the day after citizens across the country said they were tired of violent crimes they were tired of drug dealers they were tired of being afraid we have this spectacle no comprehensive crime bill no effort to deal with an effective believable death penalty no effort to

would also like to say this is an observation of independence day in cuba i think it is very appropriate that floridas voice has always been loud and in the forefront when the subject of cuban independence has been raised but this is not a florida issue this is truly a national issue and it deserves the attention of every american i want to say congratulations and thank you not only to my colleague the gentlewoman from florida but my other colleagues as well the gentleman from florida who has spoken so eloquently and the gentleman from florida who has spoken so factually about what is going on the gentleman from new jersey who has talked about the human rights aspects and the gentleman from california who is unique in his own way in bringing his experience and passion to his statement that we have heard before and i am sure we will hear at this most appropriate time of independence it is critical that we keep this on the national radar scope i think that is what this effort is about tomorrow i know will be a day of celebration the 91st anniversary of the ascension to power of the first elected president of the new republic of cuba for most americans when we talk about independence day it is a time of celebration for the rewards that we gained from our own struggle for freedom for the right to speak our minds the right to make our own decisions the opportunity to build a safe and secure life for ourselves and our families and our children regardless of whatever political or religious beliefs we may hold regrettably as we are on the eve of cuban independence day the cuban people do not enjoy the rights and privileges that we associate with independence in this country things frankly that we take for granted for 34 years now under the tyranny of fidel castro and communism and his cronies the realization of these freedoms have been denied they have been denied to the cuban people they have been quashed by organized civilian goon squads plainclothes police and the brigadas accion rapidas that the gentleman from florida will tell us more about when we get in a colloquy about how the reaction in fidels cuba took place to persecute the surviving family members of indeed the lady that we tragically learned died today giving her life to save her son and escaping from fidels cuba these brigades go out and seek and crush any political dissent or any attempts to improve human rights in that country these are things that we will not tolerate for even an instant in this country and yet just a few miles off our shores they are going on and somehow our media are not picking up on it very simply put i think fidel castro has it exactly backwards instead of governing for the people he enforces his will at the expense of the cuban people instead of independence castro has given the cuban people a lose lose choice of socialism or death true independence is sadly still a dream that most cubans do not have cuba lives i think for a tomorrow that has yet to come lives there continue to be dominated by a repressive dictator and a political and economic system that almost everywhere else on the globe where it has been tried has failed it has gone the way of the dinosaur it has crashed into a black tar pit of oblivion never to be seen again it is called socialism and it does not work castro and cuba are isolated not because of policies of the united states government not because of things that we have done here but because castros cuba has chosen to identify itself with the criminals of the world the libyas the iraqs the people who are in business for themselves not for their people the economic philosophy in castros cuba truly has bankrupted the country and truly has jeopardized the future of the cuban people one thing is very clear and it may give us hope time is not on fidels side as the tide of democracy and capitalism continues to sweep over the western hemisphere we see castro is alone he is barely keeping his head above water the glare of international attention is shining on the human rights abuses and political repression other people know about it and they care cubas economy is in free fall in fact many believe castro would be gone now except for the fear he has been able to introduce into society maybe there is some naivete there in the younger generation maybe there is some residue of some ideological faith of those who do not understand but it is mostly fear that prevents cubans from imagining anything other than life under castro but just becausethis is todays cuba does not mean it has to be that way tomorrow in fact under the leadership of many who have spoken here tonight and again i congratulate particularly my colleagues who understand this so well personally and passionately being from cuba as the gentlewoman from florida and the gentleman from florida under their leadership we see the spirit of the cuban people and their struggle for freedom and we want to support and encourage that and i think perhaps the embodiment of that spirit is well shown in the tragic death of the mother who died today in her effort to escape with her son i am delighted to hear that her son lives and i hope when we do get into a colloquy that we can have a little talk on what the brigades have done the united states as their neighbors to the north obviously have got to do what we can to help the cuban people achieve their dream but we must not forget and i know the cuban people do not forget the change in cuba will ultimately depend on the cuban people themselves throughout cuba we know there are educated motivated patriotic individuals who see how the castro revolution has failed has betrayed the country and devastated its people so today it is our sincere hope that the combined efforts of the people of cuba will soon and i say very soon enjoy peaceful transition to the free democratic future that their grandparents envisioned 91 years ago i say happy

think the gentleman from alabama is correct in offering this amendment first foreign aid is simply not the answer to the complex problems of russia today anybody who has ever been to moscow knows that if and when russia solves its problems it will be the accomplishment of the russian people not the united states taxpayer bailing them out nowhere in thisbill does it say where our tax dollars for the former soviet union are going are the members not concerned about that so we can only assume it will be the same black hole as last year into programs like loans for stateowned industries run by the government those former communists still running those stateowned government agencies that are totally divorced from russias real problems second there is no economic reform in russia to support the reformers havelost nobody is more disappointed about that than i am but it is a fact russia is now run by those who have been aptly described as red economic managers in other words the same old former communists so lets stop pretending that there is still a comprehensive reform effort in russia there is not instead we need to heed the lessons of poland in the 1970s when the west dumped billions of dollars in that unreformed socialist economy all to no avail and it failed miserably third in the past year russian foreign policy has become increasingly aggressive russia halted troop pullouts from the baltics in november and injected new conditions into the negotiating process totally reneging on their word and the condition for the loan that we gave them last year then there is the forgotten country called moldova where russia maintains 7 000 heavily armed troops they not an entitlement program the were supposed to be out of there a year money is seed for a burnedout forest ago why are they not out in russia where there is nothing but russia has ensnared georgia eco ashes after 70 years of ruin and mayn0mically reabsorbed belarus and em hem yet all of a sudden we see

begun drawing together different segments of haitians societymembers of the haitian parliament the churches and the business sector to build what they call the the grand national consensus their aim is to balance the factions in haiti concentrating on the center rather than on the two extremes of the military junta and the aristide camp their efforts aie based on the assumption that if there is to be any lasting change in haiti no one faction can have it all their own way as lawrence pezzullo former special adviser on haiti wrote today in a column in the new york times the haitian constitution of 1987 which balances executive power with parliamentsessential in a country witha long history of abusive strongmentrequires that the president build a working majority in the legislature it was precisely father aristides estrangement from the elected parliament coupled with his chilly relationship with business leaders and the military that led to his overthrow in 1991

region is unfortunately strong so 1 believe that the actions taken by the president were correct and i am hopeful that der6ocracy will be returned to haiti soon yet some members here want to tie the presidents hands they want to micromanage the foreign and military policies of the nation while i do believe that it was the intention of theframers of the constitution to have the congress oversee military and foreign operations i do not believe that they would have wanted 535 secretaries of defense and 535 secretaries of state as i said earlier i believe that the dellumsmurthahastingsdicks amendment is a good balance allowing congress the oversight of the mission that it should perform while at the same time allowing the president and his military advisors the room to make the decisions that they feel are best for the mission and for the troops i further support the fact that the dellumsmurthahastingsdicks amendment calls for the prompt and orderly withdrawal of the united states forces from haiti as soon as possible since the possibility of an invasion of haiti was first discussed i have advocated a prompt withdrawal of united states troops to be replaced by multinational peacekeepers led by either the united nations or the o a s while i support the philosophy that the unit ed states should help people especially our neighbors pursue their basic rights as human beings i do not believe that this provides the united states a free license to impose our strength or our beliefs on other nations therefore i hope that the president will withdraw our troops quickly and that multinational perhaps even regional forces will be installed to help the country rebuild as i said earlier i support the dellumsmurthahastingsdicks substitute and i urge my colleaguesto do the same the substitute requires that the president report to the congress and that he stay in contact with us relative to the ongoing mission it further requires that the president answer many of the questions that some in the american public and indeed the congress feel have gone unanswered such as the scope of the mis sion the general rules of engagement for our forces and the approximate cost the american public has a right to know these answers and while i believe that the president has been as upfront as possible i hope that enactment of the dellumsmurthahastingsdicks substitute will help those who are not yet satisfied i support the president as i feel he has done an admirable job in a tough situation he has done the right thing i also support our troops as i believe that they are showing the world that the united states is ready and able to handle any assignment finally i support the substitute offered by my colleagues messrs dellums murtha hastings and dicks as i believe it is the best policy"], [0.0019276738166809082, 0.5019276738166809, 1, "madam chairman i rise today in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from massachusetts to kill the sp100 program the sp100 program is a ground research program that focuses on the development of components and technology that could be used for a future space demonstration of space power the program is being managed by the department of energy and cofunded by nasa and consists of the development of a small advanced space qualified reactor power system that can be utilized for many space applications including exploration of our solar system the current phase of the sp100 program was initiated in 1985 and is now within a yearandahalf of completing a system that will be capable of meeting several nearterm nasa mission objectives to date approximately 450 million have been spent for development of the sp100 program by the end of fiscal year 1994 fully tested hardware will be available madam chairman terminating this program prematurely would mean a very costineffective restart in the future in addition the program has made excellent technical progress under very difficult start stop funding and also has been designed with safety as its primary concern finally madam chairman although there are no current missions for the sp100 program there are a number of future civil and defense missions that will require this program the jet propulsion laboratory planners are evaluating an early mission using sp100 to map the particle and radiation fields of the van allen belts other agencies also are evaluating the sp100 for future deep space missions very simply we will need the nuclear power for these missions i would ask my colleagues not to throw away the 450 million investment that already has been made in this project the funding in this bill will allow the sp100 program to be documented and put on the shelf no one is asking for the 1 billion demonstration as is asserted by the authors of the amendment it is apparent in these tight budget times that we cannot afford this expense but we also cannot afford the expense and waste that would result if the sp100 program is terminated i strongly urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment"], [0.0019325017929077148, 0.5019325017929077, 1, "suggests that we just detube the submarines the president clearly stated
