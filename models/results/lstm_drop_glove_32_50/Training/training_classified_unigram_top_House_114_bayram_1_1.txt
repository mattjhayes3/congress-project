leaked trade deal terms prompt fears for pharmaceutical benefits scheme gabrielle chan the leak of new information on the transpacific partnership agreement tpp shows the megatrade deal could provide more ways for multinational corporations to influence australias control of its pharmaceutical regulations revealed via wikileaks the annexe on transparency and procedural fairness for pharmaceutical products and medical devices uncovered the draft agreements regarding medicines between the 12 tppa member countries the leak comes as us republican leaders announced a vote on friday that may provide barack obama a fasttrack authority to complete the agreement with australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam the countries represent 40 of the worlds economy the leaked text dated december 2014 laid out the draft rules for member countries regarding medicines under national health care programs in australias case the pharmaceutical benefits scheme pbs the tpp has yet to be signed off the abbott government has argued the trade deal will provide access for australian products to other markets but it requires australia to trade off regulations that stop access by other countries and particularly multinational companies to the australian market critics have suggested the deal which is likely to include investor state dispute settlement isds clauses will allow big corporations to sue australian governments philip morris international is currently challenging the former labor governments tobacco plain packaging laws under a hong kong trade treaty isds trade experts leaped on the rare information release regarding the secret but wideranging trade deal deborah gleeson a lecturer at the school of psychology and public health at la trobe university said the inclusion of an annexe on health serves no useful public interest purpose it sets a terrible precedent for using regional trade deals to tamper with other countries health systems and could circumscribe the options available to developing countries seeking to introduce pharmaceutical coverage programs in future gleeson said jane kelsey of the faculty of law of the university of auckland described the annexe as one of the most controversial parts of the tpp in her analysis she said the us pharmaceutical industry was using the trade agreement to target new zealands pharmaceutical management agency pharmac equivalent to the pbs this transparency annexe seeks to erode the processes and decisions of agencies that decide which medicines and medical devices to subsidise the public money and by how much kelsey said this leaked text shows the tpp will severely erode pharmacs ability to continue to deliver affordable medicines and medical devices as it has for the past two decades that will mean fewer medicines are subsidised or people will pay more as copayments or more of the health budget will go to pay for medicines instead of other activities or the health budget will have to expand beyond the cap whatever the outcome the big global pharmaceutical companies will win and the poorest and most vulnerable new zealanders will lose ama president brian owler said while doctors were very concerned at the possible effects on australias healthcare systems they were constantly dismissed by the trade minister andrew robb when we have raised concerns about the effects on health the only response is we are not going to undermine the pharmaceutical benefits scheme said owler we are worried about the investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism and there are issues in terms of patents that would affect pharmaceutical prices the problem is our concerns have been dismissed by the trade minister but we do not know what is in the text however robb said on thursday that the government would not accept anything that would adversely affect the pbs the health system more generally or increase the price of medicines for australians its perhaps time to look at the enormous benefits that will flow from a more seamless trade and investment environment across 12 countries representing 40 percent of global gdp robb said new levels of market access and common sets of trading rules will help support growth create new jobs and result in higher living standards parliamentarians were offered the chance to see the tpp draft by robb if they

happening behind closed doors without the scrutiny of the parliament he said at the very least the australian people deserve to be reassured that the government wont allow any deal which drives up the public health costs for australian taxpayers such as further subsidising important new medicines including biologics during the most recent senate estimates in the past fortnight whishwilson questioned officials from the department of foreign affairs and trade about the strategic importance of the tpp to the united states the secretary of dfat peter varghese said the whole purpose was to indicate a ramped up us presence in asia the conclusion of the tpp is important to the united states in terms of its rebalance because it is an important step in relation to the economic engagement of the united states with the region and the whole purpose of the rebalance was to indicate a ramped up us presence in asia and a recognition of the importance of asia in broader us geostrategic thinking

issue is strangling this economic recovery and incredibly we are going to take up a republican budget which cuts pell grants and also raises interest rate costs for stafford loan programs lets be very clear this budget allows the government to charge interest while people are in school which has been a pillar of the stafford student loan program that interest is not charged while kids are going

their kids to college have an opportunity with this legislation h r 1434 to allow them to refinance down their interest rates to a lower outofpocket cost that will provide an automatic instant

costs to folks whose pell grants wont rise and whose interest rates are going to go up on their stafford loans the choice is very clear with this vote that we are about to take one vote is going to

destroyed and over 100 other sites severely damaged thousands and thousands of coptic christians are estimated to have fled their homeland of egypt because of religious persecution most coptic christians in egypt have a tattoo of a cross on their wrist it is a sign of devotion to their christian faith when his arabic language teacher told ayman nabil labib to cover that tattoo in the classroom ayman pulled out the cross that was hanging around his neck for all in the classroom to see the teacher was enraged he choked ayman and asked his muslim classmates what are you going to do with him his classmates then beat ayman to death he was murdered in an egyptian classroom because he was a christian in libya isis captured and beheaded 21 people because they were christians from nearby egypt when the victims families wanted to build a church in their honor they were attacked by another muslim mob and beaten in syria the situation is even worse for christians in june 2013 a

they were christians or whether they were muslims here is what he said if you were a christian you were shot on the spot a spokesman for the terror group told the bbc that it attacked the school

attacked a shopping mall in kenya in 2013 they took a number of shoppers captive one of them was joshua hakim when joshua got close to his attackers he showed them his id but he covered up his christian name with his thumb they told me to go he recalled later then an indian man came forward and they said what is the name of mohammeds mother when he couldnt answer they just shot him on the spot there are many more unnamed christian martyrs who are persecuted for their faith the persecution of christians has been going on since stephen was stoned for his faith in acts 7 but what these current accounts show is that persecutions of christians around the world are growing in number and are being tolerated more by governments and in my opinion encouraged by some nonchristian societies we cannot deny this reality we must tell it like it is people should not make excuses for or cover up the widespread persecution of christians throughout the world governments terrorist groups and others should not get a pass and tacit hunting permits to kill christians the problem is rogue states like pakistan and iran and rogue terrorist groups like isis who get their legitimacy and power from imprisoning and killing christians as a country the united states needs to reexamine its relationship with states that persecute christians maybe we should give these countries less american money until they start protectinginstead of arrestingchristians we need to be singularly minded when it comes to describing groups like isis and what they really are they are evil they kill in the

his property was stolen and he was left for dead other people traveled down the same road saw the victim but they passed over on the other side of the road they went their own way and avoided this

from my friendsand i literally mean that friends i am not being sarcastic they are friendstalking about the shootings it sounds like they were certainly racist shootings in south carolina when an evil man shot brothers and sisters of mine as fellow christians now there is this big race to go after the confederate flag so i saw this article by daniel greenfield and felt like this was worth noting historically information that mr greenfield has published this month just touching on parts of the articlei started to say he but it says daniel maybe it is a man maybe it isnt i dont want to be biased based on a name but anyway in his article he says talking about president obama when obama condemned christianity for the crusades only a thousand years too late in attendance was the foreign minister of sudan a country that practices slavery and genocide president obama could have taken time out from his rigorous denunciation of the middle ages to speak truth to the emissary of a muslim brotherhood regime whose leader is wanted by the international criminal court for crimes against humanity but our moral liberals spend too much time romanticizing actual slaver cultures its a lot easier for our president to get in his milliondollar cadillac with 5inch thick bulletproof windows a ride boss hogg could only envy boss hogg being a reference to the name of the show dukes of hazzard and chase down a couple of good ole boys than it is to condemn a culture that committed genocide in our own time not in 1099 and that keeps slaves today not in 1815 even while the duke boys again references to dukes of hazzard the duke boys were chased through georgia president obama appeared at an iftar dinner an event at which muslims emulate mohammed who had more slaves than robert e lee there are no slaves in arlington house today but in the heartlands of islam from saudi mansions to isis dungeons there are still slaves laboring beaten bought sold raped and disposed of in mohammeds name slavery does not exist under the confederate flag eagerly being pulled down it does exist under the black and green flags of islam rising over mosques in iraq saudi arabia and america today in our incredibly tolerant culture it has become politically incorrect to watch the general lee talking about a car jump a fence or a barn but paying tribute to the culture that sent the slaves here and that still practices slavery is the culturally sensitive thing to do in 2015 slavery is no longer freedom but it certainly is tolerance the article goes on slavery was an indigenous african and middle eastern practice not to mention an indigenous practice in america among indigenous cultures the author here is talking about for those who dont understand indigenous cultures he is talking about native americans there were native americans that had slaves just like in africa and middle eastern practices the article goes on if justice demands that we pull down the confederate flag everywhere even from the top of the orange car sailing through the air in the freeze frame of an old television show then what possible justification is there for all the faux aztec knickknacks even the worst southern plantation owners didnt tear out the hearts of their slaves on top of pyramids this is a reference that obviously in history we understand aztecs did pull out hearts of slaves that they sacrificed on top of pyramids anyway the article says the romanticization of aztec brutality plays a crucial role in the mythology of mexican nationalist groups like la raza promoting the reconquista of america today i wasnt aware of that but the article says black nationalists romanticize the slaveholding civilization of egypt despite the fact that the narrative of the liberation of the hebrew slaves from bondage played a crucial role in the end of slavery in america the endless stories about the amazons of the african kingdom of dahomey neatly fit into the leftist myth of a peaceful matriarchal africa disrupted by european colonialism but dahomey ran on slavery the amazons helped capture slaves for the atlantic slave trade white and black liberals are romanticizing the very culture that captured and sold their forefathers into slavery in dahomey the first major mainstream black musical was about african americans moving to dahomey by then the french had taken over old dahomey and together with the british had put an end to the slave trade the french dismantled the amazons and freed many of dahomeys slaves only for the idiot descendants of both groups to romanticize the last noble stand of dahomey fighting for the right to export black slaves to cuba and condemn the european liberators who put a stop to that atrocity if we crack down on romanticizing dixie how can we possibly justify romanticizing dahomey or the aztecs or mohammed if slavery and racism are wrong which clearly they are the article says if slavery and racism are wrong then they are wrong across the board dahomey and mohammed had bought sold and killed enough black lives to be frowned upon if we go back far enough in time most cultures kept slaves the romans and greeks certainly did thats why the meaningful standard is not whether a culture ever had slaves but whether it has slaves today if we are going to eradicate the symbols of every culture that ever traded in slaves there will be few cultural symbols that will escape unscathed but the academics who insist on cultural relativism in 19th century africa reject it in 19th century south carolina thereby revealing their own racism and so instead of fighting actual modernday slavery in africa and the middle east social justice warriors are swarming to invade hazzard county most of the cultures of the past that we admire respect and even romanticize had slaves but when we look back at their achievements and even try to forge some connection to them it does not have to mean an endorsement of their worst habits this is a concept that liberals understood but that leftists reject the recent hysteria reminds us that the nuanced reason of the former has been replaced by the irrational destructive impulses of the latter the left is so obsessed with creating utopias of the future that like the taliban or isis it destroys the relics of past societies that do not measure up to its impossible standards and then it replaces them with imaginary utopias of the past that never existed as ben carson pointed out we will not get rid of racism by banning the confederate flag even when it is used at its worst by the likes of dylann storm roof it is a symptom not the problem roof was not radicalized by the dead confederacy but by the racial tensions kicked off i am not sure i want to say that but anyway interesting take but all of this talk about eliminating any references or uses of things that remind us of the horrors the abomination that slavery was in the united states should be eliminated that is what we are hearing and so in thinking about thatand the suggestion was made by my friend another judge from texas judge carter so i had to go look it up i think there is an entity that was so evil in supporting slavery in fighting against civil rights in fighting against the christian brother that martin luther king jr was fighting against those who wanted equality that the constitution guaranteed we ought to look at those symbols and we ought to look at what they stood for and perhaps ban any political organization from participating in congress for upholding the abomination that slavery was to this country so i was able to get a copy of this platform this political platform from 1856 this is the number one plank in the platform of this hideous political organization and this is what they believed and they asserted i am reading from the number one plank in their party platform that congress has no power under the constitution to interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several states and that such states are the sole and proper judges of everything appertaining to their own affairs not prohibited by the constitution then here it goes that all efforts of the abolitionists or others made to induce congress to interfere with questions of slavery or to take incipient steps in relation thereto are calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences and that all such efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of the union and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our political institutions that was the official number one plank in this hideous political organizations platform from 1856 they go on here is number three that by the uniform application of this democratic principle to the organization of territories and to the admission of new states with or without domestic slavery as they may electthe equal rights of all the states will be preserved intact they are saying they want to preserve slavery in any state that wants to have it they finish up by saying resolved that we recognize the right of the people of all the territories including kansas and nebraska acting through the legally and fairly expressed will of a majority of actual residents and whenever the number of their inhabitants justifies it to form a constitution with or without domestic slavery it sounds like something the ku klux klan would have done they are demanding that they have the right to have slavery the worst abomination in the history of america that even thomas jefferson put in his original draft of the declaration of independence that it was a horrible grievance against the king of england for allowing slavery this horrible abomination from ever starting in america well they didnt learn their lesson this hideous political organizations platform in 1860 said they were adopting all the things that they had said in 1856 about the right to keep this heinous offensive slavery intact they include this though additionally in their platform of 1860 resolved that the enactment of the state legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the fugitive slave law are hostile in character subversive of the constitution and revolutionary in their effect they want to make it clear that not only were they avid supporters of slavery in america but that it was their right to own people in america this disgusting political organization also found the fugitive slave law to be as they say hostile in character subversive of the constitution again this sounds like something from the ku klux klan will we want the ku klux klan participating here on the floor when this is their history it is the worst abomination the horrors of slavery finally were overcome largely by abolitionist churches and pastors people who believed that it had to stop that people couldnt be treating brothers and sisters in such a way it took the life work and even laying down of the life of martin luther king jr to push us to the level where brothers and sisters as he was in christ could treat brothers and sisters as equal people that is where we should have been all along it is where he was pushing us to be against the hideous type things from 1856 and 1860 if we are going to eliminate everything that reminds us of a hideous past that supported slavery and the oppression the horrors that slavery entailedbreaking up of families molestations the beatings just the horrorsjohn quincy adams was right god could not continue to bless america while we were treating brothers and sisters by putting them in chains and bondage he was right so many abolitionists were right daniel webster was right republicans that stood up to these hideous political organizations were right there should be no place for slavery in america if we are going to have a complete cleansing of this country of anything any symbol then this platform from the democratic party in 1856 and 1860and it wasnt the ku klux klan it sounded like it and there were a lot of democrats who were members of the ku klux klan i dont know that you can find republicans that were members of the ku klux klan but there were certainly plenty of democrats that were i think it is time not for the washington redskins to change their name but for the democratic party to change its name because all you have to do is go online and look up the history of the democratic party it is one of oppressing african americans it is one of supporting slavery and the horrors that occurred in the united states even up through the 20th century on into the 1860s i think we had a democratic senator who was a member of the ku klux klan i think he has got a lot of things named after him i hope that my friends who will ultimately want to change the name of the democratic party because of its horrible history will also want to change the names of things that were named after somebody that was a big supporter of the ku klux klan the fact is the families of the victims in charleston south carolinabrothers and sisters in christ for those of us who are christianswow did they send a powerful message i didnt see or hear them demanding the confederate flag be taken down i heard them forgive the onethe evil horrible personthat committed such a vile act

for and against different things yesterday we saw the reauthorization of the exportimport bank and i voted no on that of course i like probably every single member of congress have businesses in the district that i represent that use the exportimport bank to further their business hire their employees and help their community so why would somebody vote against the exportimport bank i am here to tell you why we have a tradition in america of a freemarket value and its wanted standing in the world it is not by a corrupt system of cronyism and political favor and that is what the exportimport bank is to me unfortunately while many small businesses in every community use the exportimport bank fully 98 percent of businesses dont use the exportimport bank to do their exporting98 percent but that is not really the issue the issue is other things for instance between 2007 and 2014 more than 51 percent of all exim subsidies benefited just 1010corporations one in particular benefited from 66 7 billion in subsidies during the past 7 years we cant fix social security and we cant afford our military but we can sure afford for 10 corporations to get 51 percent because it is not really about the small business in your community generally speaking as a matter of fact foreign firms that receive most of exim financing are large corporations that primarily purchase exports from unitedstates conglomerates not from main street businesses five of the top 10 buyers are statecontrolled and rake in millions of dollars from their own governments in addition to exim bank subsidies that the taxpayers are on the hook for five of 10 are involved in exploration development and production of oil or natural gas these foreign firms collecting subsidies from american taxpayers at the same time that this administration is restricting domestic oil and gas operations right here at home consequently the federal government has doubly disadvantaged unitedstates energy firms through excessive regulation and exim bank subsidies granted to foreign competitors now sometimes in washington it is not what you know but it is who you know of the 16 members of the exim banks 2014 advisory committee half fully half were executives at companies or unions that directly benefited from exim financing during their termfully half does that sound remotely suspicious to anybody another five members represent companies or unions that received exim assistance shortly before they joined and i will give you an example since 2011 former energy secretary and new mexico governor bill richardson has held a seat on spanish energy company abengoas international advisory board shortly after joining the firm mr richardson was appointed to the exim advisory board right around the same time the two exim bank loans benefiting abengoa were issued fascinating coincidence those taxpayerbacked loans totaled around 150 million supporters of exim argue that the advisory committee members being associated with their beneficiaries is a positive feature to the contrary i think it shows that a corporate cronyism atmosphere exists at exim and will continue to exist at exim the office of the ig and the gao the government accountability office repeatedly document mismanagement dysfunction within exim including inefficient policies and procedures to guard against waste fraud and abuse fully 124 investigations have been initiated between october 2007 and march 2014 as well as 792 separate claims involving more than 500 million and 74 administrative actions since april of 2009 in which bank officials were forced to act internally on the basis of investigations by the inspector general the congressional budget office reported that exim programs actually operate at a deficit because we also are told that it makes the american taxpayer money but we dont really know because they use their own accounting system not used anywhere else actually the cbo says that will cost taxpayers 2 billion in the next decade and you wonder why certain members of congress dont vote for this thing it is not about the small businesses in our communities that are trying to do a good job and play by the rules because they are doing a good job and playing by the rules but there is a bigger issue here there is more to the story the new bill that we just passed guarantees an audit every 4 yearsevery 4 years but keep in mind that exim currently has around 30 open investigations 75 years of combined prison time 90 criminal indictments and complaints 49 criminal judgments more than 223 million in courtordered fines and restitution and i could go on the exim bank doesnt do everything it could for small business but it does a lot for people that know people in this town that is why it must be

invaluable service to the budget debate by bringing into sharp relief two very different visions of governance advanced by the two parties the progressive budget is sincere and bold unfortunately it is also wrong it would hike taxes by 7 trillion over the next 10 years relative to the republican budget hike spending by 9 3 trillion and run up 2 8 trillion more in debt than the republican budget over 10 years now lets begin with a reality check here divide 1 trillion into the number of families in this country every trillion dollars we throw around here is roughly 8 000 taken from an average familys earnings some of that they see as direct taxes some of that they see as increased prices or depressed wages as businesses pass along their costs to consumers and employees but ultimately it is paid by working americans because that is where the bulk of our economy rests so 3 8 trillion in increased taxes means roughly 30 000 taken from the earnings of an average family over the next 10 years 2 8 trillion in increased debt means another 22 000 of debt added to that familys obligations that they will have to pay in future taxes we are told well dont worry rich people will pay all those taxes the problem is there arent enough rich people in the country to begin to make more than a dent in these numbers it turns out many of the socalled rich people arent rich and they arent even people they are struggling small businesses filing under subchapter s and remember this dirty little secret of finance businesses do not pay business taxes the only three possible ways a business tax can be paid is by consumers through higher prices by employees through lower wages and by investors through lower earnings that is your 401 k or your pension plan that we are talking about we are told well dont worry we are using that money to create wealth and jobs well the problem is government doesnt create wealth because government cannot inject a dollar into the economy until it has first taken that same dollar out of the economy true we see the job that government creates when it puts the dollar back in what we dont see as clearly is the job that is lost when government first takes that dollar out of the economy we see those lost jobs in the lowest labor participation rate in nearly 40 years and in declining median incomes for working americans here is what government can doand what the progressive democratic budget proposes it can transfer jobs from the private sector to the public sector by taxing one and expanding the other it can transfer jobs from one sector of the private market to the other by taxing one and subsidizing the other in fact that is precisely the difference between apple computer and solyndra it is the difference between fedex and the post office it is the difference between the reagan recovery and the obama recovery in fact it has been estimated that if the obama recovery had mirrored the reagan recovery millions more americans would be working today and family incomes would be thousands of dollars higher than they are today but of course reagan diagnosed the problem very differently than this administration you remember his famous words in this great economic crisis government is not the solution to our problemsgovernment is the problem he dramatically reduced the tax burden from 70 percent down to 28 percent he reduced spending by 2 percent of gdp he rolled back many of the regulatory burdens imposed on our economy and the result was one of the most dramatic and prolonged economic expansions in our nations history and it wasnt just reagan we forget that after the 1994 congressional election bill clinton realized his policies werent working he came here to this floor in his state of the union address and proclaimed the era of big government is over and he made good on that promise he reached across the aisle to work with the republican congress and together they accomplished some amazing things they reduced federal spending by 4 percent of gdp they approved what amounted to the biggest capital gains tax cut in american history they dramatically reduced entitlement spending byin clintons words ending welfare as we know it the result was the only four budget surpluses in the last half century and another period of prolonged economic expansion and the percentage of children living in poverty dropped dramatically the budget reported by the house budget committee employs these principles that worked when reagan and clinton used them and worked when john f kennedy and harry truman and warren harding used them the republican house budget gradually reduces spending as a percentage of gdp it calls for a lower flatter tax rate it puts our nation back on a course to a balanced budget it saves medicare from bankrupting and collapsing on an entire generation of americans it takes us off the path of debt and doubt and despair that this administration has dogmatically followed and restores us to policies that have repeatedly brought prosperity to our nation government cannot create jobs but it can create conditions where jobs multiply and prosper or where they stagnate and disappear that it can do very well and we have very consistent experience with the policies that create these conditions increase the burdens on the economy and the economy contracts lighten the burdens on the economy and it grows and prospers that is what is out of control with this administration no nation has ever taxed and spent its way to prosperity but many nations have taxed and spent their way to economic ruin and bankruptcy we know what works we know what doesnt work the house budget committees balanced budget for a stronger america follows principles that have time and again consistently and

order which is characteristic of her leadership in this congress i am so pleased that our chair rep g k butterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from several other members i just want to say a few words about this troika of african americans who have written their signatures across our time you have heard their biographies i dont want to recount their extraordinary bios because that is not the only reason we are honoring them with this special order i just want to say something about what they meant to me two of them i knew personally representative louis stokes whose many years in the congress happened to overlap with my first years here and of course julian bond whom i knew best i was not fortunate to know amelia boynton she may have been the most courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s who insisted upon facing death if necessary in that march from selma to montgomery and nearly lost her life i was privileged to be in her presence as so many members of congress were when we went to selma this past summer that was a privilege in and of itself i was fortunate to know congressman louis stokes who was a founder of the congressional black caucus long before i served this was a man of great accomplishment yes he can speak about his firsts and much more he is the first african american to serve in congress from his hometown of cleveland as one of the two famous stokes brothershis brother carl the first african american mayor there is something about the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public life but it is rep stokes career in congress that stands out for me i am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished member of this body it looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do something hard they looked to louis stokes he was the first african american to serve on the appropriations committee my heavens and then look at the committees he has chairedhard onesthe ethics committee the house permanent select committee on intelligence then they needed someone to do something else that was difficult and that was to serve on the iran contra committee and house select committee on assassinations nothing was more difficult than that if you were looking for a member whom the public would trust and who this body would trust who do you go to they went to louis stokes so if you are trying to find out how to serve recall the life of representative louis stokes in the district we recall his life and his work much of his work was done in the field of health the howard university louis stokes health science library is named for him here in the district of columbia at howard university so we will never forget him of the three the one i knew best of course was my colleague and friend in the student nonviolent coordinating committee later a client of sorts and then finallyfor 25 years a constituent i met julian several years after he founded along with a handful of other students the student nonviolent coordinating committee you have got to understand that that group was as different from any student group since they were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement they were a group that stood on its own i would go down in the summers i was in law school sncc was the equivalent of major civil rights organizations every single one right alongside them that is why john lewis got to speak on the march on washington the reason that sncc stood out is the quality of its leadership in those early years julian became the spokesman the reason he was the spokesman was his way with words he was a poet and a writer and he could explain what we were doing he served a most valuable role in these early years so no one should be surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement to serve in the georgia house of representatives what you may be surprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate the georgia senate they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a sncc statement opposing the vietnam war imagine denying a seat to a member duly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great moment this case was taken all the way to the supreme court at that point i was a constitutional lawyer working for the american civil liberties union in new york i got to write the amicus brief we took very few amicus briefs to the supreme court but this one seemed to have the makings of a landmark case indeed it did become a landmark case you do not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seator her seat todaybecause of that persons views the julian bond case settled the matter what was julian bond to do with the rest of his life first of all sncc broke a fair number of people and though they gave much to the movement you may not have heard about many of them since what julian did was to give the rest of his life to the movement for every single day of his life as a man after he left public service in the georgia legislature he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered as a very young man he moved to the district of columbia with his wife taught at american university and the university of virginia and becameand this is a matter that makes me chucklebecame the chairman of the naacp at sncc we thought the naacp was way too conservative for us the young and foolish it tells you how julian grew he grew to be the longtime and devoted chairman of the naacp he carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently throughout his entire life he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights movement and for progressive causes his entire life speaking all around the country carrying the message when he moved here i had a black caucus event with julian and with john lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil rights movement that was to be one of the most memorable moments since i have been in congress just last february during black history month i asked julian to come to howard university where he and i engaged in an intergenerational conversation with howard students about the police shootings in ferguson missouri and new york city and what they meant to this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues and move in its own direction one of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the youth of the civil rights movement of our day we never touched racial profiling it remained alive and kicking for a new generation which has taken it on i am finally particularly grateful that when julian moved to the district of columbia he really became a part of this city lending his civil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full citizenship for d c voting rights yes and for statehood for the district of columbia if you came into the district by taxis a few years ago there was an advertisement julian was speaking in a cab informing you that you were coming to the district of columbia where the residents were trying to get their full citizenship wherever he was he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom of the day and of the people around him i will always miss

walking until they secured the freedoms promised to them by the unitedstates constitution as they crossed the edmund pettus bridge a wall of alabama state troopers were waiting at the foot of the bridge news stations from across the country televised the brutality that followed as foot soldiers like hosea williams john lewis amelia boynton robinson reverend f d reese bob nance of lowndes county albert turner sr of perry county and so many others were attacked on edmund pettus bridge on what has become known as bloody sunday the journey of the foot soldiers we honor today was not an easy one they were discriminated by whites and ostracized by blacks who were afraid to join them but still they persevered because they could no longer bear the burdens of secondclass citizenship the president of the dallas county voters league reverend f d reese wasnt going to let nobody turn him around he told me he said that given the conditions that existed in selma and the south at that time he wanted to make sure that things were different he was willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure that peopleno matter their race color or creedwould have the right to vote he said the lord gave us determination to keep moving forward we were determined to let the lord lead us and direct us so that all people regardless of their color would have access to the political process he went on we were not at all afraid because we were determined that whatever it took even if it meant our lives we were going to move alabama and the states and this nation forward amelia boynton robinson literally felt the blows of injustice as she was beaten on the bridge by alabama state troopers and left for dead amelias will and dignity suffered no damage but it made her more resolved than ever to

petition the government through peaceful protest and ordered federal agents to provide full protection to the foot soldiers during the selma to montgomery march under court order the unitedstates army the federalized alabama national guard and countless federal agencies and marshals escorted more than 8 000 foot soldiers on march 21 1965 as these brave men and women began their historic 54mile journey from selma to the steps of the alabama state capitol in montgomery alabama the extraordinary bravery and sacrifices these foot soldiers displayed in pursuit of a peaceful march from selma to

was created by congress the board of governors are all appointed for terms of 14 years by the president and confirmed by congress and it operates per its charter and laws set out by yes congress therefore the federal reserve is actually or theoretically is supposed to be accountable to congress today the federal reserve is one of the most powerful institutions in the world it is past time to restore transparency at the fed and hold it accountable to the american taxpayers the unitedstates federal reserve system or the fed as it is known was created in 1913 in response to a series of economic crises early in the 20th century although the fed was created as an independent agency deriving its power from congress over the past 100 years the feds power has significantly expanded while originally created to provide stability to the banking business the federal reserve has gained unprecedented power influence and control over the financial system while remaining shrouded in mystery to the american people at the same time the american people have continued to suffer through a financial crisis at least once per generation with such a poor record the fed should not be free to carry on without accountability to the institution that created it we will not fully realize robust economic growth until the fed changes the conduct of its monetary policy six years have passed since the recession officially ended but the unitedstates economic opportunity remains well short of its potential the fed must be accountable to the peoples representatives as well as to the hardworking

those bills that is one of the ways that they discover what is in those bills but if they actually read this bill they would see that it protects the feds ability to develop what it believes is the best course of action on monetary policythe exact opposite of what my colleague was saying it requires them to then give the american people a greater accounting of its actions my bill directs the federal reserve to transparently communicate its monetary policy decisions to the american taxpayersnot what it must do as is being asserted rather they must simply explain what they are doing and why they are doing it by requiring the fed to regularly communicate how its policy choices compare to a benchmark guideline instead of continuing the ad hoc strategy currently being employed the form act will help consumers and investors make better decisions in both the present and create more sound expectations about the future even chair yellen once championed the merits of this approach stating that the framework of a taylortype rule could help the federal reserve communicate to the public the rationale behind policy moves the form act does not dictate any particular monetary policy course it simply ensures that the fed transparently communicates its monetary policy decisions i cant agree more with chair yellen second the form act reforms the federal reserves emergency lending powers

undermine a states guarantee tomorrow this in turn invites credit markets to question such guarantees as being no longer secured on constitutional bedrock but rather dependent upon the shifting whims of congress this in turn means the value of these bonds is devalued and interest rates paid by taxpayers on that debt will increase the governors of six states have already raised this warning and the unitedstates virgin islands whose credit is directly undermined by promesa wants out of the bill for the same reason now promesa could have respected the 18 billion of constitutionally guaranteed debt and focused instead on restructuring the 54 billion of puerto rican municipal debt that is not constitutionally guaranteed after all there is no reason to treat san juans municipal debt any differently than san joses but constitutionally issued debt is fundamentally different and its reliability must be maintained tellingly supporters of this bill voted down just such an amendment in committee supporters have said they have addressed this concern by inserting instructions to the control board to respect the relative lawful priorities in the constitution other laws or agreements but ironically one of those other laws the control board is instructed to respect is the governments repudiation of that debt furthermore the same section instructs the control board to provide adequate funding for public pension systems and includes other contradictory instructions the only possible interpretation of these provisions is that the sanctity of the sovereign debt is subject to balancing and therefore subordination to junior claims by the control board just last week treasury secretary jack lew and the white house admitted that this was both the intent and effect of the bill meanwhile another provision of promesa prevents lawful bondholders from enforcing their claims in court for a period of 6 months but doesnt prevent the government from paying out junior claims during this period indeed in anticipation of this bill the new budget for puerto rico increases general fund spending while it radically reduces its debt service payments honoring the rule of law and maintaining the commonwealths full faith and credit guarantee would be a powerful signal to bond markets that the united states stands by its promises even when it is inconvenient under current law it is in the interest of both sides debtor and creditor to work out terms that both can live with to restructure and repay this debt indeed until the prospect of a congressional rescue arose puerto rico was negotiating terms of a debt restructuring with the mutual consent of its creditors it is also in the interest of the people of puerto rico to uphold the full faith and credit clause of their constitution which will be vitally important for them to reenter the credit market once their affairs are put back in order puerto rico faces both crisis and opportunity a crisis born of slavish devotion to failed leftist economic policies and an opportunity to replace those policies with proven free market solutions that can create a fresh start for the people of puerto rico and shine as a beacon of hope for other similarly afflicted states i fear the net result of this legislation will be to spread the crisis to other states with heavy debts by increasing their debt service costs"],

something that needed to be addressed it was a problem that has been growing for about 16 years or so the cut that was put into law has been changed 17 times in the last 16 or so years it made cuts to healthcare providers we have caused some healthcare providers to retire early it was 716 billion that obamacare took from medicare in order to supposedly fund 30 million or so that we were told didnt have insurance now we have cost millions their health insurance policy they liked and i say we not a single republican voted for that bill it has cost americans millions of americans the doctor that they wanted to use we have seen promise after promise that was made about obamacare that was broken it absolutely wasnt true then we find out that there were advisers around the white house who were advising all along they are not going to be able to keep their insurance policy they are not going to be able to keep their doctors maybe we want to change the way that kind of thing is said it did major damageand continues to do major damageto health care so on top of that overlay we had these ongoing cuts to the healthcare providers if we didnt step in each year and temporarily pause them it would have put so many healthcare providers out of business and made it extremely difficult for americans to get the health care they need even more than it already is even more than obamacare has jeopardized so something needed to be done my friend dr mike burgess had pushed through a fix a remedy last year of 63 pages it was very well thought out he is a very bright terrific doctor a great congressman and a friend we have spent a lot of time this week talking about the fix to the cuts to reimbursement for physicians and the bill today on the good side provided a permanent fix if this becomes law if the senate passes what we did it stops the slow deletion of some healthcare providers efforts and work this provides a framework from which medicare can be reformed for the future it is valued at 175 billion and the best estimate we have gotten is that 140 billion of the 175 billion is not offset with any cuts anywhere else this would be a straight addition of 140 billion to our childrens and grandchildrens enormous debtwhat some refer to as intergenerational theft it does have henry hyde language protecting against federal funds being used for abortion i have always thought the world of henry hyde and was honored to overlap with him 2 years his work in standing for the unborn children the most innocent among us is just an extraordinary lifes work that he did i dont know that federal funds for abortions for people on medicare is as big an issue as some might think anyway the hyde language is in there it puts it in the tax code that is a big deal some of my democratic friends were not big on that there is also reauthorization for chip there are the secure rural schools our rural schools especially those in national parks have been cheated for many years from the income that they were supposed to have by giving up land they couldnt tax any more by giving up other sources of revenue from the land they agreed to allow land to be used or become national forests and they were to be reimbursed by proceeds from the sale of timber but we have a forest service administrationnot just this one it has been going for a whilewhere production has either slowed dramatically or completely been eliminated even though pine trees where i live are an entirely renewable resource you plant them and you are ready to harvest them in 15 20 years we are not talking sequoias we are just talking a renewable resource it is well managed in east texas and other places around the country but since production has stopped and we are buying so much lumber from other countries now it is not good for america not good for our trade imbalance but it has been a federal government policy and it has put schools in an extremely detrimental position especially in rural areas especially in areas where there have been national forests so it is nice to have another bandaid so to speak to address that issue it should have been in here it should have been done before now but on the other side getting back to 140 billion that is not offset by cuts anywhere else adding it into the intergenerational theftand it also concerns me we had 212 republicans today that voted for this sgr fix it would have been so easy to have enough of an adjustment into this bill that we could add six more republicans and it would have been able to pass without any republican leader begging for support from the democrats without coming to support from conservatives with the vote on dhs funding we saw 167 republicans voted against it because it didnt keep our promise to stop the illegal unconstitutional amnesty that dhs had done as ordered by the president and there were 75 republicans some of whom are very conservative but they did vote with the speaker on that bill and with the majority of democrats to pass that funding but i think that gives us an indication that out of the republican conferencethe massive portion of the republican conference represents very conservative districts and there are republicans that thank god we have that are from more moderate areas but somewhere between onefourth and onethird perhaps it just seems like this bill today was one of those bills where we would be better off if we negotiated a deal among the republicans and go through regular order that is what we promised you put us in the majority we will go through regular order we will have hearings on this entire bill there will be open opportunities to discuss it to amend it to have legislative hearings before you even do the votes on it in committee we didnt do that the bill was filed 2 days ago on the 24th we had a couple of days with this bill that is not adequate for something this important it does add some means testing for seniors it appears very clear it is going to cause healthcare providers to have to add more clerical workerspeople that dont do health care they just do paperwork so there will be more costs so we didnt have a chance to adequately investigate the terminology of this bill and the longterm effects it will have on health care it is kind of important this also came 1 day after we voted for a budget that was important to get to the point where we could have reconciliation that let us deal with important issues like obamacare we passed the budget easily and we had a number of different budgets we could vote for i thought tom price did a good job of marshalling the efforts on that but the point is most of us were so focused on the budget through the vote yesterday that we really had one night to prepare on this sgr with the actual language that was filed on tuesday i was good with the 63 pages dr burgess had used last year but there were over 200 pages i really dont know the longterm effects of what we did and that is why though i have been clamoring for an sgr fix i couldnt vote for it this isnt how we do things we are supposed to first do no harm we dont know what harm we may have done in that bill we know we did some good but we dont know what harm we should have had some more time to analyze this and take the language back to our physicians our healthcare providers and say youre the one doing this youre the one trying to save lives enhance lives what will this do to you what will this language do to you then come back and have the vote so i appreciate the work for those that have been spending so much time on what is often referred to as the doctor fix we definitely needed that as another fix this is more permanent we dont know what the senate will do and that is another one of our problems there is some rather breathtaking news that has come out today about what the obama administration has done in the way of damage to the nation of israelit sounds like this action was extremely pettyin an effort to slap israel without proper regard for the fact that they are the most important ally we have anywhere in the middle east and one of the very most important allies we have in the world it is just breathtaking what was done actually to put this in perspective this article march 23 from joel pollak says obamas chief of staff fires up j street israels occupation must end the article says white house chief of staff denis mcdonough earned raucous cheers from the leftwing activists gathered at j streets fifth annual conference in washington on monday when he attacked israels occupation of the west bank an occupation that has lasted almost 50 years must end j street was founded to disrupt the close unitedstates israel alliance and to serve as an alternative to the american israel public affairs committee the powerful proisrael group well that is interesting if we use mr mcdonoughs rationale about the israel occupation and how it must end then that would mean that at the turn of the 20th century if he had been around clamoring for on behalf of this presidentwere he president around the end of the 1800she would have been saying it is time to end americas occupation of texas had he been around in say 1823 speaking for president obama back then had he been president then if he used this same reasoning he would have been saying it is time for the occupation of our thirteen colonies to stop and we give all the land back to england this is no time for the thirteen colonies to continue to occupy what we are calling the united states it is time to give that back to england it was theirs originally the french had some at one time there were differing claims but basically time to quit occupying the united states and give this all back to england it is time to give the west of the united states you might have heard him say if he had been around in the early 20th century time to give back all the west to whoever had it before whether it was mexico spain whoever may have been claiming it we have been occupying it that is not the way the world works that is not the way the united states worked native american tribes were constantly taking each other on different parts of the country taking over others land that has gone on around the world when you have a group of people living in the nation of israel saying we refuse to ever recognize israels right to exist we want to wipe the jewish people off the map we want to wipe israel off the map then that is not a nation that you sit down with then when you have a nation like iran that is doingthey make clear even as of last week that the top leaders in iran want death to america well apparently when this administration hears a religious fanatic that has killed american soldiers killed american civilians has really been at the lead of killing americans wherever they could find them and have an opportunity to kill them and want to wipe israel off the map as the little satan and wipe america off the map as the great satanthey have continued to pursue nuclear weapons and while this administration was rushing and continue to rush to talk to the leaders in iran it leaves some of us aghast at how blind the administration can be as to who is our friend and who is our enemy it was denis mcdonough this article talks about speaking to the group according to this article that was founded to disrupt the close relationship between unitedstates and israel and he fired them up saying the occupation that lasted almost 50 years must end it reminded me oh yeah i remember another speech he gave and this transcript is from the white house web site this was march 6 of 2011 and denis mcdonough the same guy that thinks we need to run israel out of the land of israel he said thisand i am quoting from the speech from the white house web site thank you imam magid for your very kind introduction and welcome i know that president obama was very grateful that you led the prayer at last summers iftar dinner at the white house which as the president noted is a tradition stretching back more than two centuries to when thomas jefferson hosted the first iftar at the white house thank you also for being one of our i might parenthetically interject here into mr mcdonoughs speech glowing praise for imam magid that actually this is imam magid who was president of the islamic society of north america the islamic society of north america a little background on them they were named as a coconspirator to fund terrorism in the largest prosecution in the united states history for funding of terrorismthis was in a united states district court in dallasin short referred to as the holy land foundation trial they were the main defendant their principals the list of unindicted coconspirators from that trial included the council on american islamic relations cair the islamic society of north america isna and the north american islamic trust nait these coconspirators were not tried in the first round of prosecutions in dallas under the bush administration but in november of 2008 all five defendants were convicted on a massive number of charges of supporting terrorism the evidence utilized in the first round of the prosecutions some that participated anticipate would be used in another trial against other named coconspirators if they were successful in getting the first convictions which they did however before the convictions were finalized there was an election president obama was elected president and we got a new attorney general and they decided despite what the evidence showed despite what the courts had found they are not going to prosecute the islamic society of north america and caircair has a very lovely building just down the street from us here i can see cair from my window in the case in dallas cair nait isna they filed pleadings demanding that the judge remove their names as coconspirators in supporting terrorism the judge reviewed all the evidence had the hearing and he ruled that their names would not be struck as coconspirators because there was plenty of evidence to support them as coconspirators supporting terrorism they appealed that to the fifth circuit court of appeals for the united states and the fifth circuit in their order confirmed that there was a prima facie case made that the entities cair nait isna those associations have strong associations with the muslim brotherhood namely hamas its palestinian branch which was specifically designated as a terrorist organization by the unitedstates government anyway the organization here that the federal courts found had plenty of evidence to make a case against them as supporters of terrorism have become partners with this administration and that is why denis mcdonough who was getting the acclaim for demanding israel leave part of israeli territory he was there back in 2011 giving praise to imam magid thanking him for his wonderful prayers at the white house this is a guy that is president of what two federal courts have said had plenty of evidence to show they are coconspirators in supporting terrorism this business about oh the long tradition going back to thomas jefferson of iftar at the white house iftar is the celebration during the month of augustor after the fasting during the month of august for the religious observance of muslims and iftar is the feast after the fasting if you go back to what they say was the first iftar under thomas jefferson it doesnt appear to me that jefferson realized he was having an iftar dinner he wanted to have a dinner with a muslim leader and he couldnt do it until the fasting was over and so when he could eat they had a meal it is kind of like hearing people say well thomas jefferson having a copy of the koran shows how openminded it was no it shows the fact that he had been a diplomat negotiating with radical islamists called barbary pirates as to why they kept capturing united states navynot navybut seamen and holding them for ransom they had so many of our sailors that they held in captivity we were paying a massive part of our budget for ransom to get these back jefferson was one of those that went over and negotiated and apparently asked why do you keep attacking us we dont even have a navy why you are attacking us we are not a threat to you he was reportedly told in our religion we believe that if we die while attacking you an infidel we go to paradise jefferson was so well read he couldnt believe there was a religion that thought you could go to paradise if you die killing innocent people so he got his own english translation of the koran his ultimate action was to create and send a new thing called united states marines to the shores of tripoli because he realized there is not going to be any negotiation that is adequate to deal with these radical islamists there is only one way to beat them and that is to physically beat them in a fight to the finish it kept them off our backs for some time well that is denis mcdonough speaking for the president in 2011 and now then we know that the white house is doing everything it can to bend over backwards the state department oh iran what can we do for you okay now we find out today they are going to let them have centrifuges spinning in their secret facility they didnt even disclose until we found out about it and they are going to let them keep having centrifuges spin there look they will almost do anything to get them to sign some kind of agreement bending over backwards but they cant spare a minute to meet with the leader of israel cant spare the president vice president or one of the cabinet to come listen to netanyahuoh no then today this outrage has come to light that the united states the obama administration has declassified a document that reveals israels nuclear program to the world especially to iran and to those who want to destroy israel so they will know exactly what they are after what they are up against what has happened what has come to light today of this administration declassifying a document obviously it is a slap at netanyahu it is a slap at the israeli people for coming out in droves to support a group of representatives that this president doesnt approve of we are betraying this great ally of ours israel if you believe the bible judgment will be coming down on our country for what our elected officials and appointed officials have done in betraying israel there will be problems for this if you dont believe the bible then just use common sense when you betray your most trusted ally in this tornapart middle east then you are going to have problems galore i have talked with leaders in those countries i cant now because the speaker wont let me go talk to them overseas anymore that is what you call retribution if you dont support the speaker i get that i am fine with that as a result of him canceling my trip this weekend i get to be on fox news

bible you could go back to king hezekiah who entertained the babylonian leaders if you believe the account in the bible god sent isaiah to hezekiah and asked him what have you done he already knew but hezekiah said in effectand this is texas paraphrasewell we met with these lovely wonderful leaders from babylon and we showed them all of our treasure in the most correct translation he adds and we showed them all of the defenses we have in our arsenal isaiah basically says because you have done that you fool you will lose the country this is the kind of thing that brings down nations it was

our seniors during older americans month this month i rise to draw attention to an issue that often goes overlooked in our communities and that is the terrible problem of hunger among aging adults food insecurity among seniors has doubled since 2001 and is expected to increase significantly as the baby boomer generation ages today food insecurity impacts 5 million seniors across the country forcing them to make impossible decisions between food medical care home heating and other necessities we know that hunger is a health issue and that is especially true among seniors over the age of 60 research from feeding america suggests that compared to their foodsecure neighbors seniors suffering from hunger are 60 percent more likely to experience depression 53 percent more likely to report a heart attack 52 percent more likely to develop asthma and 40 percent more likely to report an experience of congestive heart failure baby boomers spend twice as much on health care as young adults do ensuring seniors have access to nutritious food is vitally important we know that seniors have unique nutritional needs and i am pleased to see scientists collaborating to create nutritional guidance for seniors researchers at the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university with support from the aarp foundation recently unveiled an updated myplate for older adults graphic to help seniors visualize what foods cover the nutritional needs that make up a healthy plate for adults their age the new icon also encourages them to follow healthy eating patterns i was pleased to join scientists from tufts as well as representatives of aarp last week at a briefing on capitol hill to unveil the new myplate icon and educate congressional staff on the importance of senior nutrition but if we want to ensure seniors have access to nutritious foods we must also ensure that they have the ability to afford fruits vegetables and other healthy options one critical step we can take toward the goal of ending senior hunger is closing what is referred to as the senior snap gap while millions of our parents grandparents teachers and friends are facing hunger only a fraction of lowincome seniors eligible for food assistance through snap are accessing the benefits presumably because of the stigma associated with assistance or because seniors are unaware they qualify for benefits many seniors also suffer from limited mobility or may have issues completing benefit applications which can be complex and very timeconsuming in fact seniors are more likely than any other age group to be eligible for snap but they are not enrolled to receive the benefits that is why i am pleased to see so many advocacy organizations using older americans month to call attention to the issue of senior hunger through their hashtag solve senior hunger campaign feeding america and other antihunger and aging organizations across the country are reaching out to seniors and their loved ones to raise awareness and ensure that those seniors who are eligible to receive snap benefits are connected to the appropriate resources we should do all we can to help solve senior hunger by talking to our family members and friends about senior hunger and by partnering with leaders in our communities who work to improve access to nutritious food for senior populations during my years in congress i have had the opportunity to visit food banks and other organizations in my district that are working to end hunger among seniors last year i had the privilege of spending a day with a meals on wheels program that is based in northampton massachusetts which is part of my congressional district i helped to prepare and deliver meals and had the opportunity to speak with seniors who were served through this incredible program members of congress have an important role in ensuring our nations seniors dont go hungry i encourage all of my colleagues to spend time with similar programs in their districts congress must adequately fund programs like meals on wheels which provides nutritious food to seniors and reject harmful cuts to snap which will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us children seniors and the disabled that hunger is still a big problem in america the richest country in the history of the world and it should make us all ashamed but

it provides flexibility for only 19 refusetopower plants across this country and it saves money because it would cost 2 billion in pennsylvania alone just to clean up that refuse around these coal mines it is dangerous and it is bad for the environment providing this flexibility does not change our overall emissions but it does help get those reclamation sites cleaned up cheaper not as a cost to the taxpayer and provides an additional benefit of jobs in energy that sounds pretty american to me i think it is time to end this war on coal that some people in this administration and the other side of the aisle have that is what the sense act would do i reserve the balance of my time"], [4.595518112182617e-05, 0.5000459551811218, 0, "i rise today to ask my colleagues to support my amendment to h r 22 which would allow for states to give ranchers the flexibility they need in transporting livestock by truck today florida is home to more than 1 7 million head of cattle of that there are nearly 1 million head of beef cattle cared for by the 15 000 beef producers across the state nationally florida comes in ninth place in overall cattle numbers in fact the top three ranking counties for cattle in my state are in my backyard okeechobee highlands and osceola counties florida is what is referred to in the cattle industry as a cowcalf operation state this means cows are bred and calved in florida but the calves are then shipped out west for development and processing because of this our cattle ranchers and beef producers rely on the shipping of cattle through the state and across the country in order to succeed unlike most goods shipped by truck or rail livestock needs special attention that is why shipments are carefully organized to consider the needs and welfare of the animals being shipped the livestock industrys goal is to move the cattle between locations safely and as fast as possible to minimize the stress on the animals unfortunately this is where washington regulations get in the way the current gross weight limit restriction for all trucks on federal highways is 80 000 pounds which limits how many cows can be hauled in one load this restriction results in a partially empty livestock trailer increasing the needs for more shipments and ends up putting more trucks on the road the patchwork of state and national truck weight laws creates inefficiencies and forces livestock transporters to take indirect and longer routes for cowcalf operations that rely on shipping their hauls nationwide these constraints reduce the efficiency of their operation and reduce the slim profits for our hardworking ranchers my amendment allows states to issue special permits for the transportation of livestock on trailers for up to 95 000 pounds focusing only on livestock shipping and allowing states to opt in to this program my amendment would greatly benefit not only ranchers but all american producers and consumers this amendment means fewer trucks on the road and lower costs for transporting livestock i encourage my colleagues to support my amendment and take overly restrictive government red tape out of the equation of beef production my amendment is supported by the national cattlemens beef association the oldest and largest national trade association supporting americas cattle producers i encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and make washington work for americas cattle ranchers instead of the other way around i reserve the balance of my time"], [4.8041343688964844e-05, 0.49995195865631104, 1, "i want to thank my friend mr jeffries i visited with the family of walter scott i attended his funeral and not long after the services were over i was approached by two women who identified themselves as mothers of two young men who had suffered unusual and unnecessary brutality at the hands of the officer who perpetrated the unnecessary shooting of walter scott both these women said to me that throughout the north charleston community there is significant apprehension as to whether or not they could accept or expect any kind of relief for the pain that they are suffering i remained in charleston over the weekend on sunday evening i saw that the mayor of north charleston mayor summey the chief of police of north charleston chief driggers along with the sheriff of charleston county attended the healing services that took place at calvary baptist church there in charleston i applaud themthe mayor the chief and the sherifffor responding to these three families and there may be others but in a way that makes us all proud i am hopeful that after this weekend and some subsequent occurrences that congress would take a long hard look at whether or not there is a role for us to play in responding to what seems to be an epidemic i applaud those in the south carolina legislature most especially senator marlon kimpson for his authorship of body camera legislation i thank the various newspapers most recently this morning the state newspaper for endorsing this concept saying that it is something that the legislature in south carolina should authorize and fund now there are a lot of police departments that are too small to raise the necessary funds and a lot of them are so big that the cost might be prohibitive to that i want to say mr jeffries as i thank you congressman scott and congressman richmond as well as congressmen gowdy and labrador for all the work you are doing trying to pull together a piece of comprehensive legislation that will reform our judicial criminal system in a way that would make things much better going forward please i ask take a look at whether or not it is time for us here in the congress to make the funds available so that all local police departments can afford to do something that i think will address a national problem i also believe that the time has come for us to maybe mandate from this level the body cameras i think congresswoman corinne brown and congressman emanuel cleaver have both proposed legislation in this area lets take a look at their legislation hopefully your task force will take a look at their legislation and see whether or not we can incorporate that legislation authorization as well as the funding going forward now i want to thank the attorney general and the fbi director for proposing that we deal with this issue of data collection that is going to be very important as we take a look at these issues and these incidents and to see whether or not it is time for us to do something at the national level to deal with data collection that too is an expense in fact that is something these departments would have a problem with in terms of size where they are so big they cant afford it or too small to raise the funds and maybe we can find a way to help fund the storage of this data so that we can create a better climate now before i close i want to say something that i get beaten up a lot for raising this issue but i feel strongly about it i am not easily intimidated and i refuse to be bullied therefore i want to say once again whoever is funding the activities of the american legislative exchange council they are funding the kind of legislation stand your ground that creates vigilante activity in this country it is clear that is what is formed from that legislation they are also funding legislation that is suppressing voters and when you suppress voters you are in fact ruining activity at the community level that i think is very very important they are also funding the bleaching and stacking of legislative and congressional districts all of which i believe add to the creation of a venomous climate throughout our country i started my professional career as a public school teacher teaching history i have studied the history of our great country and i have taught it i can say that it is clear to me that a lot of the legislation that is being proposed today a lot of the activities that we are experiencing today we went through this before i would ask anybody who may be interested in the subject to just take a look at what occurred in this great country between 1872 and those new constitutions that went in place throughout the south in 1895 you will see that through that 23year period the same kind of vigilante activity all done under the heading of jim crow laws the same activity with a different label is what we are beginning to see today i would hope that all the people here in this congress and around the country will really take stock of who we are where we are and let us do what is necessary to move our country to common ground for all of its great citizenry thank you so much"], [5.054473876953125e-05, 0.49994945526123047, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in strong opposition to the deny women health care act congressional approval ratings are at an alltime low and here is another example of why republicans in congress have failed to fulfill their fundamental responsibility to our great nation again republicans have pushed america to the brink of another government shutdown and we are a mere 5 legislative days away republicans in congress have refused to sit down and negotiate a bipartisan appropriations plan despite the urging of democrats business leaders military servicemembers and citizens all across america the bill brought to the floor today is an attempt by republican leaders to distract the american public from their failure to do their job last spring we urged republicans in congress to sit down and hammer out an appropriations plan they refused instead the congress adjourned at the end of july nothing happened in august nothing has happened since the congress has returned after labor day now the republican dysfunction in this house will have very serious consequences for our neighbors back home a republican shutdown would hurt thousands of disabled veterans disadvantaged children small businesses working families and taxpayers the last time republicans shut down the government for 16 days the economy lost 24 billion and 120 000 private sector jobs here is what happened the republican shutdown stalled veterans disability claims creating additional needless delays for our heroes seeking help hundreds of critically sick americans were prevented from enrolling in the nih clinical trials with 98 percent of the national science foundation nearly threequarters of nih and twothirds of cdc employees furloughed head start grantees serving thousands of children were forced to close american entrepreneurs and small businesses were cut off from millions of dollars in sba loans small businesses with government contracts faced abrupt payment delays and cutbacks almost 4 billion in irs refunds were delayed the republican congress continuing dysfunction and inability to govern are having real impacts on hardworking americans the american people are tired of their relentless failure to govern and the culture of crisis again and again republicans have chosen to put their radical special interest agenda ahead of the priorities of hardworking americans the american people deserve better especially in this case because the deny women health care act is a cynical attack on the ability of women across america to receive the health services that they need at trusted planned parenthood clinics i know many are passionate about these personal issues that is why the republicans advance this bill on this topic they know it is sure to inflame passions but to date despite congressional inquiries into these false videotapes there has been no wrongdoing uncovered whatsoever no evidence to substantiate the allegations what has emerged since the false videos were posted on youtube is a coordinated broadbased smear campaign based upon false manufactured videos that are full of distortions and misinformation the bill is one more assault in the long list of republican assaults on womens health care over the last two decades because simply defunding planned parenthood would leave millions of american women without key preventative services including birth control family planning lifesaving cancer screenings testing and treatment of infections wellwomen exams and advice on family planning i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
