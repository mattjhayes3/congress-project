legislation that we will address today and pay tribute to his bravery and certainly his loss we come to the floor today as partners with many in this congress against voter intimidation and to speak on behalf of the congressional black caucus to collaborate with our many friends across the caucuses and across the interests in the democratic caucus and certainly we hope to include our friends on the other side of the aisle since the 2010 election over 40 states have implemented voter id voter suppression laws we are not against knowing who is voting but we are against turning back the clock of what the voting rights act attempted to do some 40plus years ago when before that time a poll tax was utilized or asking those from the african american community how many jelly beans were in a jar just recently i sent a letter to the unitedstates attorneys office regarding voter intimidation and voter oppression we rise today to say that we will stand against such oppression and ask the justice department to not clear voter id laws i rise today to speak about the need to protect democracy to protect the voice of the american people and to ensure the right to vote continues to be treated as a right under the constitution rather than being treated as privilege i am joined by my colleagues here today to call on all americans of good faith to reject and denounce tactics that have absolutely no place in our democracy we call on africanamericans hispanic and latin americans and asianamerican voters to stand strong and learn their voting rights granted by law and the constitution we call on these citizens to stand against harassment and intimidation to vote in the face of such adversity the most effective way to curb tactics of intimidation and harassment is to vote is to stand together to fight against any measures that would have the effect of preventing every eligible citizen from being able to vote voting ensures active participation in democracy instances of voter intimidation are not long ago and far away just last year i sent a letter to unitedstates attorney general eric holder to draw his attention to several disturbing instances of voter intimidation that had taken place in houston in a single week there were at least 15 reports of abuse of voter rights throughout the city of houston as a senior member of the house judiciary committee i called for an immediate investigation of these instances many of these incidents of voter intimidation were occurring in predominately minority neighborhoods and have been directed at africanamericans and latinos it is unconscionable to think that anyone would deliberately employ the use of such forceful and intimidating tactics to undermine the fundamental constitutional right to vote however such conduct has regrettably occurred in houston and i urge you to take appropriate action to ensure that it does not recur i am here today in the name of freedom patriotism and democracy i am here to demand that the long hardfought right to vote continues to be protected a long bitter and bloody struggle was fought for the voting rights act of 1965 so that all americans could enjoy the right to vote regardless of race ethnicity or national origin americans died in that fight so that others could achieve what they had been forcefully deprived of for centuriesthe ability to walk freely and without fear into the polling place and cast a voting ballot efforts to keep minorities from fully exercising that franchise however continue indeed in the past thirty years we have witnessed a pattern of efforts to intimidate and harass minority voters including efforts that were deemed ballot security programs that include the mailing of threatening notices to africanamerican voters the carrying of video cameras to monitor polls the systematic challenging of minority voters at the polls on unlawful grounds and the hiring of guards and offduty police officers to intimidate and frighten voters at the polls my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a particularly poor track record when it comes to documented acts of voter intimidation in 1982 a federal court in new jersey provided a consent order that forbids the republican national committee from undertaking any ballot security activities in a polling place or election district where race or ethnic composition is a factor in the decision to conduct such activities and where a purpose or significant effect is to deter qualified voters from voting these reprehensible practices continue to plague our nations minority voters"],

of the congress is a respect of the liberties which we want to protect so i would ask my colleagues to yield to transparency to yield to a shorter extension make this bill stand on its own two feet juxtaposed to the constitution while we mourn those who have fallen we respect that this is a free country today we are not acting on that freedom by giving up the congressional oversight that is necessary i ask my colleagues to reject the present form of this bill i beg the senate to look more readily at a shorter extension and more transparency i rise in opposition to the fisa amendments act of 2008 i believe that although we had a chance to discuss this reauthorization in the judiciary committee the full import of this bill is too broad and more debate and consideration is necessary the fact is not lost on me that this is the 11th year following the attacks of 911 i open my statement with a quote from one of my heroines and a trailblazer on so many levels barbara jordan who said what the people want is very simplethey want an america as good as its promise over the past year senate and house democrats have worked with their republican counterparts the administration the intelligence community and privacy advocates to develop proposals for amendments to fisa that would give the intelligence community the flexibility it needs to safeguard our nation while also providing strong protections for civil liberties a proper balancing is americaas good as its promise and inkeeping with the notion of balance i offered an amendment during the judiciary committee markup of this legislation which simply asked for a report on the implementation of the amendments made by the fisa amendments act of 2008 my amendment simply requested that the report include an assessment of the impact of section 702 of the fisa on the privacy of persons inside the united states even with courtapproved targeting and minimization procedures in place the government can and does intercept the communications of unitedstates citizens it does so without a particularized warrant or a showing of probable cause this approach to electronic surveillance raises concerns under the fourth amendment which prohibits unreasonable searches warrantless eavesdropping and the use of general warrants the fourth amendment to the unitedstates constitution provides a right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures many of the government activities discussed in this report have the potential to constitute a search as that term is defined in fourth amendment jurisprudence namely government action constitutes a search when it intrudes upon a persons reasonable expectation of privacy which requires both that an individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the searched object and that society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable the fourth amendment and its protections go back to our foundingthe ability of the american patriots to resist unwarranted searches and seizures by the british is inculcated in the american psyche thus the fourth amendment ultimately limits the governments ability to conduct a range of activities such as physical searches of homes or offices and listening to phone conversations as a general rule the fourth amendment requires the government to demonstrate probable cause and obtain a warrant unless a recognized warrant exception applies before conducting a search this rule applies most clearly in criminal investigations for example an officer conducting a criminal investigation typically may not search a persons belongings without first obtaining a warrant that describes the property for which sufficient evidence justifies a search the extent to which the fourth amendment warrant requirement applies to the governments collection of information for intelligence gathering and other purposes unrelated to criminal investigations is unclear although the surveillance of wire or oral communications for criminal law enforcement purposes was held to be subject to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment in 1967 neither the supreme court nor congress sought to regulate the use of such surveillance for national security purposes at that time several years later the supreme court invalidated warrantless electronic surveillance of domestic organizations for national security purposes but indicated that its conclusion might differ if the electronic surveillance targeted foreign powers or their agents a lower court has since upheld the statutory scheme governing the gathering of foreign intelligence information against a fourth amendment challenge despite an assumption that orders issued pursuant to the statute might not constitute warrants for fourth amendment purposes the supreme court has not yet directly addressed the issue however even if the warrant requirement was found not to apply to searches for foreign intelligence or national security purposes such searches would presumably be subject to the general fourth amendment reasonableness test in the context of national security the contours of the fourth amendment are necessarily narrowed but not abandoned altogether the march toward a big brother state begins when the peoples rights to privacy and to be free from surveillance are surrendered in toto all we have to do is look at the recent jones decision which concerned a purely domestic case in which law enforcement took advantage of hightech tools to follow a suspected drug dealer a conservative roberts court voted 90 to invalidate this search it is rare for liberal democrats and conservative republicans to agree on much of anything these days but i am sure that many of my colleagues on the other side would find untargeted procedures under fisa unlawful and thereby unconstitutional homeland security is not a democratic or a republican issue it is not a house or senate issue it is an issue for all americansall of us need to be secure in our homes secure in our thoughts and secure in our communications it is widely known that the obama administration would like a clean five year reauthorization of the fisa amendments act consistent with the approach taken by the senate select committee on intelligence this spring i would also note that there were two voices of dissent in the senate committees proceedings senators wyden and udall who have been champions of national security privacy and civil libertieswhich are not mutually exclusive"],

columbia in our structure it is an anomalous place and when members come to the house of representatives they must find it very peculiar that anything having to do with a local jurisdiction comes here at all the most important thing to remember as i speak this afternoon is that that anomaly got to be too much for the congress and 39 years ago the congress sent back to the district the power to legislate for the district of columbia so if you hear members say congress can legislate for the district of columbia you must point them to the home rule act of 1973 it is true that on some matters the district cannot legislate for itself those matters involve things like imposing a commuter tax or changing the limits on how high buildings can be in the district because we dont want to obscure the great monuments but i assure you that the enumerated congressional powers over the district are quite small and that none of what i have to say this afternoon is among those areas where congress has said only congress itself should be able to legislate yet my good friends on the other side insist upon imposing their own views on the district of columbia quite undemocratically against our will even if you assumed that congress could enact laws for the district of columbia no one would assume that congress couldwithout any democratic accountabilityenact laws that went counter to the laws the district had enacted where are the smallgovernment tea party members the ones who are trying to teach the house of representatives a lesson about pulling back even from federal matters you cross the line very seriously when you involve yourself in local matters where you yourself cannot be held accountable do you believe in democracy or not it seems to me that the entire notion of passing a law and imposing it on people who have no say about it is a kind of authoritarianism that we ourselves criticize on this floor every single day in one fashion or another twice this week republican members disregarded their own basic principles and sought to interfere with the local government of the district of columbia and its citizens against their will in the most undemocratic fashion there was no respect for democracy no respect for federalism no respect for their own principles they moved forward to say that this was the way we would like it no matter what you would like as you might expect we took exception i am very pleased with the outpouring of support we have received from all over the country regarding the way the district was treated in the attempt by representative trent franks to impose his views on reproductive choice for the women and physicians of the district of columbia and i appreciate the support i have received when many were shocked that i was not granted the courtesy of testifying at his hearing on his bill which affects only my district let me say a word about that bill representative trent franks is from arizona the sponsor of this same bill in the senatea bill to impose a 20week limit on abortions for women in the district of columbiais from at least as far away senator mike lee of utah senator lee had hardly hit the groundi think had filed all of nine bills when he filed a bill that would impose a 20week limit on abortions in the district of columbia not on utah but on the district of columbia representative franks bill wouldnt impose this on arizona its only on the district of columbia there is nobody in this house that would not have taken umbrage at such undemocratic audacity and so we did as for senator mike lee he realized what he was doing wasnt exactly kosher because he introduced the bill and though he is a new memberand every new member puts out a press release about what hes donehe didnt put out a release on this bill so we outed him we put out a release on his bill and then his newspapers began to talk and so then he put out a release i think what i am talking about will be understood when you see how this occurred one thing that most americans have learned to do is respect the differences on very controversial issues and one of the most controversial is abortion an issue that really turns off independents in this country but captures the verve of the right wing to this day even though the right of women to reproductive choice was declared decades ago in roe v wade and of course when they come at women democrats respond under roe v wade a woman is entitled to seek an abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy in fact the supreme court was at pains to say that it would not put a time limit on the number of weeks that thats a matter of viability and a matter between the woman and her physician yet senator mike lee and representative trent franks sought to set the number of weeks on their ownin violation of course of the constitutional mandate in roe v wade what are we supposed to do sit down and take it i asked to testify at the hearing on rep trent franks bill representative trent franks as chairman of the subcommittee denied me the right to testify even though the bill related only to my district he said that it was because the rules say that democrats could have only one witness and that they had chosen a woman whom we had recommended professor christy zink who had an abortion in the district of columbia at 21 weeks on the recommendation of her physicians and her family when the fetus was discovered to be hopelessly deformed of course we would want the committee to hear from such a person and the rules may well be what representative franks says they are but he clearly has no sense of common courtesy or comity of congressional courtesy where as a matter of right any such rule would be waived particularly if the members own district were implicated its bad enough to introduce a bill that has to do with somebody elses district where nobodynot the physicians who are implicated not the women and families who are implicatedcan reach you because they cant vote for you hardly an act of courage if this is so importantand i have to believe it is to themwhy wouldnt senator lee and representative franks introduce a 20week bill for all the nation why does their courage stop at the district line this should be a matter of principle how could you possibly want to stop abortions after 20 weeks only in one district of course representative franks is in the habit of denying me the opportunity to testify when his subcommittee considers bills that affect only my district he considered a bill that passed here in the house but was stopped in the senate that would have permanently kept the district of columbia alone from spending its own local taxpayer funds on abortions for lowincome women what in the world does a member from arizona have to do with how we in the district of columbia spend money that he had nothing to do with raising having been denied the right to testify on that bill no wonder i was denied again yesterday except this time it went viral and all over the united states they are talking about how a member introduces a bill relating to another members district and she doesnt even get a waiver so that she can say something on behalf of her own constituents on the bill he has introduced which will only affect those constituents and not his own and im supposed to like it well i dont like it and im not going to sit still for it i went to the hearing yesterday and everyone was polite representative franks invited me to sit on the allmale member panel but without being able to speak to hear about how women in the district of columbia should have their right to reproductive choice cut off by him i didnt give him the opportunity for that optic to have me on the panel unable to say anything invite the member from the district to sit on the panel to integrate it so that there is at least one woman and tell her to keep her mouth shut while they talk about her district hear from one of her constituents and talk about denying the women and families in her district what women and families are entitled to everywhere in the united states no sir thank you what i want is the same rights everybody else has i grew up as a secondclass citizen in this town twice oversecond class because we didnt have a member of congress until the 1970s and second class because i was an african american and therefore as a child had to go to segregated schools and im not going to have my constituents now that i am a member of congress treated any differently from the way representative trent franks constituents are treated or senator mike lees constituents are treated we are free and equal americans we pay federal income taxes just like everybody else and yet we have no vote on the house floor the nerve of members introducing a bill that they expect to go to the house floor and i would not even be able to vote on the bill and yet it would apply only to my constituents where is the sense of decency there is none i dont know about a war on women but when you keep coming at the district of columbia women thats a war on them and if you want to declare war im here to do the best i can to fight back first it was our lowincome women by barring d c from spending its local funds on abortions they have succeeded in getting that rider reembedded in our local budget now they want to do that on a permanent basis and now they want to go to a 20week limit and no womanlowincome highincomeno woman in the district of columbia could get an abortion and our physicians who care for women from all over this region and all over the country who found what professor zinks physician found which is that she should not carry that fetus to full term would have to somehow ask her to find someone outside of the district of columbia to perform an abortion under such tragic circumstances a woman who had a child and wanted another child who would put somebody through that it is an insatiable hunger that the smallgovernment tea party republicans are showing for interfering with the democratic rights of the people i represent and im going to call them out youre not going to get away with doing it in private youre not going to get away with not having me testify were going to shout it to the hilltops that all you talk aboutsmall government and that the federal government should get out of everybodys livesand now youre hopping over those principles into the lives of 600 000 americans who you are not accountable to after the congress said in 1973 that governing for the district of columbia now 1973 belongs to the mayor and the council of the district of columbia only no were not going to stand for it youre going to hear from us the bill is patently unconstitutional these very courageous republicans gotten it passed in seven conservative states they want a federal imprimatur on this bill so they say lets get the district of columbia what kind of courage do they lack do you believe in it introduce it introduce it for the women of america what are you afraid of wheres your spine do you only have a spine when it comes to 600 000 people who have a representative who you continue to disempower by denying her a vote on the house floor including a vote on her own appropriation and a vote on the very bill that youve introduced to take away rights guaranteed under the constitution that her citizens are entitled to the bill is patently unconstitutional roe v wade indicates that women are entitled to abortion care until viability but do you know what else the bill is its a violation of our 14th amendment right because you are treating our women and our physicians differently than women and physicians are treated elsewhere in the united states dont come at us with unequal protection and expect the people i represent to say okay mr congressman just do whatever you like keep doing it and we will keep calling you out we will never let you get away with a costfree undemocratic intrusion into our lives last night here comes representative phil gingrey with a resolution nonbinding saying that active duty military personnel in the district of columbia on personal time should not have to abide by the gun laws of the district of columbia here we go again with our gun laws we have stricer gun laws than some so be it some states have strict gun laws too are we less american than others that enact their own laws at whose altar am i supposed to kneel who are my constituents supposed to bow down to nobody in this house or senate well i opposed that resolution because if representative gingrey of georgia thinks that active duty military personnel in their private capacities should not have to obey the gun laws in d c then he ought to wank it for every state in the union youre not going to put on us bills for the district of columbia that clearly have nationwide import in order to make your ideological points in a cheap and cynical way because thats what it is its on the cheap its a defiance of democracy and it expects us to just let it go on the contrary it gets our dander up to be treated as less than full american citizens it gets our dander up sure the resolution passed it was nonbinding but the fact is that if you want to do a nonbinding resolution that says that gun laws shouldnt be applicable to active duty personnel in their personal capacities there is no possible reason to limit that to one jurisdiction we will not have it we are not vehicles pawns or instruments to be used at will we are fullfledged american citizens who fought and died in every american war including the war that created the united states of america we are the only taxpaying citizens of the united states of america who have no voting representation in this house and none at all in the senate get off of your high undemocratic horses its bad enough that you allowed that kind of a situation to go on for 200 years but when you pile on and want to enact legislation that you dont have the nerve or the guts to enact for the entire country but do such bills only for the district of columbia expect the district of columbia to come back at you we may be only one jurisdiction but we will never allow ourselves and our citizenship to be degraded and we will not allow ourselves to be demeaned as the frankslee bill did and as the gingrey bill did go home and make your own constituents understand why you are legislating for somebody elses district and you tell me whether your tea party friends will say well done i doubt it this was a week when twice in the same week republicans tried to roll over the district of columbia once was too much twice i simply could not abide so i issue fair warning its only me here i cant hurt anybody i cant even vote against you but i can tell you this much im not going to allow the unequal treatment of the taxpaying citizens i represent to go unaddressed ever not for one single moment i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.16173303127288818,

say to you dont bother to take notes no need to call the family to see history being made here just move along theres nothing happening here weve got this plan that doesnt come anywhere close to being a solution to the fiscal cliff its a political gimmick and all of us recognize that it has no chance whatsoever of becoming law the process that has brought us here has been equally shameful more befitting a developing country than the greatest democracy on earth it has been absolutely painful to watch the otherwise responsible members of the majority play their assigned roles pretending that what we did last night was normal and legitimate last night we saw one of the greatest miscarriages of the democratic process in my time on the rules committee facing the impending fiscal cliff that could devastate our economy and harm millions of americans the majority decided to cobble together lastminute legislation on a wing and a prayer last night the rules committee spent most of the evening debating legislation that weve barely seen we were told that there would be two bills two bills actually were filed at midnight on tuesday one of them disappeared and in the waning hours even while the debate on the rule was taking place a third was dropped into our laps it turned out to be a warmedover bill that went through the house of representatives in may destroying health care food stamps and almost every other possibility of people in the country to survive thats how the majority wants to solve the greatest economic threat facing our nation with nothing less than millions of jobs on the line does the majority really believe that passing a bill in less than 24 hours that will do absolutely nothing is responsible governing today were prepared to vote on this legislation and i think possibly adjourn for the final time this year if this is the majoritys final attempt to reach a compromise then our nation does indeed face frightening times if no compromise is reached we may face the greatest displacement of workers since 1929 as sequestration takes effect and forces countless layoffs how devastating is that to a recovering economy every american knows we cannot let this happen and frankly i believe that every member of congress knows that we never would let it happen but after last night im not so sure this is not a serious solution to avoid economic catastrophe its just one last attack on the poor and the middle class right before we tumble off together over the fiscal cliff todays bill contains many dangerous provisions i mentioned part c that we got last night the old warmedover bill providing an average tax cut of 50 000 for millionaires and billionaires meanwhile the 25 million working families would pay an average of 1 000 more on taxes 11 million families would lose a tax credit that helps to pay for college drastic cuts would be made to medicare and the important provisions of the affordable care act would be no more they simply could not adjourn this year without one last attempt to destroy the health care bill that will provide health care for millions more americans many covered by insurance that they have never been able to have before during my last election which occurred last month i met more than one person who told me that they had been bornthere is one person who sticks out in my mindshe had been born with cerebral palsy she told me that her whole life while she brought up a family lived her life driving a car cooking moving everything that we all do and take for granted in life she had to do without any health insurance because having been born with cerebral palsy she had a preexisting condition that prevented it it was not until she was 65 and was able to get medicare did she have the peace of mind that most of us take for granted that she was eligible to be covered why in the world do we keep trying to be the only industrial country that does not take better care of its people than that finally 2 million americans would lose their unemployment assistance right here at the holiday time as i said before the nutrition assistance program would be gutted those unjust cuts would leave millions struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table the americans that were talking about those that will be suffering are not the ones that caused the problem in this country they had nothing to do with financial services and the shenanigans that were played that brought us to our knees yet continually this house asks them through the majority side to pay the price enough already theyre not to blame and they should not be put on the block sadly just days agotuesday in factit appeared that president obama and speaker boehner were close to a fiscal cliff compromise president obama had made concessions some that frankly as i pointed out our side is not that crazy about but in the blink of an eye the house majority decided to walk away in 51 seconds announcing what they were going to do in a takeitorleaveit manner and introduce this political hoax that is before us today dont anybody be fooled the american people know better they see through this they know that a compromise means that we must meet in the middle unfortunately the majority continues to think if they pass extreme legislation and then run for the hills the rest of us will be forced to give in weve seen similar antics from the majority throughout the 112th congressfrom holding the full faith and credit of this nation hostage for the first time in its history and losing our credit rating to voting 33 times to repeal health care reform the majority has continually advanced a cynical and partisan agenda at the expense of our nations welfare given this there is little surprise that the approval rating for congress is at an alltime low and that historians have said it is the least productive congress in our history in the election just last month the american people made their voices heard when asked to choose between an extreme agenda that took care of the millionaires and billionaires at their expense they said no in that they wanted not to be going over a fiscal cliff and they have made that very clear i think of what we have done to just the economic future of this country by debating this fiscal cliff as long as we have but i dont believe as i said that we will actually go over it except im not really clear on what were doing here today unless that is to cut and run yet in the process the majority has presided over a shameful legislative circus not worthy of this institution when our nation is in desperate need of serious solutions the majority is doing everything in its power to avoid finding the answers i strongly oppose this hoax before us i urge my colleagues on both sides of

california and each of the other speakers here for the contribution they have made tonight and particularly when i listened to my colleague from tennessee talk about those particular cases of individuals that were impacted because thats really what this is all about again it is amazing to me that the first act of this new republican majority is to try to repeal a bill health care reform that really is making a difference for people on a personal level particularly with the patient protections you know i thought to myself when i was coming down here who benefits from repeal who could possibly benefit from repeal because as many of you talked about all the people who are going to be harmed by it who would benefit from it and the only group i could think of that would benefit from the repeal are the big insurance companies because if you think about it what do they want to do they want to keep increasing premiums i read that in your statei dont know you may have already mentioned itblue cross blue shield whatever is talking about a 50something percent increase i cannot fathom these doubledigit increases and of course as this health care reform kicks in its going to be more and more difficult for the types of increases that weve seen in premiums that these big health insurance companies have put forward and the reason the insurance companies want to get rid of the patients bill of rights and reinstitute all of these discriminatory practices whether it be denying care because of preexisting conditions or reinstituting lifetime caps or you know the different protections that weve seen kick in the reason they want to do that is also moneyoriented in other words they have to pay out money you talked about the cancer person i was up at the rules committee earlier and ms slaughter was talking about someone who had cancer and was treated and ran into the lifetime cap and then the cancer reoccurred and she didnt have any more coverage because she had hit the lifetime cap and thats a perfect example they want to have lifetime caps they want to have annual caps they dont want preexisting conditions they dont want your kids on your policy because it saves them money the way that they make profits and pay dividends to their shareholders is by raising premiums and having discriminatory practices that eliminate the people that cost money because they need health care i mean its that simple and already and just in the last few weeks provisions have kicked in that go against that the president announcedor the white house announced i think around christmastime new regulations that say that any premium increase thats over 10 percent will be scrutinized and under the provisions of this bill and the new regulations these increases are not allowed to go above 10 percent on january 1 the provisions kicked in that said that 80 percent of your premium costs had to be used for benefits couldnt be used for insurance company profits couldnt be used to pay back dividends to the shareholders so all of these initiatives that are already kicking in they basically make it more difficult for the insurance companies to make a big profit and the consequence of that is that health insurance becomes more affordable i was up at the rules committee earlier it was interesting because i think you mentioned my colleague from california or one of you mentioned that we under this bill under the health care reform thats in place now that they want to repeal we get the same health insurance as congressmen as any other american you know i still have people write to me and say well you know you have your own policy but you want to give me this lousy coverage that im going to get under the health care reform and i have to write back and say no thats not true you may hear that on some tv station or something but its simply not true we specifically wrote into the bill that we have to go into the exchanges just like everybody else we are going to be different from other federal employees as congressmen because we go into the exchanges so at the rules committee today one of the republican members who is very supportive of repeal said that he specifically wasnt going to take health insurance as a congressman and he wanted me to know that because he was voting for repeal and i said well thats very nice and thats commendable for you but i frankly think that every member of congress who votes for repeal should say i dont want health insurance from the federal government because if you are going to deny it to everyone else you should deny it to yourself just the way were saying that we are going to get the same coverage as everyone else well if you dont want anyone else to have the coverage then you shouldnt get it yourself and i know that some members have already taken issue there was one member from maryland who came to the orientation a republican member from maryland who apparently was a big advocate for repeal and he said that he was inquiring because his federal health insurance didnt take effect as a congressman until february 1 we were sworn in yesterday but i guess it takes 30 days before the insurance actually kicks in he was complaining about the fact that had he to wait until february 1 to get his health insurance as a congressman well you know again if youre going to vote for repeal next week you shouldnt be worried about when its going to kick in you shouldnt be taking it at all in my opinion so there is a lot ofi dont know what the phrase issmoke and mirrors or whatever the word is that is going on around here on the other side of the aisle in how they are viewing this and my point is you know there is a lot of protection here for people dont deny them that unless youre going to deny it to yourself but more than that think about who is helped by this repealonly the big insurance companies they are the only ones that are going to benefit i know you were the insurance commissioner

emergency meeting now what would be an emergency in the united states the cost of the war the damage of the war unemployment figures the deficit home foreclosure the tragedy in japan a nofly zone over libya no the emergency is that they want to destroy national public radio this is the latest in a long string of misplaced priorities by the republican party it does nothing to fix the longterm fiscal condition it doesnt create a single job in fact it will lose some the congressional budget office has determined that the legislation does absolutely zero to reduce the deficit when so many americans want our representatives to create jobs to responsibly reduce the deficit and to bring our sons and daughters home from the battlefields overseas why are we wasting valuable floor time on an ideological battle that does nothing to achieve any of those goals because the bill is a political stunt it is being rushed through congress under draconian rules violating their own promises of transparency the republican majority held no hearings no committee action of any kind listened to no expert testimony and provided no chance for the american people to weigh in just by saying it is an emergency apparently in many minds it does become one by not providing a true 72 hours and because the bill itself omitted the fact that the bill would lay over to allow all members to review the legislation they violated the spirit of the transparency they promised the american people just 5 months ago my colleagues on the other side know that they must pass this legislation quickly before the american people at the rate of 69 percent are allowed to speak and tell their representatives something they dont want to hear for the american people unlike the far rightwing know that npr is not an ideological news outlet and that npr radio bases its reporting on fact which is really an anomaly today in the united states npr doesnt try to blur the line between opinion fact and political agenda instead it takes the time and spends the money to do indepth reporting across the country and around the globe and to go where no other news organization will go unlike commercial news outlets that are driven by the need to garner ratings and sell commercial advertising national public radio concerns itself first and foremost with informing the nation on the complex issues that face our country in stark contrast to the bare bones and often sensationalist reporting found elsewhere national public radio operates 17 foreign bureaus in fact it is one of the few news outlets to maintain a fulltime bureau in afghanistan reporting from the front lines of a largely forgotten war it is also in the process of opening a bureau in turkey in order to report firsthand on the democratic uprisings throughout the middle east in the united states it has correspondents spread out from texas to oregon telling the stories not covered by the cable news pundits that we see on tv every day in rural america in particular npr can often be the only best source of news defunding npr will cut off this valuable source of news from the southern tier of western new york to the plains of the upper midwest and will put rural communities at a major disadvantage in the information age it is because of their valuable and unique reporting that americans are increasingly turning to npr in order to learn about our everchanging world in fact despite the challenges facing the news media a new report by the pew foundation has shown that npr is strong and is growing more popular every day according to the report nprs audience has grown to 27 2 million weekly listeners this is a 58 percent increase since the year 2000 in addition the web site is a premier online news destination garnering 15 7 million visitors a month which is an increase of more than 5 million people over the course of a single yearand are those people really going to be angry ive been a proud supporter of npr my whole life in public service while serving in the new york state legislature i fought for the launch of news programming on my local public radio station wxxi from that humble beginning over 30 years ago i find myself standing on the floor of the house of representatives fighting for npr again today i stand here because quite simply facts matter this nation wasnt built because we huffed and puffed and wished it were so we didnt become a global leader by bloviating on 24hour cable news and we arent solving the fundamental issues that face our nation by passing this politically driven legislation to appease the far right our nation was built and will be rebuilt by the quiet efforts of millions of americans across the country who will never make it on cable news and who will never appear on national television it is these very americans whom npr dedicates its resources to finding to covering and to sharing the world with their stories arent simple and their efforts dont sell advertising space but their stories matter nprs work to find the stories that matter is the indepth intelligent reporting that i fight for today no matter what i say some will still believe that npr isnt worth funding because they want it to be true some will find it in their interests to scare americans into believing in an npr straw man while others will take comfort in watching the straw man fall yet deep in our hearts all of us know that governing through fear and divisive legislation is not a responsible way to move this country forward it is certainly no replacement for creating jobs with millions of americans who are unemployed and struggling to live we cant waste another minute on the house floor without debating a bill that will put some americans back to work we should not waste another minute ignoring the needs of millions of americans while playing cheap political games yesterday i asked why only national public radio why not television i think i know the answer to that a few years ago that was tried the house of representatives actually tried to kill big bird to destroy elmo and to get rid of bert and ernie but it didnt work i think they didnt want to try that one yet again the backers of this bill said to me yesterday that taxpayers shouldnt have to fund with their hardearned money what they dont believe in well thats an interesting theory but democracies dont operate that way if they could my husband and i and twothirds of the people in america would gladly be excused from paying the 8 billion a month that we pay for a war which we profoundly do not believe in we simply must stop this nonsense it makes us look ridiculous in the eyes of the world national public radio is something that you could turn off if you dont want to hear it but for the

new barriers that could prevent them from voting the number of states with laws requiring voters to show governmentissued photo identification has quadrupled it has quadrupled in the last 4 years

identification under the guise of eliminating voter fraud 21 million american citizens or 11 percent of americans could be prevented from votingall because they do not possess government issued photo identification republicans are also seeking to put an end to early votinga hugely popular voting method that is used by millions of americans at least nine states have introduced bills to reduce their early voting periods four states have tried to reduce absentee voting opportunities and two states have reversed early reforms once again it has disenfranchised thousands of taxpaying citizens who have past criminal convictions while a number of other states have made it much more difficult for citizens to register to vote these new restrictions will undoubtedly disenfranchise young voters

the congressional budget office other independent experts it is not going to reduce the cost of health care in fact it is going to increase the cost of health care in america but what it does is it is going to put an everincreasing burden on elderly americans it is going to have a gap because ultimately they are not going to enable people to have medicare until they are 67 they are going to have a small voucher that is given to the insurance company bear in mind the reason that lbj and the democratic congress in 1965 enacted medicare was because americas elderly could not get good insurance

happens to the 78 million geezer baby boomers who are 55 or older who will be under medicare thats going to continue for years its going to be increasingly inefficient it appears as though there are some extra costs that are embedded for existing and soontobe future medicare recipients that are going to continue to distort drive up costs and of course nationally were all going to pay more for the

for themselves and for their children the original feminists were indeed against abortion these women believed that there was power in motherhood and in choosing life alice paul the author of the original equal rights amendment said it best abortion is the exploitation of women it is this exploitation by groups like planned parenthood that frighten me for the women of our country it has been proven that a woman who has had an abortion is six to seven times more likely to commit suicide in the following year than a woman who chooses to deliver her child we all know of the syndrome postpartum depression women who abort are 65 percent more likely than women who deliver to be at risk for longterm clinical depression sixtyfive percent of unitedstates women who had abortions experienced multiple symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder which they attributed to their abortions in another study 60 percent said they felt part of me died compared to women who deliver women who abort are more than twice as likely to be subsequently hospitalized for psychiatric illnesses within 6 months and to subsequently require significantly more treatments for the psychiatric illnesses through outpatient care there are also numerous health risks that can occur after an abortion is performed reproductive complications and problems with subsequent deliveries can occur one of these being pelvic inflammatory disease which is a major direct cause of infertility after an abortion there is a 7 to 15fold increase in placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies which is a lifethreatening condition for the mother and baby that increases the risk of birth defects a still birth and excessive bleeding leading to the possible loss of life of the woman honestly i could go on and on about the aftereffects of an abortion but i think that the picture has been made quite clear the picture has been made as susan b anthony said who believed it was not sufficient merely to denounce abortion anthony considered it the work of women to prevent this violation this is the task that susan b anthony gives us to continue today like anthony we too must challenge the status quo
