protection agency whose programs protect wildlife the environment and public health continues to hang in the balance this rule first provides for consideration of h r 2898 the western water and american food security act of 2015 which republicans claim will alleviate the drought crisis currently unfolding in california and other western states but this bill is just another example of the countless partisan attempts made by the majority to roll back important environmental protections while also preempting state laws let me put a footnote right there preempting state laws these are the people that argue state rights and now would preempt them in western portions of our great country particularly california reducing water management flexibility this bill undercuts the endangered species act by changing the welldefined standard used to determine when an action negatively affects an endangered species and introduces an untested undefined standard as evidenced by this piece of legislation the republicans solution to the drought crisis is to provide handouts to big agricultural interests at the expense of the environment and everyone else i want to make it very clear that i represent agricultural interests as do my colleagues who are republicans we represent all of the specialty crops and sugarcane grown and we understand these dynamics very well not only will this bill scale back desperately needed environmental protections it will affect thousands of fishing jobs in california and oregon that local residents depend on given the changing standard of the endangered

another this bill will elevate the water rights for certain agricultural contractors over the existing water rights that benefit refuges and wildlife areas in short this bill circumvents californias groundbreaking equitable water conservation programs and puts the desires of big agriculture over everyone else this combined rule also provides for the consideration of h r 3038 termed the highway and transportation funding act of 2015 part ii because it is yet another shortterm temporary patch to ensure that the highway trust fund does not become insolvent it is a patch it is the ninth time we are patching if you had a tire and were riding down a highway and if every time you looked up you had to have another patch pretty soon you would recognize that you would need new tires what we need

next 6 months we will be able to work together to do the things necessary for a 6year highway bill i am paraphrasing what he said as we had in may today we have a rapidly approaching selfimposed

the homeland in honoring his memory we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community we must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats it was congressman lou stokes who taught us that our nation deserves nothing less today we also honor an american treasure

rights movement in selma alabama she is often remembered for her critical role in bloody sunday on that solemn day on the edmund pettus bridge robinson was savagely beaten a photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in the new york times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote yet this tireless fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all americans amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement and it was her courage along with john lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill the voting rights bill were drafted on her kitchen table in selma alabama in 1965 ms boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate she put her money where her mouth was and she herself ran for congress on may 5 1964 amelia boynton broke yet another barrier when she became the first woman in the state of alabama and the first african american woman in the state of alabama to run for congress in 1964 she garnered 10 7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote actually only 1 percent of the registered voters were african americans at that time her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in alabama and in this nation without her courageous campaign for the seventh congressional district of alabama in 1964 i know that my election to this seat in 2010 some 50 years later would not have been possible her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the halls of congress and i will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day for i get to do what she could not and that is vote on behalf of the members of the seventh congressional district of alabama for that i am eternally grateful in fact one of my most memorable moments in this chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the state of the union on january 20 2015 this past year i am grateful

courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life but he is most remembered for his service as the naacp chairman and the cofounder of the southern poverty law center he was also one of the original leaders of the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc while he was a student at morehouse college he later served in the georgia general assembly for more than 20 years he was first elected to the georgia house of representatives in 1965 however because of his longstanding legacy of fighting white supremacy white statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat this brave spirit was undeterred he spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of blacks in the state of georgia in addition to his time as an eloquent speaker he was a celebrated writer poet television commentator community advocate as well as a communication specialist he did so much for the southern poverty law center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many all three of these wonderful giants tell a story a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things working collectively we as a nation can achieve

this special order i want to thank my good friend mr fincher for his work on the legislation and i thank those who are really talking about trying to create jobs really what we are talking about here is in terms of the exim bank the exportimport bankit is a bipartisan piece of legislation that we are looking to reauthorize we are looking to make sure that again we are creating jobs as for the reauthorization of the bank for those who might have forgotten and for those who may be tuned in in 2012 the reauthorization passed on a suspension vote of 33093 it passed in the senate 7820 this was not three decades ago this was 3 years ago there is a reason to support the reauthorization of the exim bank and i appreciate my good friend mr collins for talking about how exim equals jobs i do believe that is the case you have all heard the statistics i mean 83 percent of the loans nationwide from the exim bank are going to small businesses small businesses create twothirds of the net new jobs in our nation i have to tell you in talking to my colleagues around this very body the number one issue that we encounter is the fact that it is jobs and the economy we want to create and make sure that there is a robust number of good highpaying careers the exim bank enables those small businesses to be able to keep their doors open to be able to ship to 96 percent of the worlds consumers which happen to be outside of the united states it is interesting to me when we talk about this because there are a lot of big businesses out there that have the ability and the resources to put a plant over in places like malaysia or germany or those other places it is the small businesses that oftentimes dont have that ability you heard me having a conversation with mr collins earlier about someone who came into my office who was talking about the fact that he manufactures tractors the tractors arent big tractors they are fairly small tractors but the tractors cost about 1 million apiece if they arent able to manufacture those tractors here in the united states in getting that exportimport bank financing they will go somewhere else they have a facility in france that they will be able to use those are jobs that are going to leave the united states i do believe that when we talk about the economic growth in manufacturing my district and i know many of the other districts of my colleagues here are heavy in manufacturing we are the fourth largest manufacturing district in the 10th district of illinois we have literally hundreds of jobs54 000in the district that rely upon exports i recognize that there are a lot of people who want to talk about boeing but boeing actually has three dozen suppliers in the 10th district of illinois these are three dozen businesses and hundreds of employees who support making things that go into a boeing plane you have heard the adage that when a boeing plane lands 21 000 small businesses land with it this is important this is talking about good highpaying jobs things that the exportimport bank absolutely helps support the thing that is interesting to me is that if we choose to not reauthorize the exportimport bank who loses our competitors overseas have export financing our small businesses will be the ones that lose we are going to in essence tie one hand behind our back and make us less competitive i cant think of a crazier thing that of making us less competitive we want to be more competitive we want to give our small businesses every advantage possible to be able to go out and compete and win this is what we have an obligation to do this is what we have an opportunity to do i am delighted to be able to stand up here with my friends to talk in a bipartisan way actually about why it is important that we reauthorize the exportimport bank it is because there are jobs and there are businesses in vernon hills in wheeling in lincolnshire in northbrook in waukegan in glenview in des plaines in gurnee in elmhurst in lake villa in bannockburn and in mount prospect these are all towns in the 10th district that have companies that utilize the exportimport bank this is not some random deal this is something that small businesses utilize in order to make sure that they can sell their goods to places all over the globe to places like france germany india and china it is super important that we give them the opportunity to not only make it here in america but to be able to send it all over the globe if we are looking for an opportunity to end a government program listen i am all for government accountability and for trying to make sure that the government is smaller and more responsive lets not focus on a government program that brings billions of dollars into the federal treasury and creates jobs we have heard about the crony capitalism frankly i think that we need to be focusing on how we help small businesses because again if we shut down the exportimport bank who loses it is our small businesses not the small businesses that they compete against that may be overseas because they will have an export financing arm as my friend mr collins was talking about before if the private sector and the private sector banks would do it i understand but there are a lot of those private sector banks and a lot of those local community banks even those midsized banks that see the collateral go overseas that they cant touch and that they cant get back when they walk in for 1 million of financing to send that tractor overseas the answer is no guess what they cant hire that next individual to create and make that tractor we need export financing we need to make sure that the exportimport bank has some restructuring this bill does some of that in terms of the bill that we are looking for to try to have some changes that go into the exportimport bank to make sure that we are having that appropriate oversight to make sure that we are holding them accountable but it is absolutely vital for good highpaying careers that the exportimport bank is reauthorized and reauthorized with an overwhelming support if it comes to the floor i am confident that this passes i

staff who played an instrumental role in helping us to get to this very point the good faith talks held between my office the majority and the minority committee staff and mr hudsons office have resulted in this bipartisan jobs bill that will go a long way in helping to get our nations economy back on track and working for everyone this workforce bill before us provides an example of how congress should function and how congress should work on behalf of the american people here we have bipartisan members of the energy and commerce committee who represent various constituencies from diverse regions of the country and who come from different political persuasions however it must be well noted that we were able to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on bringing forth a jobs bill that will benefit all of our nations communities and help lift up the entire american economy and exactly what does this bill do mr speaker this bill directs the secretary of energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups including minorities women veterans as well as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in these same related fields this bill will strengthen and more fully engage doe programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the departments workforce development initiatives that includes the minorities in energy initiative that was established 2 years ago with my encouragement under secretary monizs leadership there will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy and manufacturingrelated jobs state by state and region by region all across our nation this bill will help increase outreach to minorityserving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at doe are made available to these worthy establishments it will also provide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities for these candidates to find employment this legislation will help to develop a skilled labor force trained to work in a wide array of sectors including renewables energy efficiency oil and gas coal nuclear utility pipelines alternative fuels as well as energyintensive and advanced manufacturing industries one of the challenges that i have heard far too many times from my constituents is of individuals participating in training programs that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a job with that in mind this bill will help industry help schools and help communitybased workforce development organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are immediately transferable to goodpaying jobs and goodpaying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally nationally and indeed all across this globe as you well know and as all members in this house know the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally the potential of these two sectors can help bolster the american economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status all across the developing world it is important that we equip our citizens those who need jobs and those who are out of work with the skills needed and necessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities this very bill before us today will accomplish that goal why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary just last week my office had yet another visiting delegation a meeting this time with an energy company out of the great state of north carolina whose representatives informed me that right now today as we stand here in this great chamber today they have over 1 000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find enough qualified skilled workers the 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a solution to that and many other similar problems all across our country in fact my office has been holding many of these same types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of different energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing this very same predicament at a time when african american and latino unemployment rates are still too high when coal workers throughout appalachia and beyond are finding themselves without work when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families and when veterans returning home from defending our nation still cannot find a job it is a travesty and a shame that eager employers still cannot find the trained workers they need this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match up trained qualified candidates with goodpaying jobs and careers that will fit them and their families help lift up their community help strengthen the energy and manufacturing industry and will bolster the entire american economy as a whole whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an hbcu or a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community college this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those individuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve the financial situation for their families when this bill becomes law and its provisions are implemented it will help outofwork coal miners retool and retrain for the jobs of the 21st century this bill will also help returning veterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and provide a dignified future for their families so again i want to thank my distinguished colleague from the great state of michigan chairman upton my friend from the great state of

back from a man who was born in eritrea named abdurahman alamoudi and this is from discoverthenetworks org he mr alamoudi immigrated to the united states in 1979 that would be the same year you will recall that radical islam declared war on the united states attacked our embassy in tehran took over 50 americans hostage and held them for over a year that same year that year 1979 is the year mr alamoudi came to the united states and then he became a naturalized unitedstates citizen in 1996 in 1981 he founded the islamic society of boston it is not in this article but i have also seen the documentation of his founding and it is i think worth noting that the islamic society of boston that mr alamoudi founded the two mosques in the boston area one of which produced the tsarnaev brothers where they worshipped and learned more about islam this article says from 1985 to 1990 mr alamoudi served as executive assistant to the president of the saar foundation in northern virginia in 1990 alamoudi founded the american muslim council the following year he established the american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council whose purpose was to certify muslim chaplains hired by the military during the 1992 presidential election cycle alamoudi courted both the democratic and the republican parties when bill clinton emerged victorious alamoudi increased his donations to democrats he went on to serve the clinton administration as an islamic affairs adviser and a state department goodwill ambassador to muslim nations in 1993 the defense department certified alamoudis american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council as one of two organizations along with the graduate school of islamic and social sciences authorized to approve and endorse muslim chaplains among the chaplains endorsed by alamoudis group was james yee who eventually would be arrested in 2003 on suspicion of espionage it is very reassuring that this man arrested on suspicion of espionage here in the united states was certified by mr alamoudis group in march 1993 alamoudi disparaged the federal government for the flimsy evidence it had used as a basis for arresting mohammed salameh a suspect in the world trade center bombing of february 26 of 1993 salameh was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison on what apparently mr alamoudi thought was flimsy evidence it goes on in 1995 alamoudi helped president clinton interesting verb that helped alamoudi helped president clinton and the american civil liberties union develop a presidential guideline entitled religious expression in public school which established a legal justification upon which the aclu would file lawsuits restricting christmas celebrations and removing nativity scenes from public schools alamoudi made numerous controversial statements during the 1990s and early 2000s including these in 1994 he said hamas is not a terrorist group i have followed the good work of hamas in march 1996 alamoudi said he was honored to be a member of the committee that is defending islamic association of palestine or iap founder musa abu marzuk who in 1997 would be deported from the united states because of his hamasrelated activities i really consider him to be from among the best people in the islamic movement that is a quote from alamoudi alamoudi added hamas and i work together with him in december of 1996 as alamoudi continued to work with the clinton administration to find good muslims to work in the government alamoudi told a meeting of the iap i think if we were outside this country we can say oh allah destroy america but once we are here our mission in this country is to change it you can be violent anywhere else but in america in october 2000 alamoudi attended an antiisrael protest outside the white house where he proudly declared himself a supporter of hamas and a supporter of hezbollah and apparently there is video of that in 2000 alamoudi literally began making regular trips to libya where he met with government officials to discuss strategies by which they could create headaches for saudi arabia in january 2001 alamoudi attended a conference in beirut with leaders of numerous terrorist organizations including al qaeda hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad in june 2001 alamoudi was a guest speaker at a northern virginia conference where senior islamic militants from throughout the middle east were gathered many of the speakers denounced the zionist entity that aims to destroy the muslim ummah or community that same month alamoudi attended a briefing on president bushs faithbased initiative and the white house invited him to the post9 11 prayer service on september 14th at the national cathedral in washington in september 2003 british customs officials arrested alamoudi at heathrow airport as he was returning from libya with 340 000 in cash given to him by president muammar qadhafi to finance a plot involving two u k based al qaeda operatives intending to assassinate saudi crown prince later king abdullah alamoudi was subsequently extradited to the united states in october 2003 he was arrested at dulles airport on charges of having illegally accepted 10 700 from the libyan mission to the united nations with alamoudi in custody federal authorities released a transcript of a telephone conversation in which he had lamented that no americans had died during al qaedas 1998 bombing of the unitedstates embassy in kenya recommended that more operations be conducted like the 1994 hezbollah bombing of a jewish cultural center in buenos aires in which 85 people died and clearly articulated his objective of turning america into a muslim nation alamoudi was indicted not only for his illegal dealings with libya but also for tax evasion and immigration fraud he ultimately pled guilty to and was convicted of being a senior al qaeda financier who had funneled at least 1 million into the coffers of that terrorist organization he also acknowledged that he had pocketed almost 1 million for himself in the process in october 2004 alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in federal prison during the holy land foundation for relief and development trial of 2007 which examined evidence of the hlfs fundraising on behalf of hamas the unitedstates government released a list of approximately 300 of hlfs unindicted coconspirators and joint venturers alamoudi was named in that list in addition to the affiliations listed above alamoudi has also been at various times a board member of american muslims for jerusalem the head of the american task force for bosnia a board member of the council for the national interest foundation a director of the council on americanislamic relations cair which by the way has very open access to the highest officials including the president they are the ones that got langley to call off a 2day seminar for law enforcement on radical islam and got the rules changed so people that were american experts on islam could not talk to any unitedstates government group about radical islam unless they got approval from people like those that cair approved of cairwe are talking also about a named coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial in which convictions were obtained for principals in the holy land foundation for supporting terrorism i would humbly submit that had eric holder not become attorney general and barack obama not become president of the united states many if not all of those coconspirators would have been then indicted and tried as supporters of terrorism instead a new president and a new attorney general came in and instead of being indicted and tried for supporting terrorism as they were named in the federal district court in dallas and the fifth circuit court of appeals said in opinionsthere was plenty of evidence to support that they were coconspiratorswell the new administration dropped the matter and these people became helpful to the administration in advising on islam it also notes that mr alamoudi was a founding trustee of the fiqh council of north america a board member of the interfaith impact for justice and peace a regional representative for the islamic society of north americawhich was also a named coconspirator for supporting terrorisma board member of mercy international president of the muslim student association of the unitedstates and canada a board member of the somali relief fund secretary of the muslim brotherhood affiliated success foundation and director of the talibah international aid association in fact in an article back in 2004 andrew c mccarthy noted that abdurahman alamoudi was sentenced today to 23 years imprisonment for terrorism financing false statements on his naturalization petition and tax violations the sentence was imposed by judge claude hilton of the unitedstates district court in alexandria virginia alamoudi was influential in the american muslim circles and thus in washington he participated in several political and charitable organizations founding the american muslim councilan enthusiastic supporter of hamas and hezbollah the federal government permitted him a key role in selecting the islamic clerics who minister in the military and in the prison system over the years moreover he occasionally traveled the globe as an emissary of the state department as we now know he also traveled to libya engaged in financial transactions with qadhafis government and collected hefty sums including the 340 000 seized from him when he was arrested last year which were designed to be routed back to his causes in the unitedstates without the knowledge of american authorities all of those activities violate the international emergency economic powers act imposes terrorismrelated sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with libya i will parenthetically insert here that it had to be very convenient for mr alamoudi this convicted supporter of terrorism to be working for the state department as he went to different countries and apparently continued to conspire to support terrorism as the state department funded his travel on its behalf but also found was this article the author was brian blomquist and the date is june 27 2003 it is an article about the esteemed unitedstates senator charles or chuck schumer entitled schumer wants fanatical imams rooted out of jails armed forces the article says militant muslim imams are preaching a distorted hateful form of islam to unitedstates soldiers and federal prisoners creating a dangerous situation senator charles schumer charged yesterday schumer said the problem is that the pentagon and the federal bureau of prisons select muslim imams on the advice of islamic groups in the grip of the fanatical wahhabism strain of the religion while the potential wahhabi influence in the unitedstates armed forces is not well documented these organizations have succeeded in ensuring that militant wahhabism is the only form of islam that is preached to the 12 000 muslims in federal prison schumer said at a senate hearing on extremist wahhabi islam which has been linked to terrorism in february the new york prison system barred its top muslim chaplain from its prison facilities after the imam warith dean umar said the 9 11 hijackers should be treated as martyrs the imams flood the prisons with antiamerican probin laden videos literature and sermon tapes the point of prison should be to rehabilitate violent prisoners mr schumer is so right the article goes on the bureau of prisons uses the graduate school of islamic and social sciences which is under investigation for possible funneling of money to terrorists and the islamic society of north america which has board members with terror links schumer charged american muslim foundation president abdurahman alamoudi said his organization had no role advising the pentagon alamoudi said he formerly gave the pentagon advice on selecting imams but they pushed me out well we know that that was not until right before the british government arrested alamoudi and then provided apparently the unitedstates government plenty of evidence to show that alamoudi was supporting terrorism that is why i was so shocked since the fbi got information from britain gathered their own information that they had been gathering at least since 1991 on radical islamic beginnings here in the united states that during the bush administration the fbi would have a partnership outreach program with the council of americanislamic relations of which mr alamoudi was a board member cair was a named coconspirator for supporting terrorists which the courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are while the fbi had gathered such evidence they were outreach partners with this organization cair named as a coconspirator with the holy land foundation this article from wnd pentagon admits chaplains from muslim brotherhood group published on march 6 2014 by aaron klein said the unitedstates army and air force has selected two muslim chaplains from a program run by an islamic group closely tied to the muslim brotherhood that was named by the justice department as an unindicted coconspirator in a scheme to raise money for hamas wnd broke the story in 2011 that the controversial islamic society of north america or isna is the official endorsing agency for the unitedstates armed forces muslim chaplain program wnd further reported that year that the muslim chaplain program was founded by a terrorsupporting convict while the armys first islamic chaplain who is still serving has been associated with a charity widely accused of serving as an alqaida front now isna has announced that two of its former applicants for chaplaincy were selected to serve on active duty in the united states army and air force the significance of this news is that the department of defense has not selected an isnaendorsed chaplain for active duty in over 15 years said the isna press release isna chaplain services director and islamic endorsing agent abdulrasheed muhammad said in a statement that the two chaplains selected for active duty are ready to serve allah and the countrymaking the statement in that order after speaking by phone with both soldiers it was more than clear both were eager and ready to serve allah and country may allah bless our new chaplain candidates and their families as they prepare for new challenges and opportunities in the army and air force chaplain corps said muhammad while the new chaplains ties to isna has received some attention in the conservative blogosphere in recent days missing from the conversation is the larger partnership between the unitedstates military and not just the isna but also other terrortied groups in fact muhammad himself the isnas endorsing agent has been tied to a group accused of serving as an alqaida front by the way parenthetically 1993 was the year in which we had another terrorist attack that being the first attempted bombing or the first bombing of the word trade center in an attempt to bring it down and kill tens of thousands of americans since the muslim chaplain programs inception in 1993 isna has been the official endorsing agency of the new chaplains in 2005 isna initiated a yearly muslim chaplain conference that includes leadership talks for chaplains in both the military and the unitedstates prison system discover the networks notes that isnathrough its saudigovernmentbacked affiliate the north american islamic trustreportedly holds the mortgages on 50 percent to 80 percent of all mosques in the unitedstates and canada thus the organization can freely exercise ultimate authority over these houses of worship and their teachings states discover the networks isna was founded in 1981 by the saudifunded muslim students association which was founded partially by the muslim brotherhood the two groups are still partners wnd previously attended an msa event at which violence against the unitedstates was urged by speakers we are not americans shouted one speaker muhammad faheed at queensborough community college in 2003 we are muslims the unitedstates is going to deport and attack us it is us versus them truth against falsehood the colonizers and masters against the oppressed and we will burn down the masters house well with those kind of comments coming at their meetings it is so wonderful that principles from these organizations have such close ties with the current leadership in the country in the white house in the state department and in the justice department this article goes on isna was named in a may 1991 muslim brotherhood document an explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the group in north america as one of the brotherhoods likeminded organizations of our friends who shared the common goal of destroying america and turning it into a muslim nation according to discover the networks islam scholar stephen schwartz describes isna as one of the chief conduits through which the radical saudi form of islam passes into the united states according to terrorism expert steven emerson isna is a radical group hiding under a false veneer of moderation that publishes a bimonthly magazine islamic horizons that often champions militant islamist doctrine the group also convenes annual conferences where islamist militants have been given a platform to incite violence and promote hatred states emerson emerson cites an isna conference in which alqaida supporter and plo official yusuf al qaradhawi was invited to speak emerson further reports that in september of 2002 a full year after 9 11 speakers at isnas annual conference still refused to acknowledge osama bin ladens role in the terrorist attacks also isna has held fundraisers for terrorists notes discover the networks after hamas leader mousa marzook was arrested and eventually deported in 1997 isna raised money for his defense the group also has condemned the unitedstates governments post9 11 seizure of the financial assets of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad isna meanwhile has an extensive relationship with the obama administration which recently announced it is open to diplomacy with the muslim brotherhood this is where i have to say having visited with leaders in the middle east muslim leaders who are actually friends of the united states not in official open meetings but when we get in private they ask the question why does your unitedstates administration continue to support the muslim brotherhood do you not understand the muslim brotherhood has been at war with the united states since 1979 and you have got friendly muslims that want to help youi would submit that the current president of egypt is one of thoseand yet you are insistent on helping the muslim brotherhood that is at war with the united states oh not with violence yet but they claim they are getting so much accomplished in taking over the united states without violence that they dont want to use that yet that will come later if necessary but right now they are doing such a good job as advisers and in important positions in the administration that they should not be using violence well back to the article the relationship began even before obama took office one week before last years presidential inauguration again keeping in mind this article is from 2014 one week before last years presidential inauguration sayyid syeed national director of isnas office for interfaith and community alliances was part of a delegation that met with the directors of obamas transition team the delegation discussed a request for an executive order ending torture isna president mattson represented american muslims at obamas inauguration where she offered a prayer during the televised event mattson also represented isna at obamas ramadan dinner at the white house in june 2009 obama senior aide valerie jarrett invited mattson to work on the white house council on women and girls which jarrett leads yeah that is what you want you want someone who supports the muslim brotherhoods idea that women dont have rights they have no business showing their face in public or driving or having property yeah that is what you want advising the white house on womens issues for heavens sake the article goes on one month later the justice department sponsored an information booth at an isna bazaar in washington d c also that month jarrett addressed isnas 46th annual convention according to the white house jarrett attended as part of obamas outreach to muslims in february obamas top adviser on counterterrorism john brennan came under fire for controversial remarks he made in a speech to muslim law students at an event sponsored by isna at new york university in his speech brennan who later became cia director stated that having a percentage of terrorists released by the unitedstates return to terrorist attacks isnt that bad since the recidivism rate for inmates in the unitedstates prison system is higher he also criticized parts of the bush administrations response to 9 11 as a reaction some people might say was over the top in some areas that in an overabundance of caution we implemented a number of security measures and activities that upon reflection now we look back after the heat of the battle has died down a bit we say they were excessive ok wnd reported brennan stated at the isnaorganized event that the obama administration is working to calibrate policies in the fight against terrorism that ensure americans are never profiled speaking at the questionandanswer session brennan declared himself a citizen of the world we need to be looking at ourselves as individuals not the way we look or the creed we have or our ethnic background i consider myself a citizen of the world he said brennan told the audience the obama administration is trying to make sure that we as americans can interact in a safe way balance policies in a way that optimizes national security but also optimizes the opportunity in this country never to be profiled never to be discriminated against yes that is right sure if you hate america and you want americas western lifestyle and freedoms destroyed you want women subjugated we shouldnt profile people just because they want america destroyed as part of their religious beliefs that kind of thinking gets a nation in trouble and thus we are in trouble this article was published this week january 5 2016 from jennifer hickey ripe for radicalization federal prisons breeding ground for terrorists say experts here we are in 2016 substantiating the statements that senator chuck schumer made back in 2003 that our prisons have been for years now a breeding ground for radical islamism under both republican and democratic administrations we have allowed people who have been namedand for which the federal courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are coconspirators in financing terrorism and supporting terrorismwe have allowed them to pick imams approve imams put imams in our military and in our prisons is it any surprise that 13 years after chuck schumer raised that issue that since nothing has been done about it that the federal prisons are a breeding ground for radical islamists this quote from representative stephen fincher my friend from tennessee says over the years our federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization that is supportive of what chuck schumer said years ago in fact this article by carol brown december 5 2014 american thinker com prisons are breeding grounds for jihadist muslims comprise 15 of the prison population this number far exceeds the percentage of muslims in the general population it is eighteen times greater to be exact so there are 18 times more muslims in federal prison than the percentage of muslims in the general population that raises issues questions and problems put another way there are about 2 4 million muslims in the united states and 350 000 of them are in jail that means more than 12 of muslims in america are incarcerated reports on the number of prisoners who convert to islam vary and are framed in different ways some sources estimate 40 000 prisoners per year convert others put the numbers closer to 135 000 per year some posit that 80 of inmates who find faith while in prison convert to islam one thing is for sure the majority of those who convert to islam in prison are black with as many as one in three black prisoners converting the number of hispanic prisoners converting to islam is also on the rise these numbers are staggering and the implications are serious as will be addressed further on in this article there are numerous reasons why conversions to islam are skyrocketing in our jails many prisoners feel angry disenfranchised and yes even victimized and wronged by society many harbor a deep disdain for america they are therefore prime targets for recruitment to a religious ideology that shares many of these attitudes in addition islamic teachings are often framed as a noble code of ethics to live by case in point the nation of islam is the largest prison ministry i am sure they are meaning the largest prison ministry in the united states this is going on as i speak it has been going on for the 13 years since chuck schumer brought it up in the senate and we dont appear to have learned any lessons from this my friend dana rohrabacher is pushing that we invite the president of egypt president elsisi to come speak to a joint session of congress i was talking to chairman royce about it he believes it would be a good idea our majority whip steve scalise just met with president elsisi in egypt i am thrilled he did he is a muslim leader who understands the muslim brotherhood is a threat to freedom in egypt and in america and in europe it is time we did something about it to protect ourselves you dont have to profile muslims but you should be profiling those who are studying radical islam like qutb like in his booklet milestones which osama bin laden said radicalized himor helped yet this administration will not allow our justice department our intelligence departments and agencies and our state department to be educated on radical islam so of course you are going to be admitting a woman who takes a mans name that denotes a terrorist islamic jihadist from hundreds of years ago tashfeen malik our homeland security has run off people who are real patriots like phil haney and who are brilliant on the issue of radical islam we have run them out the message is clear that you had better not study radical islam and you had better not know anything about radical islam in homeland security because if you do we will run you off if we dont do something worse thank god phil haney had such a clean record they were looking for anything our country is in trouble and there are people who want to destroy it it is ridiculous that anybody still has to say we know all muslims are not terrorists of course they are not but it is ridiculous to continue to allow and to even encourage radical islamist imams in our prisons to transform prisoners into additional radical jihadists who are going to go off like bombs figuratively and literally at some point down the road we also have to look at our immigration policy when it comes to continuing to allow people like alamoudiwho hates america who considers himself to be a person who could help bring about the global caliphate a person who is financing terrorismhave his wife come and have a child in america before he started trying to radicalize that country and take power unto himself as if he were a dictator morsis wifemorsi the former president of egypthad a child here do you think that child was being brought up to love america do you think alamoudis child was being raised to love america while his parents were scheming to terrorize it anwar alawlaki is one about whom my friends on both sides of the aisle have discussed the proprieties or improprieties of having a president just issue an order to kill an american citizen anwar alawlaki a man who led staffers in muslim prayers right here on capitol hill capitol hill staffers were led in prayer by a man who ultimately the obama administrationthe president himselfconsidered to be so dangerous he had to take him out with a drone strike in yemen he was so dangerous to the united states that we couldnt even risk arresting him later he had to take him out with a bomb strike how was he an american citizen his parents who raised him to hate america came to america on student visas they studied here and had anwar alawlaki they took him back to yemen and taught him to hate america he became so dangerous that even president obama felt he had to order a strike on an american citizen without his having had a trial without due process he felt he had to take him out with a drone because that american citizenan american citizen only because his parents came here on visaswas too dangerous for them to do anything else it is time we started protecting our homeland and we need an administration that will do it in closing let me just add that the reports have been that the obama administration used the nsa to spy on members of congress to help it keep the iran treaty in play we have got to get to the bottom of that if it turns out that our president was unconstitutionally spying on members of congress i do not care if they were all democrats or republicans i do not care they may have been democrats it doesnt matter if he were spying on members of congressusing the nsa or any other government agency to spy on members of congresswe need to find out if it happened if he were he needs to be removed from office period otherwise we cant save the nation i hope and pray those allegations are not true i hope and pray that the president of the united states did not have the nsa spying on members of congress to help him with the iran deal to help him as he was supporting the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world i hope and pray that is not true i hope and pray it is not but we need to find out i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.547778844833374,

they spoke of struggling to get by despite working full time on paychecks that are just too small i hope we will take their struggles to heart and join the congressional progressive caucus in our efforts to ensure a goodpaying job for all americans too many americans are still struggling to find a job that pays more than the bare minimum they dont want to just get by they want to get ahead and they want to live the american dream they deserve to live the american dream they are looking for a job that pays an actual living wage a job that will provide them with paychecks big enough to lift themselves out of poverty into the middle class a job where they can take care of their families and make sure the bills are paid and maybe save for retirement these are american values that everyone wants to live by and to achieve a few decades ago these jobs were accessible to most americans yet because of the great recession and wage stagnation too many americans are working harder and harder for paychecks that keep them trapped in poverty in the worlds richest and most powerful nation this really is a disgrace a report released just 2 days ago from the university of california at berkeley in my district found that allowing companies to pay workers wages that keep them in poverty costs taxpayers 152 billion a year that is outrageous instead of doing the right thing and paying for a living wage these corporations are reaping record corporate profits while leaving families to struggle and taxpayers on the hook now as a former smallbusinessowner myself i can tell you that paying poverty wage is no way to run a business paying a living wage with benefits is good for business and it is the right thing to do as we continue to build support for the good jobs movement i know that more and more businessowners will see the benefit of paying a living wage and will join our cause everyone deserves a job that allows them to make a living and provides them with the right to form a union it is the economically sensible thing to do you can ask any college or high school student who has taken economics 101 when we empower workers to fight for themselves and provide them a big paycheck our country becomes fairer and our economy grows people who are working should not be living below the poverty line so 15 an hour that is the minimum that we should be paying our workers certain parts of the country 15 an hour just barely barely helps them put food on the table so we need to get to a living wage and we need to talk about what that means in different parts of the country so i want to thank you again congresswoman watson coleman for your leadership for bringing us together we have got to stay focused on this because everyone deserves a path out of poverty into the middle class everyone in our country deserves to live the american dream"], [0.5459473729133606, 0.4540526270866394, 1, "with over 30 americans killed by a gun every single day for far too long i

the floor if the capitol still exists and will point out that this deal that obama and kerry and wendy sherman did with iran in allowing them to move forward with nuclear activity providing them with

needs hopwa combines housing support with additional services to help people living with hiv aids and their families stay in stable safe housing manage their illness and remain active in their communities housing interventions are critical in our continued fight against hiv aids and research clearly shows that stable housing leads to better health outcomes providing stable housing to people living with hiv aids reduces the risk of transmission to a partner by 96 percent it reduces emergency room visits and expense to the public by 36 percent and hospitalizations by 57 percent in other words investing a modest amount in hopwa today saves us millions if not billions of federal taxpayer dollars in the future hopwa is the only federal housing program to provide cities and states with dedicated resources to address the housing crisis facing people living with hiv aids and the program traditionally enjoys strong bipartisan support congressional support for hopwa is clear in this legislation while nearly every other program in the bill has been slashed by millions of dollars and often funded at levels below the point of actually functioning hopwa saw a slight increase in funding during the committees consideration of the bill some hail the bills slim 332 million for hopwa as a victory i also applaud any additional funding for hopwa but i cannot call it a victory to fund this program below its 2010 funding level when wait lists for hopwa services continue to grow and thousands of americans die on the streets and in shelters because we refuse to provide a few extra million dollars to provide them with the care they need i will not claim that my amendment completely solves that problem the national aids housing coalition estimates that in fy16 they will need 364 million to provide hopwa services to those who need them and to fund vital administrative support to improve the program to reach that goal we would need to find 32 million somewhere in this bill to transfer to hopwa but the funding levels we are considering today are so abysmally low it is nearly impossible to move that much money without gutting other important programs what we do at the very least is pass my amendment to restore hopwa to its fy10 funding level of 335 million a scant 3 million increase that funding level makes only a small dent in hopwas real need but it will give hundreds more people and families access to lifesaving services it is a very small step but it is in the right direction and i believe if we have the chance to save even one life let alone hundreds we
