of great ecological importance they along with the rest of the gallatin range are part of the greater yellowstone ecosystem and include the endangered grizzly bear one of the largest elk herds in the

family and medical leave act may be a sweet political victory for the new administration and congrss but it is sure to leave a bitter taste in the mouths of employees and employers alike the mandates in this bill would require an employer with 50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for the birth adoption and foster care of a child for the care of a child spouse or parent with a serious health condition or for an employee with a serious health condition during the leave the employee is entitled to keep all health benefits and is guaranteed the same or equivalent

need it most as mr granoy has so appropriately stated peace of mind does not pay the bills and peace of mind is all that will come out of the family and medical leave act a third objection is that this bill would dimnish the availability of benefits employers can offer with h r 1 as law employers will have to make adjustments in their benefits plan to accommodate the costs of the new mandate the benefit pie is only so big and once a slice is made for family and medical leave then health insurance benefits pay raises christmas bonuses paid vacations or some other benefit will necessarily

problem under the current pension law wherein former pension plan participants may be denied appropriate relief to remedy certain fiduciary breaches in particular s 1312 would amend the employee retirement income security act of 1974 to allow the secretary of labor and former pension participants to seek appropriate relief when erisa violations involving the purchase of annuities occur in connectionwith the termination of a pension plan or an individuals statusas a participant in july of 1993 the subcommittee on labormanagement relations held an oversight hearing on this annuity issue among other erisa enforcement issues during the hearing concern was raised that after the decision by the supreme court in mertens versus hewitt current law could be read as narrowing the remedies under erisa upon which participants and beneficiaries have previously relied to fully restore denied pension plan benefits specifically there was concern that the case could undermine the efforts of the department of labor to recover the reduction of annuity payments for former pension plan participants in the case of kayes versus pacific lumber which was cited in the mertens case the unitedstates district court for the northern district of california held that former participants and beneficiaries who were given executive life annuities do not have standing to sue under title i of erisa s 1312 would clarify that erisa does give standing to former participants and beneficiaries if they seek relief in connection with a fiduciary breach involving the purchase of insurance contracts or annuities under s 1312 this standing would be retroactive in connection with legal proceedings pending or brought on or after may 31 1993 my understanding is that there are a number of

extraordinary amount of time and patience and each year i am impressed with the consclentious effort put forth by all members of this subcommittee this year the bill provides a 630 6 million federal payment the payment represents 24 percent of the revenues collected by the district in fiscal year 1992 consistent with the formula negotiated with the district and enacted into law in 1992 this is the second year we have used the formula to compute the federal payment unfortunately this is the second year that district officials have accused congress of somehow shortchanging the district although there is virtually unanimous agreement among members of the authorizing committee and the appropriations committee and an independent check by the government accounting office we still hear district officials trying to claim that this payment is deficient i for one very much regret that district officials are bashing congress over the amount of the federal payment we are using the formula negotiated with and agreed upon by the district and we are holding up our end of the bargain no other city in this country gets a check equal to 24 percent of their revenues collected the district government collects revenues from a variety of sources including per sonal and corporate income taxes property taxes sales taxes room taxes and many other fees on top of these revenues we add the federal payment which does not require any collection effort and has grown 244 million over the last 10 yearsa 63percent increase despite our budget problems the purpose of the formula is to provide a predictable and reliable income for the district to plan its budget i think congress has been extremely fair and i hope that we can get pass the blame game over the federal payment formula this year we have seen the district struggling with a severe budget problem it has been heartening to see a sincere effort underway to streamline the district government making tough but needed cuts i offered an amendment in subcommittee to help the district not with a temporary fix but with a change in law that allows the district to collect income taxes from sallie mae and fannie mae two organizations that have evolved from fledgling governmentsponsored pilot programs to highly successful profitable privately held corporations with earnings in excess of 3 billion in 1992 alone a preliminary estimate showed the district would receive 260 in revenues as a result of my amendment unfortunately my amendment was removed before this bill reached the floor remarkably one of the forces at work in opposing this provision was the district government itselfstrapped for revenues but unwilling to collect taxes from one of its most profitable businesses i predict that the removal of my amendment will not mark the end of the issue overall while this bill is under the subcommittees 602 b allocation it provides 17 million in excess funds over the federal governments commitment i oppose this excess funding which is why i worked to provide an alternative to using taxpayer funds for the district government at a time when we have a severe budget deficit i am also opposed to the change in current law which would allow the district to use federal funds to pay for abortions as well as the domestic partner provision which would allow the district to extend government benefits

by adopting this legislation congress is saying no to a policy that would resettle iraqi prisoners of war in the united states with full benefits at a cost to unitedstates taxpayers of approximately

they returned to iraq many were deserters who fled their units in fearfor their lives in the hours and days before the american led coalition forces sliced through the iraqi lines however nowhere and

cut us off from the opportunities that are essential if we are to prosper in the coming century rather than leaving the trade battle we must lead it nafta is absolutely essential there will always be legitimate concerns about any trade agreement and legitimate grounds to oppose trade agreements but as hard as we may wish for it we will never achieve a riskfree agreement that protects all american interests in my mind nafta is not a perfect agreement but i have concluded that it is unlikely that we could produce another agreement at least in the near future it is more likely that our place will be quickly taken by one or more of our economic competitors in any case the opportunity lost is an opportunity gained for europe japan and other asian countries who are making steady progress toward building their economic markets in the final analysis i must be guided by the interests of the people i represent there are almost as many opinions on that issue as there are individual north carolinians but i believe that nafta will be good for any state since 1987 north carolinas merchandise exports to mexico have grown by 365 percent in 1991 alone north carolina exported 2 2 billion in goods to mexico and canada perhaps most important 57 000 north carolina jobs are supported by manufactured exports to our north american neighbors and the state according to some estimates will reap a net gain of over 1 300 new jobs if nafta is implemented north carolina and the nation cannot afford to turn our backs on nafta we cannot afford to pass up the opportunity for measurable improvements
