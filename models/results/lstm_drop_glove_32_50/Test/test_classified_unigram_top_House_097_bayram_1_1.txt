as a legislative institution we have the opportunity to exercise a check on a colossal policy mistake by the executive branch the cause of world peace and that of fiscal responsibility will not allow us to fail i have consistently voted against funding of the mx missile system when i cast my votes against funds for the mx in the past i did so in the realistic expectation that the present membership of the house would not challenge the administration by rejecting a major weapons system i think the mood of the house is different today the house vote today will determine the course of defense spending not only in fiscal year 1983 but in the years to follow not only with respect to mx but also to a whole series of costly and unnecessary weapons systems i am convinced that a vote today for fiscal responsibility and defense sanity will influence our colleagues in the other body to join us in saying at last the mx and particularly the dense pack system is a waste of the taxes paid by the people who have sent us to this house through fiscal year 1982 this system has already cost us over 4 7 billion the administration has requested an additional 4 5 billion for the current fiscal year including the first construction fundsa very significant policy decision it is curious to say the least that the administration is requesting 1 4 billion for procurement initiating actual production when it is still requesting funds for research and development the rhetorical question that occurs to one is is this systpm ready to go or not opposition to the mx is not partisan i opposed the mx missile years ago when president carter asked for funds for it i did so because i had grave reservations about committing our nation to such an expensive and questionable system the questions are answered the doubts resolvedagainst the system the dense pl k basing system the latest concoction of the department of defense for basing the mx does not make me very confident about spending 35 or 40 billion of taxpayer money if i or one of our colleagues came before this house to ask for onetenth as much money for a domestic human resources program with a proposal as harebrained as the dense pack we would hear the catcalls on the other side of the beltway the time has come to look upon the mx with the same skepticism applied to nondefense spending the proposed basing system is untried and untestable furthermore the mx appears to be based upon the unrealistic window of vulnerability theory at any first strike attack on the united states the soviet union would face certain and massive unitedstates retaliation the issue before us now is whether the unitedstates house of representatives wm approve billions of dollars for an unworkable missile system with an untested basing mode i am deeply concerned about the implications on the relationship between congress and the executive in the development of defense policy if we rubber stamp the ridiculous mx proposal i ask the question what kind of legislative institution would approve such a proposal if we approve funds for procurement of the mx we should consider abolishing the appropriations process and bring administration defense budgets directly to the floor under a unanimous consent request the legislation before us contains funds for procurement as a result of the narrowest possible vote in the appropriations committeea tie vote defeating an amendment to delete these funds i want to commend the gentleman from new york the chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee for his leadership in attempting to impose fiscal restraint and commonsense on the defense department budget he has won the admiration of all of us here in the house who want this senseless waste of taxpayer dollars to end i urge adoption of addabbo amendment as well as an end of all funding for the mx missile e"], [0.411801278591156, 0.588198721408844, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may require h r 6068 the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1983 is the fifth such bill in as many years reported out by the permanent select committee on intelligence like its predecessors it was approved unanimously in committee as it was by the committee on armed services this information was echoed by my colleague the gentleman from massachusetts who handled the rule on the majority side and our colleague the gentleman for arizona who handled the rule on the minority side i want to express to them my appreciation for their remarks concerning all the members of this particular committee and the nonpartisan manner in which it has operated as in past years this bill authorizes all the funds for the next fiscal year as well as supplemental funds in the current fiscal year for the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the unitedstates government the category of intelligence activities includes all the activities of the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national security agency other intelligence components of the department of defense and the departments of the army navy and air force the bureau of intelligence and research of the department of state the intelligence divisions of the federal bureau of investigation intelligence elements of the departments of the treasury and energy and the drug enforcement administration and the intelligence community staff of the director of central intelligence these activitles provide intelligence for the use of the president the cabinet the national security council and the joint chiefs of staff further this bill authorizes intelligencerelated activities of the department of defense which are programs that are integral to the defense force structure but which are similar to national intelligence programs and are often tasked for national intelligence purposes particularly in peacetime the similarity of programs and functions between the national intelligence programs and the intelligencerelated activities of the defense department is the reason that both are considered by the permanent select committee on intelligence and authorized in this bill we have worked to assure that the program areas arecomplementary and mutually supportive but not duplicative the referral of this bill to the committee on armed services has assured that the judgments we have made from an intelligence viewpoint are equally sound from a military perspective we have worked closely with that committee on a continuous basis and achieved a position agreeable to both committees even before referral most intelligence activities are classified and necessarily so in some cases even the very existence of the program or activity is held secret this sensitivity limits the description we can offer here on the floor the schedule of authorizations to accompany the bill and the classifled annex to the report have been available to members a number of members have reviewed these materials the subject material is complex but we have continued to revise these classified reports to improve their clarity the committee continues to recommend that the budget for intelligence not be disclosed the disclosure of a single budget number might not itself be harmiul but some explanation of the content and meaning of the number would be essential but such an explanation would be excessively revealing moreover the committee recognizes that intelligence is inherently secret and any disclosure is the beginning of an erosive process in discussing this point people often refer to the degree of disclosure of our military budgets and systems it is not a good analogy the existence of military systems must be known in order to have deterrent value if deterrence fails military systems are effective in battle because of their numbers the manner in which they are employed and the skill of the personnel using them conversely in the case of intelligence the mere awareness of an intelligence activity can easily reduce or eliminate its effectiveness may endanger lives and may lead to the collection of false information contrived by our adversaries to confuse or mislead us i would like to summarize briefly the organization of i r title i provides for the bulk of our intelligence and intelligencerelated activities as i said earlier funds and program details are in the classified schedule of authorizations and the annex to the report one exception is the authorization for the counterterrorism program of the fbi which is unclassified the bill provides 12 1 million for this function title ii provides necessary authorities for the intelligence community staff whose function is to assist the director of central intelligence with his responsibilities for overall coordination of intelligence and preparation of the budget the staff is made up of representatives of all elements of the intelligence community administratively it is treated as if part of the cia title iii provides authorization of 91 3 million for the central intelligence agency retirement and disability system this is a program established by congress in 1964 to provide for those cia personnel who perform hazardous duties or are in special situations usually abroad which may limit the length of their careers when title iii is read for amendment i will offer a technical amendment that would conform ciards as it is called so as to afford certain ciards retirees the opportunity to exercise options which can be made by their counterparts under the civil service retirement and disability system although current law now permits the president by executive order to conform ciards to prospective changes made to the civil service system the differences in question existed prior to this change in the law hence the need for the amendments title iv authorizes additional intelligence and intelligencerelated expenditures in fiscal year 1982 the details of this supplemental authorivation are found in the classified annex to the committees report title v consists of a provision prohibiting the unauthorized use of the defense intelligence agencys name initials or seal in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such use was authorized and authorizing the attorney general to seek to enjoin such unauthorized use this section is identical to those enacted last year protecting against the unauthorized use of the cia and nsa names initials or seals title vi contains a provision providing to spouses and former spouses of certain cia employees entitlements and rights in relation to retirement and survivors annuities comparable to those provided to spouses of foreign service officers by the foreign service act of 1980 this provision recognizes the enormous equity that cia spouses have in their employee spouses careersboth in terms of the assistance they provide to intelligence operations and their sacrifice of their own professional advancement the committee was thoroughly persuaded that these spouses deserve the same benefits as do foreign service officers spouses nonetheless the bills provisions are more stringent than those of the foreign service act since they require that spouses to qualify must serve overseas with their employee spouses one reason for the bipartisan support which h r 6068 enjoys is that all of the recommendations of the subcommittee on program and budget authorization adopted by the committee have been so painstakingly documented and reasoned in their approach i attribute the great success of this effortand the important and oftneeded guidance it has provided the intelligence communityto the judgment and character of the ranking minority member ken robinson of virginia he has been the rock upon which the work of the subcommittee has been built and he deserves the thanks not only of the congr6ss but of the nation for his great contribution in this area i should also add that the staff who assist the committee in its consideration of the intelligence and intelligencerelated budgets is first class i believe they are the finest the most professional of all who work on the intelligence budget in either the executive or legislative branches i would like to pay tribute and thanks to duane andrews jim bush marty faga annette smiley and patrica garber as in the last fiscal year this bill authorizes less than the administration requested but still permits real growth over last year some specific proposals have been recommended for deferral others for termination while a few have been increased let me close by stating that as in years past the committee has made and continues to make the classfied annex to its report available to all members of the house

offer this amendment because of our concern over the level of defense spending being proposed in short the amendment would in all 3 fiscal years reduce defense budget authority by 16 billion defense outlays by 4 billion and revenues by 4 billion while i recognize the need for some increase in defense i think that it is clear that the level proposed is unreasonable also i think that the increases need to be primarily in the areas of operations and maintenance and readiness clearly we cannot afford and we do not in a strategic sense need all of the costly new weapons systems which have been broposed i personally do not see the need for the mx missile or the b1 bomber as examples when we add the 4 billion outlay cut in my amendment to the roughly 8 billion reduction the jones substitute already contains from the baseline and to the military pay provisions we then reach a total reduction of about 15 billion this level of reduction will force the armed services committee to make some very real and hard choices about weapons systems procurement such a reduction should not allow the committee to make easierand in my view less wisecuts in manpower spare parts and other readiness areas instead the committee will have to look at entire weapons systems and decide what we truly need and what we can afford further i am disturbed at the high level of tax increases contained in the jones budget particularly in the outyears i agree that some level of tax increase is justified as one component of or effort to reduce the deficit however i think that the jones substitute may be going somewhat too far consequently since my amendment cuts defense spending by 4 billion we do not need to raise taxes as much to achieve the same deficit level as is in the jones proposal thus the amendment also reduces the revenue level in jones by 4 billion i think that this is a reasonable proposal one which will improve the jones substitute and i urge my colleagues to support my

supported after certain amendments it has already been pointed out that ceta has been under attack there is no question about it we all got it when we went home with people saying you have got to get rid of that ceta program get rid of it with its waste and abuses those of us that have been involved with this program know that the attack was against the parts of the program which had come into being subsequent to those aspects which we will be talking about today the original manpower training program which evolved into ceta was radically changed when the concept of job creation was introduced it was on that point that the problems with ceta started when ceta was not focused on training people for jobs but was expanded into a program of creating jobs for people it then went on to be changed again into backdoor revenue sharing if members examine the criticisms of ceta it is to those aspects of ceta that the criticism is directed what we have for the members here today is a new bill we do not call it ceta any longer because that name because of those problems that it had faced became so blemished with the difficulties which were associated with those aspects regarding job creating and backdoor revenue sharing what we have for the members today is a joint effort to again get back to the essential elements and the purposes of the original training sections that is to

interest in employment training and especially youth employment and training prior to his death he spent much time on this bill and did as much as he could to see that we could come forward with a

talked about congressman hawkins certainly the chairman of the committee congressman perxins and also the gentlewoman from new york mrs chisholm and many others who have been most helpful in bringing about a bipartisan effort in addition the business community has come forward as i have never seen before to assist and to bring forth a partnership program which this bill tries to mold and i think successfully does i refer to the national alliance of business in particular the national association of manufacturers the chamber of commerce and the national association of machine tool industry they have all come forward with constructive ideas to make this a workable program in addition of course we have had the cooperation of labor and their involvement here is critical in developing a bipartisan and a joint effort education representatives from around the country appeared at hearings and gave us excellent suggestions on how to build the kind of cooperation we need in the educational community to end some of the problems we have had in particular i would like to commend the commissioner of education gordon aurbach for his excellent suggestions the american vocational

is scary let us look at 1982 in 1982 with the presidents program in place we still have 689 billion worth of spending in 1983 we still have 731 billion worth of spending in 1984 we still have 770 billion worth of spending the budget that president carter sent to us before he left office called for an increase in federal spending over fiscal year 1981 of 11 6 percent even with the budget that the president has submitted to us we are still going to be over 6 1 percent so we are really not cutting that budget we are merely restraining its growth and that we must do let us take a look at another chart that is also scary one on deficits i have said many times from this well this really hurts me more than the spending why because we have been living on our childrens and our grandchildrens credit cards and that does not make me happy even though i have not voted for most of these programs that have caused this explosion we ought to feel ashamed of ourselves we ought to feel ashamed of ourselves and i think many of us do as to what we are putting on their backs and what we are putting on their backs is exactly this when they become taxpayers they are going to have to pay not only their current cost of government but also that tremendous interest charge that they inherited from us i do not care which budget you go for today they are going to pay from 85 to 90 billion worth of interest in that budget and they are not getting any benefits let us take a look at this explosion in the year 1955 the federal deficit stood at 274 billion here is where we are in 1977 709 billion and here in 1981 we go to 994 billion one of the first actions of this house was to increase the debt limit to 985 billion and as sure as i stand in this well today before this year is upand i speak of the calendar yearyou are going to have to go over that trillion dollars in debt and that is not good in 1982 it goes off the chart right off the chart that is what we are talking about and we are not happy about it you almost have to have two sheets of paper when you start to put the debt down in 1982 that debt has got to go to 1 060 000 000 000 no ifs ands or buts about it and that is what brings us here now let us take a look at just one other chart and that has to do with taxestaxes these are changes in personal taxes if we adopt the bipartisan substitute we look at the blue if we do nothing the current law increases are in red the jones proposals are in black in fiscal year 1981 you have no changes under jones in 1981 there is 25 billion in tax increases if you do nothingif you do nothing if you adopt the presidents program there is only 6 billion changes in 1982 the presidents program calls for 44 billion in cuts but we still have not caught up with the increases the increases will be 52 billion so we are still behind but under the jones proposal we are going to be back at 21 billion see the gap we are not catching up with the tax increases in personal taxes these are your constituents paying these taxes in 1983 under our proposal you go ahead slightly over the increases 81 billion as opposed to 1980 under the jones proposal you are at 31 in 1984 under our proposal you go to 118 billion and you are just slightly ahead there 112 the jones proposal 76 billion that is what we are talking about i could get into a couple of other matters on inflation but we all know about inflation everybody back home knows about inflation we have been hearing about it we are going to do something about it i am finished with the charts we had an election last november everybody knows that and our president made no bones about his position he told the american people youi elect me president of the united statcs and we are going to turn this thing around what was he talking about he was talking about some of the things i have just pointed out to you on the charts that are indisputable you cannot dispute them and you cannot feel happy about them they are there what did the people say they gave him an overwhelming mandatean overwhelming mandate to make changes and hie came forward and made requests to this congress pursuant to the mandate the people gave him to make those changes that is what it is all about that is what it is all about he said i have got a package i have got a package that must be adopteda package no 1 of spending reductions tax cuts regulatory reform everybody hias heard from back home if you have been here long enough you have heard for years about all of those regulations that are choking american industry and american business i do not care how large or how small you are in business you felt that yoke around your neck getting tighter and tighter everybody has complained about it and this president said we want to get some regulatory reform the fourth part of his package is some stable monetary policy now before getting into some of his proposals let me point out a couple other things i do not agree with every suggestion that is in this package but i agree with the direction ~that package will take america if i were putting it together i probably would have tinkered a little bit here or there

congress is debating a deployment scheme for the mx missile to protect it from sneak attacks closely spaced basing is a defensive arrangement based on a theory of nuclear fratricide the theory of nuclear fratricide is impossible to test it is imliortant to evaluate what we do not know when we consider the value of dense pack basing the dense pack theory postulates that in the hellfire environment of an atomic attack later incoming warheads would be destroyed by electromagnetic pulse or debris kickedup in the maelstrom of the blast through which our missiles can supposedly be launched this defense scenario is based on a hiroshima type blast in the air the picture is radically altered by a groundburst detonation proponents of dense pack claim this would enhance and lengthen the fratricide effect for incoming missiles it is unknown whether mx could launch through this environment however it is important to remember that the environment created by an atomic blast is not clearly understood an appropriate analogy would be comparing it to conducting launch operations on the surface of the sun if only momentarily furthermore should the soviets be capable of simultaneously detonating warheads the dynamics of the blast environment changes totally and incomprehensibly second let me caution my colleagues that we are plainly deluding ourselves if we believe that fratricide will be the defense of the dense pack with this particular configuration it is postulated that there would be a limited number of cross pull or trajectories which could be attack corridors for a soviet nuclear salvo on the 14 square mile target in wyoming theoretically it should be possible to defend this area with an antiballistic missile system rather like a video arcade game a single abm system is permitted under the salt treaty the extremely difficult technical problems which must be overcome to implement an abm system include differentiating mirv warheads from meteorites which they would resemble on radar and submarine launch ballistic missiles could invalidate the defense by launching south to north or west to east i hope my colleagues will attempt to evaluate the cost factors it was nearly a decade ago this body rejected the abm not on the grounds of technical feasibility but prohibitive costs that was prior to a threefold decrease in the value of the dollar you have not been told this but it cannot be denied if you buy the dense pack you will ultimately be forced to buy abm at a price that is anyones guess you will be allocating a massive

transportation and the subcommittee on surface transportation and i introduced h r 3210 the federalaid highway act of 1981 this legislation essentially was a 1year bill which contained increased budget authority in certain of our contract authority federalaid highway programs to bring the total authorizations up to the level recommended by the new administration to be certain the administration did propose and send to congress a bill significantly restructuring these programs and did suggest the adoption of multiyear legislation because of the relatively late submission of these proposals because the congress spent so much of its time fashioning our omnibus budget reconciliation act and because of our may 15 deadline for reporting authorizing legislation from the committee as mandated in the 1974 budget act it was felt that there was not sufficient time to carefully consider a comprehensive restructuring of our highway program which would certainly have a long lasting impact on the nations transportation infrastructure since may 15 the surface transportation subcommittee has held 8 days of hearings in washington and in the field on the countrys future transportation needs it is only now in the closing days of the 1st session of the 97th congress that i feel comfortable drafting legislation which will play such a significant role in shaping the future of our countrys transportation policy i am convinced it would have been a grave error to undertake such an effort before we had increased our knowledge and enhanced our awareness of the problems and challenges facing us to the extent that we have today this is not to say that we failed to resp~ond in drafting h r 3210 to the initiatives put forward by the administration as i have previously stated the authorization levels contained therein did conform to those recommended by the white house and perhaps more significantly with the leadership of the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from california we embraced and adopted the concept posited by the administration to redefine the nations interstate system as some of my colleagues may be aware 1981 marks the 25th anniversary of the interstate system fewer perhaps are cognizant of the fact that most of the system is constructed with a design life of 20 to 25 years we have now reached the point then when 95 percent of the total system is open to traffic but when also an increasing proportion of these miles are in need of reconstruction indeed one study has reported that the amount of interstate miles rated in poor condition more than doubled between 1975 and 1978 with another doubling anticipated by 1985 clearly this is a problem which must be addressed as passed in this chamber on september 24 h r 3210 added reconstruction to the interstate 3r programresurfacing restoration and rehabilitationto create a new 4r program funding for this program was increased from 275 million to 800 million additionally a more equitable formula was devised for distributing these funds among the states in passing h r 3210 this body was by no means neglectful of the very important job of completing the interstate system indeed the meeting of this challenge was facilitated by that bill and will be brought closer to fruition by the amendment that is before us today mindful of the increased costs of freeway construction and our present budgetary constraints that bill and this amendment will allow us to focus the nations precious financial resources on the most crucial work that remains to be done certain nonessential projects on the interstate system are being dropped from the interstate cost estimate any project previously eligible under the ice but now dropped will be eligible under the expanded 4r program there were certain differences between items maintained under the ice in the house and senate bills this chamber for example maintained in the construction program all high occupancy vehicle lanes contained in the 1981 ice the senate bill failed to include this important provision but it is included in the amendment that is brought to the floor today by redefining eligibility for the interstate construction program we are able to reduce the interstate cost estimate from about 53 billion to about 38 8 billion this constitutes a sayings not even accounting for future inflation of about 14 billion let me repeat that by voting for this amendment we can save the american taxpayer 14 billion in the cost of completing the interstate system and by trimming these costs we will be expediting system completion by funneling available funds to those projects which are most crucial this amendment is vitally needed for the longrange implications it will have on the interstate program its enactment is also of very great shortterm significance the department of transportations authority to apportion interstate construction funds among the states expired at the end of fiscal year 1981 when our colleagues passed hi r 3210 earlier this year we extended that authority and revised the apportionment factors to reflect the redefinition of the system when it became apparent that hi r 3210 would not be enacted by october 1 house concurrent resolution 179 was brought to the floor and passed allowing the secretary to apportion interstate construction funds using our old factors that legislation was never adopted by our colleagues in the other body so these funds have been frozen in washington for over 10 weeks passage of this amendment will relieve that situation and relieve it in a most favorable manner by not only allowing these funds to be apportioned but by allowing them to be apportioned utilizing our redefined factors h r 3210 as passed by the house was significantly amended in the other body on november 16 and sent back to us the other body would have us hastily consider many of the same program revisions we chose to more thoroughly and thoughtfully examine next year since november 16 led by my good friend the gentleman from new jersey we have been working with senate leaders to fashion a compromise approach i feel that the

now serving in my 6th year in the congress of the united states and perhaps that is causing my increasing cynicism on this matter however it appears to me that while we have some basic problems in this country many of which have been caused by illadvised government policies which need to be revised or eliminated you would rather talk about these problems and point the finger of blame about these problems than address them we are in the 5th month of this 2d session of the 97th congress and we have done little or nothing could it be that you are quarterbacking a congressional stall until after the elections in november so as to try to make maximum political hay for your political party rather than let us address the problems confronting our country i hope this is not the case and in particular i would hope we could take up the urgent supplemental bill not only to consider its recommendations but also the amendment i have proposed along with my colleague from delaware to address a twofold problem first the boondoggle over at the synthetic fuels corporation and second the need to give the housing industry an emergency shot in the arm when you and your colleagues pulled the

out of a 900 million budget only 8 to 10 million1percentbe earmarked for the valuable work underway at the fire administration such a move is supported by every national fire service organization in the country and testimony before the science research and technology subcommittee by fema suggests that targeting 1 percent of its budget to the fire activities sponsored by usfa would pose no difficulties to femas overall effectiveiiess in fact in my opinion it would vastly improve the usefulness of fema to the average american as important as femas civil defense preparedness activities

and based upon the new information the dod came to its conclusions and to an agreement with nasa yesterday that new information resulted from the sts4 shuttle mission and recent tests on that flight

price increases than the average firm the question is how long must we sit before we recognize what is right in front of us our nation needs to unleash the innovative job creative tax paying power of

and a recent general accounting office report sates that the department of energys plan to build and install the clinch river breeder reactors steam generators before testing a prototype is hasardous

conventional nuclear reactors would be scarce several months ago however the research advisory board of the department of energy recommended postponing the crbr indefinitely since it is now know that

house have actually read those reports but i happen to have been involved in one of the items that the gao has referred to as waste but you have to understand what the gao is talking about when it talks about waste it is not what most of us think of as fraud or waste they take for example the xml tank they said that was an example of waste why was it an example of waste not because somebody did not know what he was doing or poured the money down a rathole it was because~ when we had completed a competent low technology effective tank the secretary of defense in 1976 decided to make an international example of it to allow the german gun which had been untried and an untried turbine engine which had never been in a tank to be added to it in so doing we automatically added 2 billion in cost to that tank but that is not the kind of waste that the gentlewoman from colorado has in mind where somebody filched paper clips out of a back office the fact of the matter is that the story that appeared in the paper this morningand i hope we do not put that weird idea into effectif we are going to put our mxs in c5as and then later we find out as i am sure we will that that basing mode does not function and nobody can tell exactly where the c5a is located when it fires off the mx the gao is going to say later on that was another big example of waste in the defense department waste in short is any attempt to try to achieve a capability when you really do not know exactly where you are going in this field we are stressing the state of the art"], [4.285573959350586e-05,

available of some of these infamous happenings to prove what took place an inordinate number of balts came to populate the forced labor camps those who lived to be released from the camps were never permitted to return to their native lands but were forced to live in central asia and other areas foreign to them by the end of 1949 a grand total of 850 000 people have been removed from their native landsor roughly 10 percent of the population of the countries involved from the soviet point of view this was a logical move they exterminated or removed most of the opposition to their rule or so they thought the clergy military officers and intellectuals however the resistance continues to this day and there are even forced labor camps on baltic soil today as part of their overall plan the

benefit of the house that this particular member may be in the minority but i happen to believe that this congress and successive administrations have plunged the district of columbia into an economic disaster over many many years in 1973 when we granted home rule integrity should have mandated that we look at the fiscal situation of the district of columbia evaluate those factors to which we contributed and then provide the necessary resources to at least allow them to be even and then go forward on their own but we did not do that we gave them the political authority to go forward but we have seen them continuing to be allowed to be plunged into economic disaster i agree with my colleague that we have to go into the structural problem and my hope is that when we come forward with

this discussion the fact is when the bi cost 40 million the b1 cost 57 million or today when it costs somewhere between 200 million and 400 million a copy depending upon whose estimate it is and every time this plane and the price tag that it carries has been compared n the mission that it was designed to do and in each and every time substantial concerns by people who understand the missions the purpose for which it was designed have been raised originally it was designed to fly high then there was a question whether it could do that and still penetrate somebody suggested general ellis who by the way was the commander in chief of the strategic air comiand the man who was supposed to fly this airplane whose troops were supposed to fly this airplane decided that the fb111 would be superior that it would only cost 10 billion would give us the same firepower the same penetrating ability so the b1 did not measure up at that price tag now we find out that widebodied standoff capability is a very realistic alternative so all of a sudden the bi is not realistic at this price capability so then we have to start saying well what is the mission of this airplane th fact of the matter is they have not yet been able to come up with a unique mission which this airplane can fulfill that cannot be fulfilled by another weapons system so what has happened is what you see here today perhaps the most important debate of this legislation outside of the mx hat this chamber is vacant relatively y o and yet people want to continue to i ay that defense spending military t pending should be brought under control but what has in fact happened s this system continues to go on they f continue to try to resurrect some misston which it can do but the fact is that if it is a cruise missile carrier there is wide bodied standoff capability that is available in a shorter period of time if it is a penetrating bomber t there are other alternatives to the i penetrating bomber i fact it is incredible the rational that has now surfaced that somehow tt can go in later and at 400 million a copy it can drop iron bombs on the soviet union i would suggest that if things have deteriorated to the point where this is going to be a conventional bomber there will be very little use for iron bombs after the nuclear destruction that has taken place within the soviet union and quite possibly in this country so what has happened is that over the 5 years or 10 years this program has been delayed it has never met its mission there has always been an alternative at whatever price they have tried to present the b1 bomber to us but let me suggest that something else is going on here for people who are watching this debate maybe hi fact what you have seen here today is you have seen the best argument for an amendment for a balanced budget because as long as these kinds of systems can be devised as long as these kinds of systems do not need to be scrutinized and can use up 40 billion of taxpayer revenues and be charged off to the deficit because that is where this system is going because nobody has the courage to stand up and raise the tax revenues to pay for this system perhaps a requirement on this body for a balanced budget would turn some of the energies that are used to make up missions for this unacceptable system that some of the energies would start looking at the alternatives we understand very clearly that careers are on the line in the pentagon careers are on the line in the industrial complex that supports this system we have all received letters from the subcontractors that demand that you vote for this system we can understand that but that is not the basis on which a strategic weapons system should be built it should be built upon whether or not it can meet the mission for which it is designed i think that congressman dellums has presented to this house substantial testimony not of his own but of people who are experts in this field people who have held positions of responsibility within the strategic air command within the department of defense within the intelligence community he has reported to this body that they have serious questionssome of them outright believe that this system should be abolished and et it grinds on and grinds on why lecause we are not required to pay for his extravagant system"],

for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in its fiscal year 1983 successor witness the increase from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1982 of 67 billionomb

the agency with the monumental task of coordinating unitedstates arms control policy the major elements of the house bill as amended are as follows the house bill as amended provides an authorization

language of such sums as may be necessary the 19 893 852 is a modest authorization to provide funds to sustain the complex ongoing start inf and mbfr negotiations which are in progress the money should also be spent in support of the agencys verification and monitoring activities which the president has stated are essential to supplement current reliance on national technical means of verifying arms control treaties in addition the authorization is in support of external research in nuclear nonproliferation and in the maintenance of a personnel ceiling of 175 staff adequate personnel is critical to support the complicated work of backstopping these important arms control initiatives adequate funding must be provided to the agency to continue these vital efforts initially the executive branch had requested that the 19 million authorization for the agency include the transfer of a 4 8 million department of energy program the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee fully support the doe reduced enrichment in research and test reactor rertr program as the research conducted under this program to searcx for new ways to develop low enric led uranium is vital to sustain our nu lear nonproliferation objectives however the coramittee believes that at this time the program should remain in the department of energy the committee hear been given assurances that the program will continue to enjoy the full support and funding of its traditional authorization and appropriation committees if the congress should concur with the dismantling of the department of energy this committee will conduct full and complete oversight hearings on this program and will carefully evaluate the transfer of the rertr program at that time to acda the amended bill deleted a provision in the house bill which would have changed the name of the agency to the arms control agency the me bers of both committees felt that this was not a propitious time to change the name of the agency and concurred with the senate on this program finally h r 3467 as amended included a senate provision which encourages the director of acda to pursue research development and other studies in anticipation of negotiations on antisatellite activities this is a highly desirable inclusion to the house bill and was fully supported by my colleagues in

individual wage data be reported quarterly to state employment agencies even though it is generaly acknowledged that this data is the best wage information for verification purposes in administering federal and state needsbased programs unreported and underreported wages are one of the principal causes of overpayments in needsbased programs although the exact amount of overpayments caused by recipients not properly reporting income is unknown the qeneral accounting office estimates that in fiscal years 1978 and 1979 five of six major welfare programs had annual overpayments of 867 million without corrective action federal expenditures because of overpayments in thpse five programs will probably exceed 1 billion in fiscal year 1983 in addition an unknown amount of other program benefits are improperly provided to cash grant recipients who would not be eligible for such benefits if their incomes were properly disclosed clearly this situation needs to be remedied given the current shortage of funds for public assistance programs we must insure that funds go only to those in need with the least amount of error or payment to those who may have other sources of income in addition
