i would like to take a brief moment to explain that s 2042 as passed by the house authorizes the vietnam womens memorial project inc to establish a memorial on federal land in the district of columbia or its environs to honor women of the armed forces of the united states who served in the republic of vietnam during the vietnam era the housepassed version of the bill makes it clear that this memorial will be established in full compliance with the commemorative works act of 1986 while also voicing the sense of congress that the most fitting and appropriate site for this commemorative is within the 2 2acre site surrounding the vietnam veterans memorial there has been some disagreement about whether this commemorative is a new memorial or an addition to an already existing one and what standards or restrictions apply to it however the senate has agreed to accept the house language which i think is in the best interests of the groups concerned and the existing law i would like to pay a special tribute once again to the gentleman from connecticut for making us have a conscience about this project and his constant persistence which in the long run did pay off and i want to thank the gentleman very much s 2042 as amended by the house authorizes the vietnam womens memorial project inc to establish a memorial on federal land in the district of columbia or its environs to honor women of the armed forces of the united states who served in the republic of vietnam during the vietnam era to commemorate the dedication and sacrifice that so many women offered our nation is a noble and worthwhile cause over 10 000 woman served in vietnam and through their efforts our wounded were nursed back to health our dying were comforted and our soldiers morale was kept high there is little doubt that the wall of the vietnam vieterans memorial would list thousands of more names if these women had not chosen to serve their willingness to aid our nation in its time of need definitely deserves to be recognized the house of representatives has remained firm in its position of upholding the commemorative works act of 1986 with regards to the authorization of this memorial this law sets forth certain guidelines for the placement of monuments and memorials and its enforcement is essential to preserving the integrity of the districts landscape the other body has argued that the house language does not all under the jurisdiction of the commemorative works act because it is an addition to a memorial rather than a new one the houses response to this argument is that additions to memorials must be reviewed jointly by the house administration and the interior and insular affairs committees when this legislation was introduced it was referred solely to the committee on house administration it was thus inferred that the house administration committee would treat the legislation as a new memorial with the interior committee subsequently handling the siting of the commemorative after the secretary of the interior had made his recommendations the other body suggested that the committee on house administration and the committee on interior and insular affairs be given joint jurisdiction over s 2042 the interior and insular affairs committee has made it clear that they would not intend to move such legislation without hearings of its own additions and alterations are not specifically addressed in the commemorative works act however if this issue is not addressed in the statute itself it is addressed in the spirit of the law it may well be that the issue of additions and alterations to existing memorials needs to be looked al if so it should be done in an open and fair manner a specific process must be set up where such proposals like this can be met at this point we simply cannot circumvent the process there are several other points that i would like to address first the other body has argued that this legislation must be sitespecific because they believe the house language will prevent the womens memorial from being placed in area i let alone the vietnam veterans memorial one source of their concern is that section 6 b 1 of the commemorative works act states a military commemorative work may be established only to commemorate a war or other branch of the armed forces no commemorative work commemorating a lesser conflict or a unit of the armed forces shall be permitted a commemorative honoring women is not necessarily excluded in the language of the commemorative works act while the women who served in vietnam may not constitute a branch of the armed forces their service is by no means limited to a specific unit women have served our country in all branches of the armed forces and in a variety of capacities in recognition of that fact the vietnam nurses memorial project changed its name to the vietnam womens memorial project and revised its statement of purpose to encompass all of those services the other body also argues that the site of the memorial must be legislated because section 7 b 2 of the commemorative works act provides that a new memorial may not encroach upon any existing memorial and the commission of fine arts the national capital planning commission and the sccretary of the interior will therefore be prohibited from agreeing to the placement of the womens memorial at the existing vietnam veterans memorial the question that arises is who should judge whether a new memorial constitutes an encroachment of an existing memorial because the commission of fine arts the ncpc and the secretary of interior handle the site selection process and other judgments of esthetics they also are instilled with the power to decipher what constitutes an encroachment or interference with another memorial the committee feels very strongly that these agencies are the experts on those matters in addition the other body argues against the siting process set up by the commemorative works act under the act the group must return to congress to be authorized for an area i site the other body believes that the commemorative stands little chance of being placed at the vietnam veterans memorial we firmly believe that the commemorative can and will be placed at the vietnam veterans memorial even if the process set up by the commemorative works act is preserved the secretary of the interior has already made it clear that he believes that the vietnam womens memorial is of historical and lasting significance october 8 1987 letter from secretary hodel second because the project enjoys such overwhelming support in both houses of congress authorization for an area i site can be expected to occur quite expeditiously third the commission of fine arts has informed the committee and the vietnam womens memorial project that it is willing to commemorate women at the vietnam veterans memorial and we see no reason to doubt this pledge furthermore because the congress has expressed its sense that it would be fitting and appropriate for this memorial to be located at the vietnam veterans memorial and because the commission of fine arts cannot veto a memorials siting for area i after that commemorative has been authorized by congress for area i and because section 7 b 1 states that a commemorative work shall be located in surroundings that are relevant to the subject of the commemorative work it is our belief that the commission of fine arts would be hardpressed to find a reason not to place the memorial at the vietnam veterans memorial there are so many of my

hearings on military personnel issues at okinawa and clark air base in the philippines the field hearing at clark in particular is one that i will long remember we were at clark only a few weeks after three american servicemen were killed by communist guerrillas in neighboring angeles city as a result we expected a high anxiety level among unitedstates military personnel and their families stationed in the philippines about the possibility of further terrorist attempts on american lives while there clearly was an undercurrent of concern about the terrorist threat the burning issue with our men and women in uniform was the security of their homes and personal possessions against petty larceny by the criminal element in the local filipino population we held the field hearing in the packed base gymnasium that sultry late november evening it was a transfixing experience for all the members present as witness after witness often to tumultuous applause spoke of the daytoday fear of robberies at their quarters on base one tearful enlisted members wife who had recently moved into the base told of her young chllds recurrent nightmares after their onbase quarters were broken into 2 days in a row her 3 2yearold woke up screaming in the night each time their dog barked at a potential intruder in the area our service members are willing to accept the threat of terrorism as one of the risks of their jobbut not the petty thievery that runs rampant they are justifiably outraged that they have to pay protection money to hire filipino guards to protect their personal belongings from the invasion of local nationals who come over the wall as the base perimeter fence is sarcastically called with impunity there is no question about it the current base security situation at clark air base is intolerable in renegotiating the philippine base agreements in the late 1970s the united states relinguished the responsibility for perimeter security to the philippine armed forces unfortunately they have neither the manpower nor equipment to perform the task in addition those local nationals who are apprehended are turned over to a revolvingdoor philippine judicial system in which prosecution much less conviction is a rarity indeed unitedstates military authorities are doing their best to shore up security operations within the base perimeter through increased patrols improved lights and concrete walls the ultimate solution lies in a greater willingness by the philippine government to live up to the terms of their agreement to ensure the security of unitedstates

that occur we must be prepared at some point to say that the price is simply too high as the gentleman from alabama has stated the unitedstates bases in the philippines are importantbut the philippine

one lawyer can always support two we tried when priceanderson was written years ago we tried to take the lawyers out of it it is not a system with long delay not a system where you see all the difficulties you have in the negligence field the law was written so that you could get in and have this insurance pool that is operated fairly well by the major insurance companies you get yourself in this pool and you do not have to have lawyers payment will be made promptly and adequately when three mile island happened the lawyers and the agents who were involved with this who had experience with it were paying money out in pennsylvania to farmers and local residents within a matter of days the problem has had some difficulties some weaknesses but i want to report that the biggest issuein the energy committee and in our committeethe biggest issde was this business of attorneys fees and we heard in our committee from mr sikorskis allies and he very eloquently presented the case when he got to the energy committee and they made some further modifications in the direction needed so you now have in the bill a modified balanced treatment of claims the court is given discretion under prior criteria you can read this in the report pages 121 to 123 i think it is you can read in therethe weapons that they have available in addition to that we raised the limit to 7 billion which insures that there is less likelihood of money not being available to pay the claimsof deserving citizens whohave been damaged in one of these nuclear accidents i am not the authorized spokesman for the administration on these matters but i call to the attention of my colleagues a message which has just come to the speakers desk from the department of energy i will put the entire letter in the record this message is signed by john s herrington the secretary of energy he says i am writing to urge the house to reject any amendments to h r 1414 the priceanderson amendments act of 1987 which may be offered during floor consideration we are particularly concerned about amendments that would reach beyond the basic compensatory purpose of priceanderson and would threaten to undermine the carefully fashioned consensus bill worked out between the three cognizant house committees and the administration the legislation that has been sent to the house floor is the result of three years of extensive hearings discussions and negotiations priceanderson is essential to the continued availability of nuclear power as an energy supply option and as an instrument to facilitate the departments research and national security activities the administration supports reauthorization of priceanderson and supports the bill currently before the full house however we strongly oppose all efforts to add to the bill any provision to impose new liabilities on department of energy doe contractors such as subrogation or penalties to establish unlimited liability in the unlikely event of an accident or to waive the defenses available under the federal tort claims act if such provisions are contained in the bill placed before the president i will recommend to the president that he disapprove the legislation although we share the objective of ensuring that doe contractors conform their conduct to the highest standard of safety and care we are convinced that the inclusion of any subrogation or penalties provision would strongly discourage contractors from commencing or continuing their relationships with the department such noncompensatory provisions would be totally inconsistent with the objectives of priceanderson and would impose severe burdens on the departments research and national security activities we also object to any amendments that would eliminate the socalled limitation on liability by no longer requiring affirmative congressional action to compensate the public when it appears that claims may exceed the statutory cap enactment of the house consensus bill without further amendment would provide the public more than a tenfold increase in the amount of financial protection afforded under current law if the cap were ever exceeded the absence of congressional involvement in the distribution of funds could lead to endless claims on the unitedstates treasury rendering the system of compensation both inefficient and unpredictable in addition to these two provisions the administration strongly opposes any provision which would for liability purposes treat the department as if it were one of its own contractors changing the rules of government liability struck long ago in the federal tort claims act would represent a major departure from existing law upsetting wellestablished principles that have governed this area of law for years in addition to these inimical provisions we are also opposed to any amendment which would restrict payment of defense costs from the compensation fund until all otherclaims are paid defense costs in the unlikely event of an accident are extremely difficult to predict making co verage of such costs under private insurance contracts virtually impossible to obtain coverage of these costs under priceanderson would prevent the inability to obtain such insurance from discouraging the continued operation of nuclear facilities and future investment in such facilities i encourage the house to renew the priceanderson act without counterproductive provisions designed to legislatively address issues that are unrelated to the compensatory objectives of the act what has troubled me during the process of this bill is that there has been a continuing attempt to make a complicated system out of priceanderson which was designed to be a simple system priceanderson you could write on the back of an envelope what it does it says we need nuclear plants it is our national policy to build them we want to assure people living around those plants who live in fear that if an accident happens damages are going to be paid there was a tradeoff here the tradeoff is no fault you do not have to prove fault you get your money for the damage the other part of the bargain apart from no fault is limitation on damages nobody no insurance company is going to pay an unlimited amount under a nofault system so ours is a nofault provision with the sensible limitation on damages we protect the plaintiff the

that there are some 60 000 units out there in inventory which would be rehabilitated or preserved and made habitable for lowincome people to live in our strategy continues to favor this balanced

before us today the conference agreement on h r 5 represents one of the most farreaching education bills of the tecade and i commend the chairn n mr hawkins mr jeffords rnd our colleague from pennsylvania mr goodlin0 for their forward leadership h r 5 makes good on the federal promise to join with states and local school districts in enhancing the quality of our nations elementary and secondary schools it does so by offering a package of prograins that collectively reaffirm the federal commitment to access to quality education for disadvantaged students and other students with special needs i come to you today as a former educator and local school board member i am acutely aware that we must encourage and reward excellence in education and provide assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates h r 5 accomplishes that goal however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education should be a limited one beyond my philosophical opposition to sending tax dollars to washington only to see 60 cents returned it is undeniable that state and local governments are best equipped to know what their particular community needs most local governments can provide the kind of flexibility creativity and attention to detail that is impossible on the federal level the final version of h r 5 includes my amendments on youth suicide prevention the roukema amendments establishes authorized youth suicide prevention programs as allowable prograins under the antidrug abuse act and chapter ii block grant fund the chapter ii block grant which provides money for such programs as early childhood development at risk students schoolwide improvements now includes one more important program suicide prevention let me be clear this does not mandate suicide prevention education this allows suicide prevention programs as an option my amendment allows local schools if they desire to apply chapter ii block grant money to establish needed prograins in youth suicide prevention my own district in northern new jersey was the scene of a terrible tragedy last year we all remember so vividly that four young people took their own lives dramatic evidence of the rising incidence of suicide across the country in the aftermath the community sought funds to develop a program to counsel children teachers and parents however their only recourse was the lengthy difficult process of applying for a federal grant which in the end was denied now i do not want a national competitive grant program to be the only recourse for communities to receive money if they desire my amendment is constructed to give the authority solely to the local entity without imposing the federal qovermients will oi discretion on local agercies it is an eflort to supplement and help schools deal with a tragic problem within their communities if they choose that option the school is the one institution that is the common denominator for all these students the purpose of my amendment is to use the schools to identify highrisk students and to identify them before they drop out in addition our local option provides the opportunity for the community to decide if there is a genuine need principals school teachers and officials who are most sensitive to the specific local circumstances will have the opportunity to establish programs and train personnel there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this bill its scope reaches all ages from early intervention programs for our very young to dropout

tony has spent many years working to protect african elephants and it is a tribute to his dedication that we are considering this bill today during the past 10 years the population of african elephants has declined by nearly 50 percent today fewer than 750 000 african elephants are alive and the destruction of this magnificent animal has not been confined to just a few countries but it is widespread throughout the african continent in fact there are really only three african nationsbotswana zimbabwe and south africawhich have effective elephant conservation programs the rest are fighting and losing the battle against poachers who are now selling illegally obtained ivory at prices which have increased by more than sevenfold during the past decade since 1980 the annual volume of world ivory has been about 800 tons to meet this demand some 70 000 elephants must die each year yet only 3 percent of the ivory imported into the united states comes directly from africa the bulk of it arrives from such intermediary places as hong kong china and japan traders in these countries make millions by carving poached ivory and frankly i cannot understand why we just dont tell people they can no longer sell their illegally obtained ivory here in the united states a a nation we consume about 30 percent of the world ivory production each year since most experts believe that nearly 80 percent of all ivory is poached purchases in the united states account for the death of some 27 000 african elephants every year with the population of african elephants declining by nearly 9 percent a year unless this slaughter is stopped the african elephant will be annihilated within the next decade as someone who has been a sportsman all of his life i learned early on to have a great appreciation and love for all of gods creatures i want to see all species preserved not because i want to hunt a certain animal but because i want others to be able to experience as i have the joy of seeing these animals in their natural habitat like tony beilenson i have a particular fondness for elephants and strongly believe the united states should take a leadership role in trying to protect this magnificent species in fact i have been led to believe that if the united states were to take meaningful action much of europe would follow our lead having said that let me briefly share with you my thoughts on h r 2999 as amended by the merchant marine and fisheries committee in a positive sense i am pleased that this legislation contains language exempting legitimate sport trophies from any moratorium the secretary may place on a particular country this language is critically important because without the vital infusion of capital that sport hunters provide there would be no incentive to protect these elephants based on my experience there is no question that if the african elephant which is now a valuable commodity no longer has any financial value then african governments will simply stop spending their meager resources to protect them as a result these elephants will be slaughteredeven in places like botswana and zimbabwefor meat and for the illegal ivory trade sport hunted ivory which is a minuscule percentage of ivory exports is biologically sound and it produces by far the greatest economic return for the producing nation it is also appropriate that this legislation contains a provision which allows the secretary of the interior to accept and use any money donated by individuals for african elephant conservation programs i am confident that the hunting and conservation community which has spent millions of dollars to help protect the black rhino jaguar and many other species will do whatever it can to help save the african elephant in addition i am pleased that this bill does not create a new excise tax on elephant ivory or hides and that it does not allow individuals to file endless litigation against the department of the interior in the form of citizen suits while these are all positive improvements from the socalled staff draft which was the subject of a hearing on wednesday june 22 unfortunately this bill is not without its flaws let me just highlight a few of my concerns first this bill and the moratorium section in particular grants far too much discretion to the department of the interior the authors of this bill obviously have a lot more confidence in the fish and wildlife service than i do to be candid they have done an abysmal job enforcing many of our wildlife protection laws including the lacey act which requires the country of origin to be listed for all wildlife imports in just one month april of this year 335 901 grams of ivory jewelry and carvings and 60 278 separate elephant items were imported into the united states the overwhelming majority of these 124 shipments originated from hong kong ten of the shipments were admitted with the country of origin listed as unknown which is patently illegal and several shipments of elephant shoes listed mexico as the country of origin if we accomplish nothing else in this process i would hope that the fish and wildlife service would begin to refuse to accept any imports without proper countryoforigin documentation and that they will utilize the full range of our wildlife laws to help save the african elephant it is interesting to note that during our june 22 hearing i asked the fish and wildlife service whether they now have the power to establish a selected ban on intermediary and elephant producing nations they responded that they did have such authority but that the added emphasis of national legislation would be most helpful here is that national legislation let us hope the fish and wildlife service will now issue effective and meaningful elephant protection regulations second i am disappointed that this entire bill is based on the premise that ws should wait and see what comes out of the cites conference next year while i am a strong supporter of cites the secretary of the interior should decide prior to the conference which producing and intermediary countries will be allowed to continue importing ivory into the united states there is nothing unique about the type of information cites collects and in fact it is readily available more importantly we have a unique opportunity to influence the cites conference by taking positive steps to help protect african elephants as the first nation to ratify cites and as the chairman of the standing committee we have the responsibility of providing effective leadership in this matter postponing decisions until after cites is a mistake and a missed op portunity if we wait for cites and its ivory control system which monitors only 22 percent of the international ivory trade to become effective then the african elephant will cease to exist in a viable sense in most nations throughout africa i intend to vote in favor of h r 2999 while this bill doesnt go far enough to stop the destruction of the african elephant it is a step in the right direction i would hope that after the cites conference next year the house merchant marine and fisheries committee will revisit this issue and will enact much tougher measures against those countries which sanction and benefit from the poaching of elephants it is time we went after intermediaries like hong kong whose ivory dealers are making a fortune from the illegal ivory trade we must eliminate the financial incentive that poachers now have to kill an elephant if we are ever going to have any hope of saving this species if we want to be successful we should start caring a little more about the elephant and a lot less about ivory merchants in hong kong tokyo and dubai"],

needed to restore our nation to a position of leadership in space it has been a tough 2 years and more since the challenger tragedy and subsequent setbacks with unmanned launch vehicles dealt double blows to our space program but adversity in this case has strengthened rather than defeated us and has lent new resolve to the men and women harged with carrying out our goals no longer are we reliant on a single system for access to space as this bill makes clear we are restoring and strengthening the space shuttle system while providing the necessary alternative launch systems to ensure redundancy in our capabilities the result will be a better more diverse and more reliable unitedstates space program i was privileged to serv earlier this year as chairman of a republican task force on space technology at the johnson space center and there is no doubt in my mind that the future economic and political strength of our nation requires us to take the lead in the exploration and development of space and thats what this bill sets out to do h r 4561 sets forth clear and specific gopals for our space program over the next several years and lays the groundwork for achieving ever more significant goals in the coming decades these goals are first to establish a core space program to put in place reliable transportation systems to earth orbit a permanent manned space station to utililize the unique environment of earth orbit and the technological tools to benefit from that infrastructure if i may use an historical analogy its like the decision of our loaders in the 19th century to extend a basic transportation system the railroad across the continent to open up the vast lands and resources of the american west or the decision of a more recent administration and congress to construct a vast reliable network of interstate highways which revolutionized commnrce and social cohesion for our nation the systems authorized in this bill will provide the same framework and impetus for technological and social progress in the coming years and can be seen as an investment in our future economic and social wellbeing the longrange goals in this bill to extend

presentation of what the economic impact of all of this really is many of my colleagues have already stated and later in the day will again point out the absurday and lack of effectiveness of this r ential weapons system let us focus on the dollars however general abrahamson who is the director of the strategic defense initiative office has stated clearly and without equivocation that over the next 5 years there will be a need to authorize and appropriate 45 billion just to determine at the end of that expenditure whether it is even feasible to go forward or not so we will be expected to pump in 45 billion additional over a 5year period just to determine that question one does not have to be a brilliant mathematician to understand the economic budgetary implication of that that means that we will have to spend approximately 9 billion per year for the next 5 years just to get to answer the question of feasibility my colleagues and i operate within the confines of the gestalt the total of our budget we are here charged with the responsibility of determining priorities we are operating within the statutory constraints of grammrudman which requires that we deal with the deficit

again states that if we go forward with phase 1 and we are going to demonstrate during the course of time that we command the time on this floor that we are talking about maybe a 30percenteffective

only defend nuclear weapons and only do that to the degree of 30 percent effectiveness 9 billion per year for the next 5 years will decimate us 75 to 150 billion with a megabilliondollar deficit will

its will on minorities in the case of indian tribes this has been the rule more often than the exception sadly the courts and congress have fashioned theories and passed laws to rationalize the actions of the majority and to attempt to reconcile them with the tenets of our democratic traditions it is often left to this distinguished body to correct what we now perceive to be the injustices of our nations past recently the congress passed and the president signed a bill to provide redress to our citizens of japanese ancestry who were interned during world war ii we took this action notwithstanding the fact that at the time the supreme court in korematsu versus united states held that the federal governments actions were proper simply put we passed this law because we feel now that the actions taken by our government were wrong as vicechairman of the select committee on indian affairs i have had the opportunity to help restore to indian tribes some of the land and other rights taken from them these actions often are taken long after the injustices occurred and in many instances even after the courts and prior congresses have fashioned theories to deny recovery today i am introducing legislation to correct an inequity wrought upon the people of the quinault indian reservation of washington state this inequity resulted from a surveying error dating back to 1892 that excluded 15 000 acres of land from the quinault indian reservation the legislation authorizes the return of a portion of the landthat is now administered by national forest serviceto the quinault indian nation mr president the genesis of this controversy goes back nearly 150 years in 1855 the quinault indians and several other tribes signed a treaty with the unitedstates government under article ii of the treaty with the quinault 12 stat 971 also known as the treaty of olympia the signatory tribes reserved from their aboriginal homelands land sufficient for their wants within the territory of washington to be selected by the president of the united states and hereafter surveyed or located and set apart for their exclusive use i as a result the superintendent of indian affairs for the washington territory established the quinault hoh and quileute indian reservations along the washington coast originally 10 000 acres were set aside for use by the quinault indians and aboriginal people who have occupied that area for centuries in response to an 1872 recommendation president grant set aside an additional 180 000 acres of land the executive order included a description of the new reservation boundary which ran in part northerly around the east shore of quinault lake to the northwest point thereof thence in a direct line to a point a half mile north of the queetshe river and 3 miles above its mouth when the reservation was first surveyed in the 1890s an error was made in defining the orientation of the lakes axis referred to in the boundary description there was also uncertainty over where the northwest corner of the lake actually was located contemporary correspondence indicates that two points were identified as possibilities for the northwest corner of the lake the local indian agent and the commissioner of indian affairs both recognized that the more northern corner of the two points was the proper northwest corner of the lake under the executive order however these two men recommended that a more southern point be used to establish the reservation boundary to avoid inconveniencing a number of nonindian settlers who had taken up claims along the shore of the lake between 1873 and 1892 these series of events resulting in establishing an incorrect northern boundary line for the quinault reservation as a result the quinault indians were denied the enjoyment and benefits of approximately 15 000 acres that we now know should have been included in their reservation in 1897 president cleveland reserved a large tract of forest land adjacent to the quinault reservation which later became the olympic national forest the boundary of the olympic national forest is defined as the north boundary of the quinault reservation president clevelands executive order did not indicate any intent to impinge upon the quinault reservation or for that matter to clarify the location of its northern boundary following passage of the indian claims act in 1925 the quinault nation filed a claim for the north boundary lands erroneously excluded by the 1892 reservation survey the court of claims in two decisions quinaielt sic tribe of indians v united states 102 ct ci 822 1945 and 118 ct ci 220 1951 reviewed the history of the boundary dispute in both cases the court agreed with the qulnault people that their reservation boundary was erroneously surveyed in 1892 in retrospect it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the court of claims was determined to deny recovery for the erroneous survey an initial appeal by the united states from the first court of claims decision questioned the quinault tribes right to recover because the executive order language specified the reservation for the use of the qulleute hoh queets and other tribes to clarify the situation congress enacted a statute that declared the quinault tribe on behalf of all indians having an interest in the quinault reservation the proper party to pursue the claim for the excluded north boundary lands that done the tribe continued to pursue its claim in its second decision the court of claims reasoned that the land was inaccessible at the time of the boundary survey and therefore the timber growing on the land had no value the court found that the raw land some 15 928 acres at the time of taking had a value of 25 000 or a little over 1 50 per acre adding insult to injury the court of claims held that damages for the tribe resulting from the loss of the land was offset by payments and gratuities provided by the united states to the quinault tribe since the treaties were signed therefore the case was dismissed without any recovery tragically for the quinault people congress later repealed the law requiring consideration of payments and gratuities mr president another law passed by congress has had a devastating effect on tribes and reservations throughout indian country the general allotment act of 1887 also known as the dawes act granted allotments to individual indians with excess lands opened for sale to nonindiansresulting in further losses of land by the tribes later the general allotment act was amended to prohibit further sale of indian land as a result individual indians could inherit fractionalized interests in allotments but could not sell them over time the continued division of ownership as a result of inheritance has made ownership practically meaningless the quinault tribe suffered greatly under the dawes act today the 190 000 acre quinault reservation is a patchwork of individual indian tribal and nonindian ownership less than 4 percent of the reservation is owned by or held in trust for the quinault nation this pattern has fostered controversy and conflict while precluding the effective management of forest resources on the reservation by the bureau of indian affairs economic development opportunities have been splintered much like the land parcels of the reservation are now splintered based on 1980 census data the average annual per capita income of the indian residents of the quinault reservation is 3 182 many owners of allotments receive quarterly checks from the bia of less than 1 according to bureau of indian affairs labor force statistics unemployment runs almost 30 percent the quinaults land base and their ability to provide a strong economy has been harshly eroded and with it the integrity of the federal governments trust responsibility to these native americans has been undermined mr president congress often considers the claims of indian tribes that date back to an earlier time when we do so however we must also be cognizant of the rights and settled expectations of those nonindians who relied upon earlier court decisions and congressional acts i believe that this bill does that the legislation is carefully crafted to minimize and in most cases to avoid altogether any adverse impacts upon those who have relied on this land for their economic livelihood timber harvest will continue under the same rules as in the past and will not disrupt the proportionate share of revenues the counties of the olympic peninsula receive from federal timber harvest activities the timber production potential of the quinault reservation and the accompanying economic development opportunities that are so desperately needed cannot be realized under current conditions if the lands of the reservation can be effectively managed in a coordinated fashionand i am confident the quinault nation has the intent and the expertise to do just thatthe tribal economy should prosper and will likely have positive impacts on the local timber supply and regional economy i believe another longterm objective will also be realized a strong tribal economy will curtail the escalating costs of federally administering the fractionalized land passage of this bill will provide the quinault tribe with badly needed financial resources consolidate its land base and restore the reservations depleted and mismanaged forest resources i have received letters in recent weeks from the port of grays harbor wa grays harbor county and public timber purchasers testifying to the fact that they will not oppose this legislation these letters are a testament to the heightened sensitivity of the people of washington state toward the concerns of their indian neighbors i am pleased by their response to the initiative of the quinault people and i am proud to represent a state where such a spirit of cooperation exists mr 1 esident i have heard it said that the essence of what we do here in congress is to put words around our emotions and call them laws these laws both legislative and courtmade often reflect the spirit of the times as our emotions change and our understanding of what is morally and fundamentally right evolves so must our laws reflect this heightened understanding by mr pell for himself and mr gore s j res 368 joint
