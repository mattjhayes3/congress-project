interests of rural america i must rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa and urge my colleagues to instead support the obey substitute that will be offered today after the next amendment to this bill let me thank the gentleman from iowa for doing the best that he could inside his own caucus he is a member of our subcommittee and i know how deeply he feels these issues but truly i would say to his leadership this is not the way for america to deal with the crisis affecting unitedstates citizens our farmersfrom coast to coast west to east north to south why should we even consider an amendment here today which deals with such a teensyweensy portion of a massive problem as part of an emergency supplemental dealing with kosovo we considered this bill dealing with rural america in the house several weeks ago nearly 2 months ago and then something happened over in the other body and the leadership of both institutions were not able to get themselves together and i would have to say to my dear friend fromflorida this is not his fault either he has my sympathy because i understand a little bit about florida and that 175 runs between ohio and florida so a lot of our people go down there during the winter and come back and the gentleman has tried to do the best that he can under constraints that are being applied by the leadership of this house and the leadership of the other body it kind of reminds me of that old song by peggy lee when i look at this amendment is that all there is and when we look at the actual content of the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa he has been cut back by his own leadership to only include a small portion of agricultural credit that is desperately needed by our farmers toget through this spring plonting season however even the administrations abysmal request to this congress included funding for the staff to administer that that is not in the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa mr lathamx ag credit money that will unleash dollars in the private sector will not help farmers in this crisis because we need people to deliver the assistance and we know that because of the depth of this crisis in our country the disaster payments from last year have not even been fully processed and what has our secretary of agriculture been doing he has been robbing one account over there to pay for another account just to try to k eep staff people in place in these farm service agencies around the country and last week all authority ran out so the robpetertopaypaul mechanism that has been used because we have not been able to clear a bill because of the backwardness of the leadership of this institution now places the burden on the gentleman from iowa a respected member of our subcommittee who is trying to do the best he can but i would like to ask where is the leadership of this house and where is the leadership of the other body to give the farmers of this country that we owe such a debt of gratitude to for keeping this nation fed food security fundamental to any body politics peace why can they not get their day in the sun why do we get backdoored at the end in the last file in the cabinet in a bill dealing with kosovo and we cannot even deal with the enormity of this problem what kind of signal does the gentlemans amendment also give to farmers because in that particular amendment we basically have to offset the 109 million that he is talking about and why is the crisis in rural america any less of a crisis than what we are facing in kosovo in a foreign land or hurricane mitch what about the people of this country i do not think i am xenophobic i care very much about this country the people of this country elected me to be here andi think they should be at the front of the line not at the back of the file cabinet so i view what is happening in rural america a true emergency we are now into day 69 of this congress and we cannot even get a debate in here about the dimensions of people who are going bankruptfrom coast to coast so with all due respect to the gentleman from iowa i think he has done the best job he can do with this amendment but if people in this body really want to help rural america we ought to vote no on the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa and yes on the obey substitute and truly ask the leadership of this institution to bring up a freestanding bill that is an emergency for the people of this country who are trying to feed us and the world and are being ignored at the highest levels of this legislative body i just say that in the obey substitute that will be offered we not only deal with agricultural credit the full amount asked for by the administration we ask for sufficient funds for people to administer that credit at our farm service agencies we also deal with the three major credit programs in his amendment we talk about emergency assistance for farm workers we have special aid to those who produce hogs around this country who literally are on their knees also our emergency conservation programs are attended to livestock assistance for those affected by disasters our watershed and flood prevention programs our rural water and sewer grants rural housing and even food aid for kosovo refugees 175 million in mr obeys substitute with the surpluses we have on our backs here and with hungry people there what a winwin for everyone why can we not get a freestanding vote on the needs of rural america in this chamber so i know the gentleman from iowa"], [0.4477335214614868, 0.4477335214614868, 0, "tonight we are going to talk about an issue which i suspect most of our colleagues and anyone else who might be watching on cspan tonight would say how in the world can the issue of milk be a controversial issue i think if they pay any attention tonight they will find that milk is an enormously controversial issue particularly for those of us in the upper midwest it is a very difficult issue i think for the average person to completely understand and we hope that we do not bore our colleagues who may be watching tonight it is a little like the story of the little boy who came in and asked his mother a question his mother was kind of busy and she said well why dont you ask your dad the little boy said well i didnt want to know that much about it i suspect a lot of people who may tune in tonight may say well i did riot want to know that much about milk policy here in the united states to start off though i think we have to kind of look at this chart and begin to understand the history first of all let me say that this is june it is dairy month some people know that a lot of people do not know that but june is dairy month for a very interesting reason back in the thirties farmers recognized that in june we reach what is called the peak of the spring flush that is when dairy cows produce the most amount of milk they are going to produce all year at the same time schools get out a lot of kids go home they drink less milk more soft drinks more lemonade and so forth and so at the very time milk production goes to its peak consumption drops back in the thirties the chain drugstore association got together with the dairy association and had the first dairy month now it has become a very big event particularly in the upper midwest and we encourage people all over the country to enjoy milk but more importantly cheese and cottage cheese and yogurt ice cream all the other things made from the real thing dairy products real cheese real milk back in the thirties we were suffering from some rather difficult financial circumstances for all americans but for farmers in particular and they came up with a rather convoluted system back in 1937 as part of the agricultural marketing agreement in 1937 to create various regions around the country and price milk based on where it came from and what it went into we are going to talk about this whole issue a little bit tonight but i want to talk about the disparities that this system is creating this is the 1998 average blend prices for current federal milk marketing orders what it demonstrates and i think the numbers may be too small to really pick up on the television screen so any of the members who may be watching in their offices who would like a smaller version of this so that they can actually look at it and read the numbers i am going to read some of them for you but in effect what we have is a system where milk is priced to the dairy farmer based on what it goes into and where it comes from now this may seem bizarre but in 1937 eau claire wisconsin was considered the epicenter of the dairy production area in the united states anybody who has ever watched a green bay packers game understands that there is an awful lot of cheese produced in wisconsin there is also a lot of cheese produced in my district as a matter of fact there is one cheese plant in my district that produces 500 000 pounds of cheese every single day that is a lot of cheese and of course we cannot eat all of that cheese in the upper midwest but what they did is they created this system because they decided that eau claire wisconsin was the epicenter of the dairy production area for the united states they said the closer you are to eau claire wisconsin the less you will get for your milk because of all the cheese plants and because back in 1937 we did not have the interstate highway system and refrigerated trucks it probably made some sense back in 1937 to have a system so that it would encourage production in places like texas los angeles the pacific northwest particularly out here in the populated areas of the eastern seaboard boston new york washington they wanted to encourage more dairy production in those areas relative to wisconsin minnesota northern illinois and iowa so they came up with this rather convoluted system which may have made some sense in 1937 but guess what since 1937 we built the interstate highway system we have refrigerated trucks that can now get milk almost anywhere in the united states within a matter of a few days while the milk is still absolutely fresh delicious and wonderful to enjoy but we still have the system it is interesting once you create a federal government program in fact mark twain once observed the most permanent thing on earth is a temporary government program back in 1937 they created this system and to give you some of the numbers that are shown on this chart to kind of give you an idea of the differences the average blended price for the upper midwest including minnesota most of wisconsin the eastern dakotas part of northern iowa and i think it actually gets into northern illinois the average blended price last year that was paid to dairy farmers was 13 57 per hundred pounds of milk now that is another thing most people do not understand the dairy farmer always receives his milk check based on the number of hundreds of pounds of milk so the average dairy farmer in the upper midwest got 13 57 that was what the federal government mandated mandated is an important word we are going to talk about that a little bit now if you were a dairy farmer for example in washington or oregon the federal government mandated a price of 14 75 if you were in central arizona that price was 14 90 but if you lived down here in the southeast one of the states that produced milk for example in southern tennessee mississippi alabama georgia that dairy farmer got 16 13 mandated by the federal government if you lived in southern florida for example down in the tampa bay region your price was 16 82 the differential 13 57 if you live in my district or wisconsin or parts of illinois 13 57 but if you are down in florida it is 16 82 again that may have made sense back in 1937 when we did not have the interstate highway system did not have refrigerated trucks but it does not make a whole lot of sense today so we are here tonight to talk about this and sort of raise some of the questions rhetorical questions and ask if anybody can honestly defend a system that says to dairy farmers that your product will be based on where it comes from and what it goes into incidentally to make things even more complicated yes milk is priced based on what it goes into if your milk goes into fluid milk the stuff that comes in containers that you drink and everybody loves good for your body gives you a white mustache if it goes into fluid milk it is worth more than if it is going into what is called class 2 milk which is spoonable that would include ice cream cottage cheese yogurt class 3 milk is products like cheese and butter class 4 milk is powdered milk so we have four classes of milk and again that determines the price that the dairy farmer gets that does all of the work that gets up every morning at 5 oclock in the morning because cows have to be milked at least twice a day this is not a job for the faint of heart anybody who wants to go into the dairy business see me because there are lots of people looking for folks who want to get up at 5 oclock every single morning 365 days a year and milk those cows that is what they have to do but the real problem is if you live in minnesota wisconsin what we call the upper midwest region the eastern dakotas you get 13 57 if you live in southern florida you get 16 82 now is it any wonder that some of our producers in the upper midwest say this is not fair it is absolutely not fair that is a system that we hope to change i started this conversation tonight by saying you would not think that milk is a particularly controversial issue well it is because believe it or not the people in florida think this is a pretty good system what is wrong with the system that pays our dairy farmers 16 82 in fact i am in my third term in congress i have learned in those three terms that whenever you talk about leveling the playing field you can always bet that at least half of the people participating in that debate do not want to level the playing field why because relatively speaking their constituents lose well the point that we have been making in the upper midwest since 1937 now let me do a little arithmetic it is now 1999 less 37 that amounts to what 62 years for 62 years the dairy farmers in our region have been receiving less money relative to dairy farmers in anywhere else in the united states so for 62 years we have been saying it is time to level the playing field i have got another chart here and again if anyone would like a copy of these charts we would be more than happy to send them out if you contact my office we will send them to you but this gives some idea of the producer class 1 blended price benefit a regional average it shows how the differences work out between the northeast the average what the average is in the appalachian region florida for example as i mentioned you can see by this bar chart florida receives the best of all the deals and unfortunately the region that we represent is down here way at the bottom again we are not asking for special privileges we are not asking for special favors but we are asking in the day and age when we have the interstate highway system we have refrigerated trucks all we are asking is for equal pay for equal milk i have joining me tonight a couple of my colleagues one from illinois and one from the state of wisconsin and i want to yield some time to my colleague a freshman member the gentleman from wisconsin from i believe the first congressional district i represent the first congressional district in minnesota the gentleman from wisconsin represents the first congressional district in wisconsin i wonder if you want to talk a little bit about this and what the dairy farmers are talking about and ultimately the unfairness of the system we have"], [0.448451429605484,

country a great american a gr eat crew chief in vietnam i have been down in the contrawars with my great friend the gentleman from texas a wonderful wonderful member of our committee i also respect the gentleman from ohio and what he is trying to do and i just want to point out a few things we have already entered the drug war with the unitedstates military we entered the drug war because we realized that our customs folks and our other folks were being overwhelmed by what essentially were military operations on the side of the people that were moving cocaine and other narcotics to our children into the unitedstates so we st arted using american military assets even though there was a major debate 15 years ago on this subject this is only permissive it requires the request of the attorney general of the united states and the secretary of the treasury and even then it is not mandatory it is discretionary with dod i would say if we look at the enormous effectiveness of the smugglers people who are moving now both people and narcotics into this country and the prospect and possibility of terrorism which always exists this is not an unusual or an extreme request it requires a request from the attorney general of the united states and in some cases with this 2 000 mile border and an underfunded border patrol which is stretched very thin and which even today cannot meet its recruiting requirements it is very obvious it is very easy to envision a time when the united states in its interests its preservation interests and security interests should have the right to have american troops on the border i do not think it is an outrageous request and i think it is something that we should be able to have at least in our hip pocket i would just ask my friends i joined with them on all of these requests for more border patrol funding and i led some of those requests the ins has not gone along with those requests we are still short border patrol agents i

and appreciate the speakers indulgence and other members who are listening tonight i always try to come before the house on tuesday nights during these special orders to bring to the attention of the members of the house of representatives the congress and also the american people the number one social problem that we face and that isthe problem of drug abuse illegal narcotics and drug addiction in this country over and over i have repeated some of the statistics and the statistics are mind boggling the national office of drug control policy and our drug czar barry mccaffrey have estimated that each year over 52 000 americans die directly and indirectly as a result of narcotics abuse in this country that in the last recorded report to the congress in 1998 in fact 15 973 americans lost their lives as a direct result of narcotics abuse i have not yet seen the 1999 figures but i am sure they are even worse the situation is basically out of control with 70 percent of those behind bars in our prisons and jails incarcerated across this land are there because of some drug related offense the cost to our economy is in the quarter of a trillion dollars a year range the destruction of lives not only lost but those left behind in families torn apart in the agony of drug abuse an addiction that so many families have experienced is devastating almost every report that we have that comes before us today in our media the account of a 6 year old killing a 6 year old drugs were at the heart of the problem of that family and that 6 year old coming from a crack house a 12 year old taking a gun to school and threatening his classmates wanted to be with his mother who was in jail on a prison charge a 17 year old who attacks at the national zoo during the recent holidays crowds of people innocent bystanders he comes from a family involved in drugs a father and gangs involved in illegal narcotics this story goes on and on we can place the blame on a weapon or something else but we do not pay attention as i have stated before to the root problem in many many of these instances which is illegal narcotics drug abuse and addiction tonight i want to pick up from spread of heroin has also affected other where i left off last week and talk a bit parts of our population that have realabout some of the impact of illegal ly not seen the ill effects of heroin in narcotics now we know in our land the past this headline is from may 9 that nearly half of americans have in usa today and it says heroins retried some type of form of illegal nar surgence closing gender gap this arcotic and we know that in fact using ticle says that girls are now becoming some illegal drugs such as marijuana the victims again previously this does lead to use of other types of ille was limited

a multifaceted basis we are starting to address this but nonethe0 2310 less there is an incredible explosion of most people did not pay attention to use among the female population and it also among the youth population but in 7 short years of this adminis i also began a week or two ago citing tration we have seen the tide of heroin part of a report and i wanted to refer coming into our states from the for to it tonight it is an interagency doeign production predominantly colom mestic heroin threat assessment that bia in unprecedented quantities in just came out about a month or two fact in 19921993 the beginning of this ago from the national drug inteladministration there was almost no ligence center in johnstown pennsylproduction of heroin in the country of vania that interagency domestic drug colombia and today colombia ac assessment had some interesting new counts for 75 percent of the heroin data that i would like to make part of that heroin is finding its way into our the record tonight and also call to the streets and our neighborhoods our attention of the american people and schools and now our yoang population the congress i have a copy of a recent may 8 head first of all this report talked about line and it says suburban teen heroin heroin use in the united states of use on the rise so what was confined america and particularly in the west to our inner cities what was confined according to the drug abuse warning to hard addicts is now really becoming network which is also known as a plague upon our teenagers and those dawn heroinrelated emergency dein our suburban communities partment mentions in the western in my area of central florida we united states increased some 28 perhave had headlines that have blurted cent in recent years heroinrelated out that heroin overdose deaths and deaths between 1993 and 1996 rose in all drug deaths now exceed homicides and 12 states of the western region during the same unfortunately is true in that time frame in oregon the state many other areas of our land medical examiners office reports an part of this article which is just sev average of five people a week died of eral weeks old says and let me quote heroinrelated causes in the first 6 heroin is back its cheaper more po months of 1999 tent and more deadly than ever said to further look at some of the more bob weiner an aide to white house recent statistics and data in this redrug policy director barry mccaffery port and again focusing on the western and what he is saying is in fact thavz part of the united states the report the heroin on our streets today as op says that seizures at the southwest posed to the heroin in the 1970s even border increased from 52 events and the 1980s is of a much purer much 103 8 kilograms seized in 1997 to 80 more deadly content sometimes reach events and 145 9 kilograms in 1998 ing 70 80 percent purity what is interesting about the heroin in my area in particular they are get that we see coming in from this area is ting very pure heroin and that is dead not only do we have the colombian ly heroin that is why it is killing our heroin that almost did not exist at the young people and others in such incred beginning of this administration we ible numbers now have in double digits very strong unfortunately this report talks very pure very deadly black tar heroin about teenagers but in fact the coming from mexico mexico in fact and not too many people will publicize this particularly at a sensitive time with elections in mexico and elections in the united states but from 1997 to 1998 in the most recent statistics we have of heroin seized in the united states mexican black tar deadly heroin has increased some 20 percent in just a 1year period again a dramatic increase in heroin coming from our neighbor to the south according to the drug abuse warning network again the acronym dawn heroinmorphine related emergency department mentions in the southern united states increased 165 percent between 1990 and 1997 heroinrelated drug treatment admissions in the southern united states increased 13 percent between 1992 and 1997 according to dawns treatment episode data report heroin use in the north central united states is also on the increase so this is not just a regional problem a limited regional problem to florida and the southeast or the southwest but this report also details what is going on in the north central states heroinmorphine related emergency department mentions increased some 225 percent in the major cities in the north central united states in the period between 1990 and 1997 chicago heroinmorphine related incidents increased 323 percent in that same period st louis morphine and heroinrelated deaths increased some 350 percent from 105 in 1990 to 472 in 1997 and then this report also details the northeast united states statistics and what is been happening with heroin in that area of the country according to this report heroinrelated emergency department admissions increased 116 percent between 1990 and 1997 in the northeast united states heroinrelated drug treatment administrations increased 50 percent between 1992 and 1997 according to the dawn episode data report the most significant increase according to this report was in buffalo new york where heroinrelated emergency department mentions increased some 344 percent from 106 in 1990 to 471 in 1997 i think a very interesting report that does show the dramatic increase of drug use and abuse particularly heroin across the united states and that deadly substance and what its effect is having in cities that my subcommittee has examined is quite remarkable i want to use tonight the example again of baltimore maryland our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources recently conducted an oversight and investigations hearing in baltimore baltimore is really one of the most historic and beautiful cities on our eastern coast and baltimore for nearly a decade had a mayor with a very liberal attitude towards illegal narcotics a liberal needle exchange program a lack of enforcement of narcotics laws that are on the books of not only baltimore but also this state of maryland and a lack of cooperation in going after drug users and abuser that type of action has related in an incredible record of drug addiction in baltimore baltimore is an example of a city whose population has gone down down and down from over 900 000 to somewhere in the 600 000 range while the addiction population has gone from somewhere about 39 000 in 1996 to some estimated 70 0 00 or 80 000 in fact one of the city council members was recently quoted saying that one in eight individuals citizens of baltimore are now addicted and primarily to heroin this is a city whose experiment is a failure this is a mayor whose legacy is death and destruction and addiction if this was replicated across the united states we would have tens and tens of millions of our population addicted again a liberal policy possibly well intended but the liberalization in fact did not work and it has addicted an incredible percentage of the population of baltimore i am pleased that after the hearing that we conducted there and after the testimony of the police chief the police commissioner of the city of baltimore who really had a lackadaisical attitude towards enforcement and going after open air drug markets and after his testimony was heard by the mayor and others that he was in fact dismissed it is my hope that the new mayor mayor omalley and i am pleased to see that he is considering a new policy a cleanup campaign for baltimore that i hope will be unprecedented baltimore has suffered this level of addiction has also consistently experienced a high level of deaths per population over 300 deaths in each of the last 3 years in baltimore and we compare that to new york city some 650 670 deaths the last several years new york city with a zero tolerance policy has cut the murders by some 60 percent they cut the overall top felony record in that city by some 58 percent with mayor rudy giulianis zerotolerance policy but in fact baltimorc is an example of a city who attempted a severe legalization and liberalization of drugs and experienced in fact an unmitigated disaster that is a little bit of where we are and an update of what is happening with the heroin across our land again i would like to point out to my colleagues and the american people that in fact we know what does work in the area of drug abuse i am sure the liberal colleagues all choke when they see this chart come up because the chart is probably the most graphic evidence of a policy of success in the reagan and bush administration when there was a real multifaceted war on illegal narcotics when we had source country programs an andean strategy devised under the reagan administration a vice presidential task force these lines on the chart in fact show lead by former vice president bush in the trends here with illegal narcotics which they went after illegal narcotics use this line the top line is lifetime as they were leaving the source coun use the red center line is annual use tries in a tough interdiction policy the third line is 30 day use utilizing in fact in a war against drugs again if we take this back to the all the resources of the united states reaganbush era we are coming with a and we see that in the reagan adminis reduction in 1992 with the election of tration thepresident clinton with the justand again this is untouched i have saymaybe with the appointment of a only added the names of the adminis surgeon general the chief health offitration and put a little divider in here cer of the united states saying justto show where they began and ended saymaybe with a white house which but you see a successful multifaceted had so many people in its employ that war on narcotics again the source had recent drug abuse histories and country reduction interdiction use of problems that the secret service inall of our resources in that effort a sisted on a drug testing program that president that said in fact we will was one of the reasons that they in fact have a full war on drugs two presi wanted to do away with some of the dents that said that and we see the background checks for white house success employees is because they were not now many will tell you that the war passing them and only after the secret on drugs is a failure but i submit that service insisted on instituting a drug the war on drugs began failing at the testing program for white house embeginning of the clinton administra ployees did we see any change there tion when we saw the dismantling of but in fact some of these people were the source country programs the gut setting the policy ting of the andean strategy the dis you see again upward movement in mantling of use of the military against all of these areas through the clinton illegal narcotics the closedown of sur administration of 12th graders in drug veillance operations that provided in use here again you see the leveling off formation to our allies in the war on the beginning of the period in which drugs so we see the total failure and the republicans took control of both the very direct closedown of a war on the house and the senate and some of drugs the efforts that were put into place in if you want to talk about a war on restarting some of those programs so drugs that was a success you need only you see a beginning of a leveling off in look at the reagan bush era if you that period look at when you had a failure on the this again is a statistic that i cited war of drugs it is when you dismantle tonight in the news report about suburpiece by piece directly the war on ille ban teen heroin use and gave the headgal narcotics line from a few weeks ago this shows the only change we see here is with in 1996 again when we took over the the coming of the republicancon house of representatives the situation trolled the new majority in congress that we inherited as far as suburban that we began putting some of these teen use this is the situation we are programs back together again and we now faced with a flood of heroin comhave only begun to see a leveling off ing in predominantly from colombia with that effort but also from mexico as i mentioned but in fact one of our major prob colombia and mexico are probably two lems is that even authorizations by the of the crowning failures of this admincongress are ignored by this adminis istration and resulting in the incredtration let me just put up a couple ible volume of heroin coming into the more charts if i may united states tonight i was talking about update time and time again this adminison heroin heroin use and its preva tration has thwarted as i said both lence again you see a leveling and legislative directives and appropriasome decline during the reagan admin tions to stop heroin production in coistration during the bush administra lombia the entire colombia scenario tion you see a concerted effort and a started in 1994 when this administrareduction and then you see a dramatic tion closed off information sharing increase practically off the chart in the with colombia that measure which clinton administration when you do was opposed i must say by even demonot have a multifaceted approach crats and all of the people on my side when you do not stop illegal drugs at of the aisle but it outraged everyone their source or before they come to our vecause it brought an end to informaborders these statistics cite what hap tion sharing with our allies colombia pens and very graphically show why we peru and other countries and was the have an incredible amount of heroin on beginning of the end of a policy that our streets why we have the reports had begun to make some dramatic like i just read changes in colombia if you remember in colombia steps 0 2330 had been taken to dismantle some of the same thing happens with our the drug cartels and we were on our young people this shows 12th grade way to bringing that nation into some drug use the first chart we showed balance all that fell apart with the bewas lifetime prevalence of drug use ginning of ending surveillance informabut each of these charts and each of tion sharing the next mistake by this administration was in fact to decertify colombia without a national interest waiver which meant that even equipment and resources which the congress had appropriated would be denied to colombia in fact when you do not have any war in colombia or effort by the united states to stem the production of illegal narcotics when you do not have equipment and resources going in to that region to eliminate the production of the crop to eliminate the transshipment from the source zone and you do not use the military and others to provide information and surveillance back to the source country to stop the illegal narcotics and interdict them as they come out this is the result that we see is an incredible volume of heroin coming into the united states at lower cost at higher and more deadly purity levels and we see now suburban teen heroin use on a dramatic rise in the united states again it can be traced to colombia and also to mexico another failure in this administrations policy which in fact certified mexico as cooperating when mexico has done everything to the contrary but assist the united states failing to extradite even a single mexican drug dealer after dozens and dozens of extradition requests failing to sign or negotiate a maritime agreement which this congress just several years ago insisted that mexico do as a part of its cooperative effort to eliminate narcotics trafficking failing to allow our agents to adequately arm and protect themselves and also keeping a limit of just a handful of dea agents in that country they do not want drug agents in that country because the corruption from the police level to the presidents office and throughout the states of mexico has in fact run rampant and in fact mexico has thwarted again all of our efforts at enforcement going so far as in the largest operation in the hemisphere probably the history of this hemisphere to go after corrupt money laundering in mexico operation casa blanca where mexican officials threatened the arrest of united states customs officials and others involved in bringing to justice mexican and unitedstates and other banking officials who were involved in that huge money laundering scheme so another failure a failure in colombia now a source of 70 to 80 percent of the heroin again almost zero was produced in 19921993 further mexico after giving mexico incredible trade benefits financial benefits opening our borders to mexico in fact this administration had failed to gain their cooperation in the devastation that is raining on our communities and a 20 percent increase in black tar mexican heroin on our streets in a 1 year period of time as i continue talking about the drug narcotic problem and i focus some on heroin tonight and also on teen use of heroin which we have seen a dramatic increase in and also the tremendous volume of heroin coming across our borders i wanted to report some of the other statistics that we found relating to this new phenomena the number of heroin users in the united states has increased again according to the last chart i showed from 500 000 half a million in 1996 to 980 000 in 1999 and we know exactly where that heroin is coming from we know why that heroin is coming into the united states one of the interesting statistics in this report was that the rate of first use by children age 12 to 17 increased from less than 1 in 1 000 in the 1980s to 2 7 in 1 000 in 1996 firsttime heroin users are getting younger from an average age of 26 years old in 1991 to an average age in 1997 of only 17 years of age again i have cited the failure of this administrations policy in curtailing some 60 70 percent of the heroin coming in which is produced in colombia now and again almost none produced there in 1992 through 1993 17 percent of the heroin in the united states now coming from mexico we know looking at this map we have colombia which is the source of most of the heroin we know that it is leaving this area we also know that since we have instituted very successful programs in peru and bolivia where they have cut coca production and cocaine production by some 50 to 60 percent in this area through a successful program set up by the gentleman from illinois the previous chair of the subcommittee on drug policy those successful programs coupled with the failure of the administrations program to institute the same type of actions in colombia again even though the congress appropriated funds even though the congress directed those programs to take place in colombia we now have some 80 percent of the cocaine produced and coca produced in colombia so we know we need colombia covered as far as surveillance information as far as knowing where drugs are coming from as far as going after drugs at their source unfortunately in may of last year the surveillance flights stopped from our major forward operating location in the caribbean that was in panama and of course the united states it is now history was forced to remove all of its operations turn over 10 billion in assets to panama close down its antinarcotics flights from that area this chart that i have here shows the patchwork that is being put together by the administration in trying to replace what we had in panama panama had a strategic location and could cover all of this region with flights out of that area unfortunately between 1992 and 1999 one of our more recent reports that we requested showed that the administration had cut these flights some 68 percent additionally maritime actions and surveillance operations were cut by some 62 percent so that is why we have a flood of heroin coming into this area we do not have these locations that are starred here and circled here which we intended as substitutes for the panama operation in place or fully operational at this time we have in manta ecuador an air strip we have just signed a 10year agreement after a year delay but unfortunately there is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 million to 100 million in work that has to be done and an outdate of the year 2002 before this operation will become fully capable of functioning we have in curacao and aruba a limited amount of coverage from that location and the star here in el salvador we have no operations in that location we are just in the process of concluding an agreement which must be presented to their legislature when we get through with this we are probably looking at 150 million now we lost 10 billion in assets to panama were kicked basically out of howard air force base so we have no drug operations in that location we only have a fraction of the former drug surveillance flights so there is a fraction of the information getting to stop illegal narcotics of course we know the history of the administration blocking aid and equipment to colombia repeated requests for 5 years to get black hawk helicopters to colombia which can operate in high altitudes eradicate crops go after drug traffickers and we know that the narcotraffickers who were involved in drug production are also financing the civil war in that country in which some 35 000 people have been slaughtered 5 000 police elected officials supreme court members members of their congress have been slaughtered and yet we have not been able to get even basic equipment in there in the form of helicopters that have been promised for some number of years now even when that equipment was delivered at the end of last year after numerous delays it was delivered there without the proper armoring and without the proper ammunition we found that some of the ammunition that we had been requesting for years to get down to colombia to go after the drug traffickers was in fact delivered to the loading dock of the state department during the christmas holidays and now we find even more disturbing that some of the bulk of the ammunition that has been supplied to colombia is outdated possibly dangerous 1952 ammunition that was purchased by the state department in a bungled procurement this is a very sad picture but it is a very true picture of what has taken place again this is not in place this is what is proposed but this accounts for the flood of heroin coming into the united states out of that transit through mexico through the caribbean much of it we found in recent hearings is transshipped through haiti here is another incredible failure of this administration spending some 3 billion one of the most farcical foreign policy adventures in the history of the entire western hemisphere after repeated pleas with president clinton i came to this floor many times saying we cannot impose an economic embargo on a country where people are making less than a dollar a day where the country is basically operating with 60 000 to 80 000 manufacturing jobs by unitedstates businesses who have invested in that country imposing an embargo that closed down industry manufacturing private sector activity through the entire population on to a clintonstyle welfare program which we are now supporting and haiti is a country in which taxpayers of the united states not only got into this subsidization and welfare because the clinton policy destroyed the economy but we now see haiti as the major transshipment point through the caribbean in a lawless society which just within the last number of hours has conducted an election and we will see how that goes in the meantime the puppets that we have put in place have slaughtered people in unprecedented numbers and chaos reigns on the island which is now open to drug traffickers we had before our subcommittee some videotapes of drug traffickers landing at will and transshipping heroin and other illegal narcotics cocaine through haiti again where we spent hundreds of millions of dollars supposedly building judicial institutions police forces and other expenditures to socalled nation build that have been a complete failure so this is why we have unprecedented quantities of heroin coming into the united states it would be bad enough if we just had heroin and cocaine but these charts which i showed last week i would like to bring up again tonight and again i did not produce them the administrations own commission on sentencing brought these to our subcommittee and it shows crack in yellow and the darker color here is methamphetamine and it shows 1992 almost not on the charts the prevalence in 1993 begins to increase with the advent of this administration 1994 it becomes an even broader pattern across the united states 1995 spreads even further one would think this was something put out by the republican national committee here as propaganda but in fact these are the charts that were given to us by the administrations own sentencing commission look at the prevalence of crack in 1996 and methamphetamines 1997 1998 reaching epidemic proportions we not only have heroin epidemics in parts of the country an increase as a result again of this huge influx coming from colombia and also from mexico two major failures of unitedstates foreign policy some of it through haiti another failure of policy we now have an incredible meth and crack epidemic in many parts of our country the chemical that helps produce this and meth gangs in our hearings have produced some incredible results and documentation the meth dealers and the meth product is coming out of mexico to communities like iowa and we will be going out there to do a hearing shortly our subcommittee we held hearings in sacramento in that area of the state and san diego meth epidemics incredible tales of how methamphetamines destroys peoples lives causes them to abandon their children it is far worse than the crack epidemic that we had in the 1980s and meth does incredible damage to people causes them to commit bizarre acts what was interesting again these two charts show the meth epidemic and crack epidemic across this country is that we have had in our subcommittee on drug policy criminal justice drug policy scientists who show us what meth does to the brain tonight as we get towards the end i wanted to show a little bit to the members of congress and others who are watching what takes place this is a scientific brain scan presented again to our subcommittee it shows the normal brain here and we see a lot of the yellow here this would be the normal brain pattern then it shows a gradual reduction in dopamine which is so important to brain function because of meth use this is additional methamphetamine use the only thing a habitual methamphetamine user has differently from this last brain scan if we look at that is a tiny bit of brain capability left the last scan is severe parkinsonss disease so meth destroys the brain and brain function it is not something that regenerates according to the scientfsts this is a very graphic illustration of the destruction of the human mind the brain and it accounts for the incredible acts of violence the spouse abuse the child abuse the abandonment of family and life as we know it when people become addicted and their brain is destroyed by methamphetamine unfortunately as i said also heroin which has such a glamorous connotation today is more deadly than it has ever been in the 60 70 percent purity levels when mixed with other substances it is accounting for incredible record numbers of deaths across the united states when used sometimes by firsttime users it results in fatalities and drugrelated deaths at record levels the only thing that has kept our level of heroin deaths at a gradual increase in deaths and not even higher records is the ability now to provide anecdote medical treatment emergency treatment however admissions for overdoses are in fact soaring as i cited throughout every region of the united states unfortunately it is not a very pretty picture unfortunately there have been some serious mistakes made by this administration by the congress when it was controlled by the other side from 1992 to 1994 it is a difficult task to pick up humptydumpty so to speak and put it back together it is a difficult task to conduct a war on drugs after a war in fact has been dismantled i am pleased that the republicancontrolled congress has dramatically increased the funding of programs across the board in a very balanced fashion the success that we knew in the reagan and bush administration when drugs were going down according to charts not produced by me but universities and others very competent sources showed that that was a successful program so this republicancontrolled congress has increased source country programs back to the 1992 levels the 1991 levels interdiction we are trying to bring the military back in to this program the military does not arrest anyone it merely provides surveillance information and reinstitute forward operating locations which have been dismantled under this administration and allowed that incredible volume of hard deadly more pure drugs come in to our border we have begun a billion dollar unprecedented match by a billion dollars in donated time a national media campaign which is one year underway and we are working to improve that we are trying to fund treatment and prevention programs at an unparalleled level in fact have dramatically increased the federal funding for treatment programs and again put in place hopefully a balanced approach to the problem of illegal narcotics it is my hope that we can work as we conclude the 13 appropriation bills in funding a real effort against illegal narcotics a real war against illegal drugs as a multifaceted project in the congress because we have 13 appropriation bills and many of them deal with pieces of this puzzle putting it back together in fact is important we have stalled in getting the money to colombia and that is a horrible mistake and shame on both sides of the aisle shame on this administration and this president for not getting that package here in a timely fashion and acting on it we know that heroin is coming from colombia and mexico and we must stop illegal narcotics at their source"],

recommit the republican tax bill is the definition of fiscal recklessness it seeks to enact a tax cut that is based only on projected surpluses under ten and fifteen year estimates budget projections for the next ten years have improved by nearly 2 trillion in the last twelve monthsthey could go the other way just as quickly if budget projections turn out to be wrong the budget will return to deficits financed by borrowing from the social security surplus even the congressional budget officethe source of budget projections upon which the republicans tax cuts are basedsays these projections could vary as much as 100 billion a year thats an extremely wide margin of error wide enough to cause deep concerns among fiscal conservatives like me furthermore even though republicans are spending money they cant guarantee will exist their tax plan still leaves no resources to meet important needs in education agriculture or defense as well as funding for our veterans and other priorities it is based on the assumption that discretionary spending will be cut by 595 billion below 1999 levels adjusted for inflation over the next ten years this will require a cut in all discretionary programs of ten percent below current levels any increased spending in any area will require even deeper cuts in all other spending the exploding costs of the tax bill will place an even greater squeeze on discretionary spending in later years if these massive tax cuts are passed education will suffer greatly the republican tax bill includes a change to the taxexempt bond arbitrage rules that largely fails to meet the stated objective of modernizing schools especially in rural areas under h r 2488 school districts would have four years to spend school construction bond proceeds rather than the two years currently permitted according to republicans this would enable school districts to invest bond proceeds for a longer period and recognize greater arbitrage profits the republicans contend that their plan is universal covering cities suburbs and farms the truth is many suburban and city school districts will receive no benefits from the republican proposal schools with urgent needs forced to teach children in trailers and dilapidated buildings would not benefit from h r 2488 their backlog of unmet needs means that they do not have the luxury of waiting four years before completing school construction the republican proposal also largely excludes some of our most needy schoolthose in rural areas the provisions in the republican tax bill may benefit a few large wealthy school districts with the financial capacity to issue large bonds four years in advance of need but it will not help rural districts the bottom line is simple this bill will only serve to hurt the american people by jeopardizing the stability of our economy and the prosperity of future generations for the instant gratification of tax cuts that are not only irresponsible but dangerous in reality the best tax cut we can give to all americans is keeping interest rates low by paying down our debt reducing our national debt will provide a tax cut for millions of americans because it will restrain interest rates thereby saving them money on variable mortgages new mortgages auto loans credit card payments etc each percentage point increase in interest rates would mean an extra 200 250 billion in mortgage costs to americans paying down the national debt will protect future generations from an increasing tax burden to pay interest on the debt run up by current generations more than 25 of individual income taxes go to paying interest on our national debt every dollar of lower debt saves more than one dollar in taxes for future generations i urge you to act responsibly and conservativelysupport the

like to tell the members why bill mote was born in my state of florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal

promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who

the arguments before and i suspect that the debate will not change many minds about the proposal but as a new member i must say this resolution strikes me as one of the oddest pieces of legislation that ive encountered yetand i think its one of the worst im not a lawyer but its clear that the language of the proposal is an invitation to litigationin other words to getting the courts involved even further in the lawmaking process to say that congress can define when a constitutional requirement would apply provided that the congressional decision is reasonable is to ask for lawsuits challenging whatever definition might be adopted arent there enough lawsuits already over the tax laws do we need to invite more but more important than the technical aspects of this proposal i think it is bad because itmoves away from the basic principle of democracymajority rule under this proposal there would be another category of bills that would require a twothirds vote of both the house and the senate thats bad enough as it applies here in the house but consider what that means in the senate there if any 34 senators are opposed to something that take a twothirds vote it cannot be passed and of course each state has the same representation regardless of population consider what that means if the senators in opposition are those from the 17 states with the fewest residents we dont yet have this years census numbers of course but the most recent estimates that i have seen show that the total population of the 17 leastpopulous states is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million people thats a respectable number but remember that the population of the country is 270 million or more so what this resolution would do would be to give senators representing about 7 percent of the american people more power to block something even if it has sweeping support in the rest of the country right now that kind of supermajority is needed under the constitution to ratify treaties propose constitutional amendments and to do a few other things but this resolution does not deal with things of that kind it deals only with certain tax billsbills that under the constitution have to originate here in the house those are the bills that would be covered by this increase in the power of senators who could represent a small minority of the american people why would we want to do that

members of the committee for including in this appropriation an additional sum for the operations and maintenance of the programs at the eastwest center which is located in honolulu the state of hawaii in 1996 the eastwest centers budget of 24 million which had been an ongoing appropriation was drastically cut to about 11 75 million and it has had a tremendous crisis in trying to maintain its staff and to keep up with the program which it was required to perform on its establishment in 1960 so this years appropriation increase though not to the full 24 million but the level of 17 5 million is a tremendous boost it is going to give confidence to those who have remained in the center to continue on this important work the eastwest center is an internationally respected research and educational institution it has a 39year record of achievement it is important in the overall response of the united states to the importance of the asiapacific region in 1960 it was the eisenhower administration and congress together that established this center it is not an instrument or a department of the university of hawaii it is an independent incorporated entity it is attached to and reports to the state department and to the usia numerous topranking officials from all of the asiapacific countries have been through the eastwest center they are familiar with the center and it serves as an important forum for international cooperation and study i think that one of the most important contributions that the united states can make is in our ideas and if we have this center we have a place where people from all over the asiapacific area can come together study do research and communicate on the problems of mutual concern and it is one of the most important contributions i think that any center of this kind can make towards the diplomacy of our country the asia studies development program also not only with the elements of individuals from asia but also we have an interconnect with our own universities and our own college students and with the minority colleges and with others who have an opportunity because the center exists to understand the curricula that would be necessary for the support of an asiapacific concept so this nationwide program which is unique in its k ind the only one that exists in the country centered there at the eastwest center serves to expand the opportunities of americas young people in understanding this most important area of the world where we have hundreds of millions of people that live and who serve as an important base for the diplomacy of the united states so with the very small staff of only 30 people they have mounted this in credible outreach into the pacific region we always talk about the importance of this region this center is the reason for our ability to expand our knowledge and our reach into this region of the world and i am really very thankful that the committee has seen fit to grant us this modest increase this year the asiapacific region accounts for more than half the worlds population about a third of the worlds economy and vast marine and land resources the united states has vital national interests in connecting itself in partnership with the region as the asiapacific region continues to develop and change it is essential that the untied states be seen as a part of the region rather than an outsider people from asian and pacific countries are treated as partners at the center this is why the eastwest center has long had prestige in the region disproportionate to its small size with only 30 positions the centers research staff is half the size of a typical department in a larger state university the center has been able to attract considerable funding in addition to its congressional appropriation which was 12 5 million in fy 1999 in fy 1998 the center received grants contracts and gifts of 6 5 million however the vast majority of these funds 5 7 million were restricted gifts set aside for specific studies or programs requested by the granting country or organization it is essential that congressional funding support the core functions of this national institution so that its agenda is not set by external funders the funding level authorized by h r 2415 would make possible expanding the jefferson fellows media program for journalists from the region and the united states expanding the young leaders program for junior members of national or state legislative bodies initiating an intensive professional training program for young strategic specialists from the region creating a dialogue among private sector economists on regional economic and financial issues to occur in conjunction with meeting of unitedstates and regional treasury and central bank officials thus paralleling the existing europefocused ballegio process strengthening research capabilities in economics politics security environment and health expanding the reach of the

connect a younger generation of okinawans to the united states through the eastwest center in the 1960s and 1970s the center trained many of okinawas elite in fact the centers most active alumni chapter is in okinawa in recent years however few okinawan students have come to the center the initiative would add a strong and symbolic nonmilitary dimension to a unitedstates relationship with okinawa that is now dominated by the military bases in addition to its research and shortterm training programs the eastwest center provides scholarships for 165 students pursuing bachelor master and doctorate degrees of the 165 students 44 are from the united states 24 are from the pacific islands and the balance are from asia of the unitedstates students only 3 are from hawaii the balance are

eddie and a sister pam there is a saying that states big things come in small packages this holds true for walter hailing from columbia ms walter did not play organized football until the tenth grade it was in columbia where he began to amaze everyone who saw him play in 1970 walter attended jackson state university where he began his assault on ncaa history by becoming the all time leading scorer a distinction which earned him a fourth place finish in the heisman trophy race in 1974 in 1975 payton was selected by the chicago bears as the fourth selection overall from that point payton began a career that would include many awards including his externalized place of honor at the pro football hall of fame in canon oh the people who were fortunate enough to see him play were entertained at every level whether it was a run block kick pass or a reception walter gave the crowd everything at 100 percent his running style earned him the nickname sweetness to see him punish wouldbe tacklers was definitely a delight he was a total player involving himself in every aspect of the game he was unselfish in his play and always put the team first it was this unselfish attitude that fueled the chicago bears to a super bowl championship in 1985 a filing award for a well deserving athlete in 1987 payton left the game to pursue other goals he left the game but not after setting many records including the all time leading rushing record of 16 276 yards a record that still stands strong to this day after football payton became as dedicated to being an effective businessman as he was to being an effective football player he became heavily involved in auto racing both as a driver and owner this led him to many business interests and holdings including an attempt to become the first africanamerican owner of a nfl franchise in a world where diversity is expanding and new arenas are being opened for people of color it is refreshing to know that walter attempted every day to venture into different markets that were not so accessible before i had the pleasure of meeting walter in my office here in washington walter exemplified the same passion and fire for his business as he did for the game of football after his final game payton was quoted as saying he played because it was fun and that he loved to play the next time we see a football game where a player dives over the heap

house i did so because i thought it was inadequate it came back from conference andi opposed it at that point in time we did not really have a real conference but to the extent that a conference report came back i said it was inadequate and i opposed it the gentleman from arizona rises and i think correctly states the provisions of this bill i think he also correctly states that we did in fact reach bipartisan agreement on this bill and that in fact the bill as it now stands as it stood before the president as it stands now is a good bill it is a bill in my opinion that every member of this house on either side of the aisle can support it is furthermore a bill that i hope every member of the body will support at some point in time in the very near future i am not sure when we are going to get to that point but hopefully in the near future the gentleman from arizona also correctly points out and the gentleman from florida pointed out if one reads the veto message that the president of the united states says that he can sign this bill in fact i urged the president of the united states to sign this bill i wished he had signed the bill but he chose to make the point which frankly we have been making over and over again that unfortunately this process did not come to really focus until just a few weeks ago the reason it did not come to focus until a few weeks ago and i do not speak just to the treasurypostal bill it is because for 8 2 months and effectively all of september we pretended that the appropriations process was not going to be a process in which all of us would be party but it would be a process that simply frankly the majority party would be a party of unfortunately when we did as the gentleman from arizona has pointed out come to agreement and agree on a very good bill we got it down there relatively late i e 10 days ago i would urge the members however not to become too exercised about this bill the reason i do that is because i believe we do have agreement what we do not have agreement on is what the president discussed in his veto message and they are important issues they are unrelated at least substantively to the treasurypostal bill but we know and any of us who have been in the last weeks of any legislative session and i found this when i was in the state senate for 12 years and i found it here for 19 years that unfortunately issues tend to get wrapped up with one another that do not necessarily relate to one another substantively but clearly do politically so i would urge the majority party i would urge ourselves to try to come to agreement now both sides feel that agreements are not being kept that is not a good context in which to try to get back to the table the majority party believes the president said he would sign this bill i was not in the room therefore cannot assert that that was or was not the case some others who apparently were in the room and talked to the administration said that the administration said that they could sign this bill but again i was not in the room but that they were concerned they were particularly concerned about a particular tax provision and they wanted to see all the tax provisions considered at one time now i hope clearly that this bill is going to go to committee and the veto will be considered my suspicion is that we will at some point in time hopefully in the near term fold it in but i would urge all my colleagues that when the president says that it is related to other things his desire and i hope our desire is to get the issues before the house resolved get the issues before the senate resolved and send themto the president we have just had a significant discussion about the fact that we do not have agreement on the laborhealth ^bill the gentleman from wisconsin who was in the room i was not but the gentleman from wisconsin whose integrity i trust wholly says that he thought they had an agreement it is my understanding although the gentleman from florida did not say so in so many words that he thought there was an agreement but he needed to check it out with some people that agreement fell i would hope that in the next 24 hours and i see the gentleman from texas the majority whip is on the floor he and i worked together on a number of things but i would hope that we could come to grips with the items that the president of the united states has said he believes are priority items whether one agrees with the veto of the treasurypostal bill or not everybody agrees that it was not on the substance of the bill the bill is a good bill it is however an effort by the president of the united states to bring to closure the 106th congress to bring to closure the 106th congress in a way that will bring credit to agreements between the parties i referred earlier in discussions about the appropriations bills to an extraordinary speech given by newt gingrich on the floor of this house it was a speech which i have entitled the perfectionist caucus speech it was a speech in which he said the american public has elected the president of one party a majority party in the house and senate of another party and a very large and significant number of members of the presidents party it is not surprising therefore that we find ourselves in substantial disagreement from time to time on substantive important issues but as newt gingrich said in that perfectionist caucus speech it is the expectation of the american public that we will come to agreement that we will come to compromise democracy is not perfect and rarely do we win everything that we want but the american public does expect us to agree they expect to bring this congress to a close we argue on our side that they expect us to do some things that we have been talking about for an entire year and indeed longer than that in many instances to which the president referred like education funding for classrooms and more teachers that is really not a contentious issue most of us on this floor on both sides of the aisle know that we have a shortage of teachers know that we have a shortage of classrooms know that we would like to get classroom sizes down we ought to move on that most of us say that we are for prescription drugs for seniors we have differences on how that ought to occur what the president is saying is we ought to come to agreement on that

ground to work together to expand markets for our dairy products and we are not just talking about fluid milk either i think there is a tremendous market worldwide for cheese products and other dairy products which we can produce so well so efficiently with great quality here in the united states but unfortunately as i say we spend too much of our time from a national perspective not looking for additional markets for our dairy farmers both here in the united states and around the world but fighting amongst ourselves over this antiquated byzantine unfair milk marketing order system"],

this is in particular about texas and i wish to thank the chairman the gentleman from california for his ongoing funding of projects that the army corps of engineers is working on sims bayou an area that flooded enormously over the years which we are keeping on schedule we want to thank the committee for its continued commitment on that issue and likewise though we are competitive with many of our fellow colleagues i wish to thank the chairman for his work on and the funding of the houston port because that is an enormous economic arm for the community that i come from and we appreciate very much the fact that that is being kept on track lastly let me say to the chairman and i know there are many other smaller projects that we will benefit from in the state of texas and in particular the 18th congressional district but i also want to note as i have heard my colleagues speak about being environmentally safe and secure we realize how much energy and water resources deal with the environment and we appreciate the committees sensitivity i want to say to my constituents in the 18th congressional district in the houston area that i will continue to work with them and that the projects that we are funding will be environmentally sound and that i will continue to work with the committee on these issues i rise in support of h r 2605 the energy and water development appropriations for fiscal year 2000 i support this bill mainly because it provides a total of 5 0 billion in fiscal year 2000 for planning construction operation and maintenance and other activities relating to water projects administered by the army corps of engineers and the interior departments bureau of reclamation this bill increases funding for the army corps of engineers by 283 million 7 percent above the administrations request the sims bayou project is a project that stretches through my district over the course of recent years the sims bayou has seen massive amounts of flooding citi zens in my congressional district have been flooded out of their homes and businesses and as a result their lives have been continually disrupted in 1994 some 759 homes were flooded as a result of the overflow from the sims bayou mr chairman that is 759 families that were forced from their homes and livelihoods this bill continues the important work of ensuring the continued vitality of the houston community i mainly support this bill because the appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development has included 18 3 million for construction and improvement of the sims bayou these funds are needed to continue this vital project and as a result protect the community from further loss of property the project is located in south central houston and harris county the sims bayou flood control project provides flood damage reduction and consists of 19 3 miles of channel improvement and erosion control measures with environmental quality measures riparian habitat improvements and authorized recreational features i would like to express my gratitude to the army corps of engineers for their cooperation in bringing some relief to the people of the 18th congressional district their continued efforts continue to avoid and avert the dangers posed by uncontrolled flooding in the houston community in addition to the sims bayou project the subcommittee on energy and water development also provided funding for several other locations in houston these projects include the buffalo bayou project and the hunting bayou project funding was also provided for the houstongalveston navigation channels i am quite certain mr chairman that these projects would not have been able to go forward if this additional money had not been appropriated by the subcommittee on energy and water development for that i have to thank chairman packard ranking member visclosky and my friend and colleague chet edwards who sit on the appropriations committee i will continue to work with the army corps of engineers and the local houston officials to ensure that these projects are successfully completed we need to ensure that these communities are fully protected from the ravages of flooding i urge my colleagues to vote yes on h r 2605 the energy and water appropriations act for fiscal year 2000"], [0.00013825297355651855, 0.4998617470264435, 1, "today we here in the united states and throughout the world are celebrating international womens day unfortunately too many women in the world today have no cause for celebration nearly 600 000 women die each year from complications of pregnancy and child birth that is one woman every minute of these deaths 99 percent take place in the developing world where maternal deaths account for up to onethird of all deaths of women of childbearing age according to the world health organization for every maternal death that occurs worldwide an estimated 30 additional women suffer pregnancyrelated health problems that can be permanently debilitating a womans lifetime risk of dying from pregnancyrelated complications or during child birth can be as high as one in 15 in developing countries as compared to one in 7 000 in developed countries more than 150 million married women in developing nations march 8 2000 still want to space or limit child bearing but do not have access to modern contraceptives yet despite these startling estimates the unitedstates commitment to womens health remains woefully inadequate and that is why i along with 22 other colleagues have introduced legislation to increase the unitedstates commitment to womens health by 300 million as part of a legislation known as the global health act of 2000 h r 3826 the global health act of 2000 authorizes additional resources to improve childrens and womens health and nutrition provide access to voluntary family planning and combat the spread of infectious diseases particularly hiv aids only the global health act represents a comprehensive balanced approach that builds upon proven existing programs to increase the unitedstates commitment to go balance health as effectively as possible over 100 groups such as the global health council save the children the salvation army world services and the global aids action network support the global health act 2000 in august of 1999 my constituents were shocked to learn that an outbreak of west nilelike encephalitis had surfaced for the first time in the western hemisphere in the heart of my congressional district in queens and the bronx this outbreak was a wakeup call for every american not just new yorkers it illustrated that the global community has truly become a local community as demonstrated by hiv aids west nilelike encephalitis and tuberculosis a disease respects no borders an outbreak in africa europe asia or south america can travel to unitedstates shores within days no longer can diseases occurring in faroff lands be ignored they pose a direct threat to the national security of our great country and must be addressed by the unitedstates government this congress and the international community as a whole diseases cannot be seized by customs and they do not apply at the unitedstates embassy for a visa the only way to stop them is to target them at their source the global health act recognizes this and emphasizes the interconnectiveness of global health by calling for increased funding for child survival womens health and nutrition reducing unintended pregnancies and combatting the spread of other infectious diseases it also calls for increased coordination between the different government agencies administering health programs with the resources provided under the global health act and the assistance of other nations we can make a profound difference in the health and wellbeing of millions of the worlds poorest citizens especially women and protect our own national security at the same time we are the greatest power the world has ever known we cannot continue to keep our head in the sand on this international issue we have to recognize that we do not live in a cocoon we can tackle this problem as a nation and as a world

to me today about the bill that i am sponsoring the global health act 2000 to lend her voice in support i know that she met with a number of members of the house today i believe also members of the senate to bring attention much needed attention to this issue she spoke personally to me about her homeland and about her home continent she is headquartered today in new york she sees it and i view it myself as the headquarters of the world we will not say the capital of the world but certainly it is the headquarters of the world it is convenient in that it is the home to the u n but also new york at times can command international attention we are happy that she is in new york working on this very very important issue and at the same time sparing some time from her busy schedule to come down here to washington to lobby members of the house and the senate on this important issue to get their support we need more support for this legislation i hope we can all keep this in mind as we

not create or permit indian gaming when it passed igra the indian gaming regulatory act of 1988 rather it sought to regulate an industry that had been growing throughout the previous decade that was legally outside the scope of state regulatory powers so now tribes can only game to the extent the state authorizes gaming within that state for class iii gaming or casino gaming a compact is required with the state i have numerous casinos in my district indian gaming facilities i have heard tonight about all these promises we are going to help out with the native americans well native americans have been hearing these promises for over 200 years from this congress bia and interior and it does not materialize i still remember in my lifetime where the city fathers of the local communities would only count the native americans for their population base and their poverty level so they could get government grants to put in roads to put in water and sewer and the water and sewer and roads never made it to the native american reservation now what has happened at least in my district native americans have the right to game and gaming has been the only successful economic development tool many of these tribes have known tribes all over the country are rebuilding their infrastructure long neglected by the federal government and providing an increased level of social services to their own members are there problems yes there are problems but can they be worked out you bet they can take michigan after igra was passed in 1988 we have had two different governors philosophically worlds apart politically john engler and jim blanchard but yet they were both able to work out their differences with the native americans and enter into compacts we hear all these arguments about well jeez if they come in and try to open up a casino they will destroy the infrastructure of these small communities i have got small communities like christmas michigan and hessell you cannot get much smaller than that but underneath our compact they get 2 percent of the profits the state of michigan takes another 8 percent for any problems they may cause the state of michigan the governor can limit the number of casinos the governor can limit the number of slot machines the governor can limit the type of games that are being played the governor can limit whether or not there is ever casino gaming on a piece of land whether it is by a school by a church 150 miles from their reservation the governors can do it if they are willing to step up to their responsibility and since 1988 the governors can deny opening casinos on any piece of property the two compacts we have had ii michigan have worked well i would oppose this amendment and i would ask that we oppose prohibiting the secretary as the arbitrator final arbitrator before we always have to go to court we should not always have to go to court to try to address differences because of sovereignty i believe this amendment is

review where we started all this because sometimes i think we get a little beyond where we really have commenced and where we are going basically the request in terms of dollars to go to teachers is the same in terms of what is in the bill what the minority is requesting as what we have provided at 1 7 billion as a matter of fact we have agreed on this side that 75 percent of that money should go to the class size issue which they are mentioning so basically we are arguing over the other 25 percent and the question is should that 100 percent go to class size or should it go to teacher training to help with quality obviously i come down on the side of more flexibility a little bit later when i have a little more time i am going to talk about that i would like to talk about mrs buckles for a moment i had her in seventh grade she taught us diagraming in seventh grade i am surprised i survived all that i can tell the members the woman could teach brilliantly as a matter of fact i learned something about the construction of a sentence which i remember to this day because of her ability to teach i do not think it would have made any difference if there were five people in that classroom or 100 people in that classroom she had the ability to get our attention the ability to enforce discipline the ability to process the work that was there everybody in that classroom learned dramatically as a result of being in there with mrs buckles a good teacher can do that 1 have also visited elementary schools in wilmington delaware and other parts of delaware where i have seen teachers i thought needed extra assistance in terms of what they are doing and perhaps needed another teacher to help reduce class size or a teacher aide i think we need to provide those teachers the inspiration the educational experience the training perhaps the quality experience whatever it may be in order to improve their teaching frankly where we lose a lot of teachers is in their first or second year of teaching in fact maybe the young lady who has gone to work for the gentlewoman from ohio is in that capacity we lose them because they do not necessarily have the proper training that is where the greatest percentage of teachers is lost we need to retain them as well that is why i beseech everybody here to get behind the concept of having some flexibility on these particular dollars which we are talking about i hope we can come to an agreement at some point on it mr wu i yield myself 1 minute i would like to just point out to the gentleman from delaware that in fiscal year 1999 funding school districts local educational authorities used only 8 percent of the allocations under this fund for personal development and teacher training we upped that amount from 15 percent to 25 percent but the evidence from the flexibility that we have granted local education authorities is that we have lots of flexibility under this program because they are not using anything close to the 15 or the 25 percent of the monies that they can for teacher training under this program i must further add that the reason why we are here today this is not an exercise in futility this is not a dry fire exercise the reason why we are here today is because the passage of each and every day means the loss of an opportunity to make a difference in a childs life i yield 2 minutes to the

mean we can say that is not a politically correct statement but that is what abortion is is an unborn human being a child is being killed now we can say no that is not it it has no standing but the fact is the supreme court recognizes that death in this country only occurs when there is an absence of brain waves and heartbeat at 19 days postconception infants children in their mothers womb mieet that the other contention that i think we ought to talk about very frankly is whether or not killing an unborn child is health care who is that health care for and should we ask the taxpayers of this country to subsidize the taking of unborn life the fact is the vast majority of americans today do not believe that abortion is the right thing to do by far it is growing every day as they see the truth about abortion the fact is that we do not consider the rights of the unborn child except if the child is injured unintentionally in a car wreck or injured in some other way then it has standing but if it has standing at those times we are going to say the rest of the time it has no standing mark my words our country will change this we can all disagree about whether or not this is a right or a wrong thing to do but the fact that we should not subsidize it and the fact that the american people by a large majority do not want us subsidizing it speaks very plainly to the fact that they know what the truth is abortion is not health care abortion is taking the life of an unborn human being that is unique has never been here before never been created before is totally unique has the attributes of life a beating heart active brain waves we can deny that because it is conyenient to rationalize our moral choice for an inadvertent sexual activity this amendment would pretend that
