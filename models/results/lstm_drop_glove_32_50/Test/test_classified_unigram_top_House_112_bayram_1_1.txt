action to use prosecutorial discretion to stop deportations for dream acteligible immigrants we are pledging our continued and strong support for this policy my colleagues and i 104 of us are standing together to make clear that we think america is a better place with the immigrants who will be helped by this new policy of course not everyone agrees progress doesnt always mean consensus my colleague mr king of iowa wants to sue the president take him to court because mr king is determined to deport every last young person who is dream act eligible mitt romney says that he would veto the dream act and does not support steps to protect these very young people lets remind ourselves exactly who the republican candidate for president believes should be deported dream acteligible young people who have lived in america for more than 5 years most of them were brought to our nation as children many of them as infants toddlers yes babies theyve stayed away from crime they attended our high schools and colleges they are no different from your children or my children they regularly excel at school some are valedictorians they are athletes and musicians and leaders many of them want to serve our nation in the military they are leaders in their high school rotc they are in every sense of the word except for the very narrow exclusive sense promoted by mr king and mr romney outstanding young americans apparently when mr king and mr romney look at the winner of your high school science fair or a young immigrant eager to become a soldier they see a threat to our national security sensible americans see their friends and neighbors young people who want to make america better they want these young people to be treated fairly and they also want our nation to be safe so i would ask mr king and mr romney a question in a world where our law enforcement officials have limited time and resources who should they be focused on investigating detaining putting behind bars rounding up and deportingthe captain of your high school chess team or a drug smuggler i know the answer i think most of americans would agree immigrants who break the law should face serious consequences immigrants who are busy studying for exams should simply be left alone thats not just my opinion or just the opinion of immigrants or advocates or 104 of my colleagues despite those few who would like to sue the president and force him to kick high school kids out of this country president obamas actually legally and responsibly using prosecutorial discretion to leave young people alone and focus instead on actual criminals it is the consensus legal opinion among experts even the supreme court has weighed in in their arizona decision last month the supreme court wrote a principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials federal officials as an initial matter must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all says the supreme court if the supreme courts opinion is not enough then i submit the opinions of members of congress including those of members i dont often agree with when it comes to immigration these members include lamar smith the chairman of our judiciary committee david dreier chairman of the rules committee and even brian bilbray chairman of the house antiimmigration caucus just a few years ago as this letter notes they weighed in forcefully on prosecutorial discretion in a letter to a previous presidents administration these staunch opponents of immigration reform enthusiastically defended prosecutorial discretion writing the principle of prosecutorial discretion is well established they wrote that legal experts at immigration services apparently wellgrounded in case law show that the immigration services has prosecutorial discretion in the intiationthe beginningand the termination of deportations its simple really the members of congress who signed this letter with me today the supreme court president obamaand yes even lamar smith and dozens of his colleagues just a few years agoget it it is time to leave hardworking immigrants alone when we do our law enforcement officials can focus on catching the actual bad guys president barack obama the white house pennsylvania avenue washington dc dear mr president we write to thank you and express our appreciation for your recent decision to grant deferred action protection from deportation and work permits to certain young people who call the united states home and who are not an enforcement priority for the department of homeland security dhs we welcome the opportunity to ensure that our constituents who fit the criteria for relief are among the estimated 800 000 individuals whose lives will forever be changed as a result of your leadership dreamers coming forward to apply will mark a new chapter but not the last chapter in a long struggle for inclusion in society the new policy represents an important down payment toward achieving broader reforms in the future the implications of your policy are already reverberating well beyond those who are potentially eligible for deferred action with this announcement you have changed the public discourse about immigration and immigrants and our communities are now excited and hopeful even those who attack immigrants for political purposes are second guessing their negative posture toward the young immigrants you are protecting you have opened the door to reform and people of all political stripes recognize that change is coming and is inevitable we recognize that there are those who will want to take the power of discretion away from you and the executive branch like you we agree that you are on solid moral and legal ground and we will do everything within our power to defend your actions and the authority that you like past presidents can exercise to set enforcement priorities and better protect our neighborhoods and our nation despite this vital reprieve for a deserving group of promising individuals we also understand that it does not diminish the need for a permanent solution and comprehensive immigration reform mr president we stand committed to fixing the broken immigration system once and for all and we are ready to fight for a permanent solution that benefits all children and families the economy our national security and our nation we thank you again for your actions on behalf of dreamers we stand ready to work with you to ensure the policys

the homeland you have to make choices about how you invest so i have a different opinion i think if you invest money you get innovation and you get jobs and none of what has been said by speaker boehner says anything about innovation jobs and he has no seemingly understanding of the importance of securing the homeland i am joined this evening by members of the congressional black caucus to call upon congress to pass a bill that increases the debt ceiling so that we can avoid economic disaster and continue to work for the american people in repairing our economy and creating jobs while i support bipartisan efforts to increase the debt limit and to resolve our differences over budgetary revenue and spending issues i cannot support any measure that unduly constrains the ability of congress to deal effectively with americas economic fiscal and job creation troubles since the debt limit was first put in place congress has increased it over 100 times in fact it was raised 10 times within the past decade congress last came together and raised the debt ceiling in february 2010 today the debt ceiling currently stands at 14 3 trillion in reality that limit has already been eclipsed but due to accounting procedures by treasury secretary geithner the debt limit can be avoided until august 2nd congress must act now in order to avert a crisis never in the history of america has the united states defaulted on its debt obligations we must be clear on what this issue means for our country united states treasury bonds have traditionally been one of the safest investments another country or investor could make for foreign nations and investors purchasing a unitedstates treasury bond meant that they held something virtually as safe as cash backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government as we continue to discuss the necessity of increasing out debt ceiling i have heard the concerns of many of my constituents and the american people regarding the size of our national debt and the care with which taxpayer money is spent i too am concerned about these issues for to burden future generations of americans with tremendous amounts of debt should not be a way to avoid our fiscal responsibilities to the american people however the task of resolving our debt ceiling crisis must take precedence over other concerns including political ideology prior to the existence of the debt ceiling congress had to approve borrowing each time the federal government wished to borrow money in order to carry out its functions with the onset of world war i more flexibility was needed to expand the governments capability to borrow money expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of funding a major war in the modern era to address this need the first debt ceiling was established in 1917 allowing the federal government to borrow money to meet its obligations without prior congressional approval so long as in the aggregate the amount borrowed did not eclipse a specified limit in turn with the proceeds from the bonds the federal government of the worlds largest economy is able to finance its operations if the united states defaults on its debt obligations the financial crisis that began in 2008 would pale in comparison according to economic experts the ensuing economic catastrophe would not only place the unitedstates economy in a tailspin but the world economy as well the fact that congress a body that typically has its fair share of political battles has never played political chicken when it came to raising the debt ceiling should give us all pause and is a testament to the seriousness with which we must approach this issue however this time around some of my republican colleagues have created an impasse based upon an ideological commitment to spending cuts while i understand and share the concern of my republican colleagues with respect to deficit spending and will continue to work with them in order to find reductions now is not the time to put ideology over pragmatism the reality is that on august 3rd the united states will begin to default on its debt obligations if the debt ceiling is not raised this detour into a spending debate is as unnecessary as it is perilous as increasing the debt ceiling does not obligate the undertaking of any new spending by the federal government rather raising the debt limit simply allows the government to pay existing legal obligations promised to debt holders that were already agreed to by presidents and congresses both past and present raising the debt limit simply matches the amount the united states is allowed to borrow to the amount it already owes moreover the impending crisis would have already occurred were it not for the extraordinary measures taken by treasury secretary timothy geithner including the suspension of the investment in securities to finance the civil service retirement and disability fund as well as the redemption of a portion of those securities already held by that fund if the united states defaults on its obligations on august 3rd the stock market will react violently to the news that for the first time in history america is unable to keep its promises to pay not once in american history has the countrys full faith and credit been called into question credit rating agencies like moodys and standard poors stand ready to downgrade the triple a rating that america currently enjoys once america defaults investors who purchase unitedstates bonds and finance our government will be less likely to lend to america in the future just as a person who defaults on a loan will find it harder to convince banks to lend them money in the future a country that defaults on its debt obligations will find it harder to convince investors to lend money to a government that did not pay them back showing the world that the united states does not pay its debts makes the purchasing of that debt less desirable because it requires the assumption of more risk on the part of the investors furthermore any investors who continue to purchase unitedstates treasury bonds will demand much higher interest rates in order to cover the increased risk once a default occurs investors figure that the chance of the united states defaulting again is much greater and will require the government to pay higher rates of interest in order to make the loan worth the risk for investors to take on imagine the impact on our stock market if we do not pay our debts as we have seen throughout the recent financial crisis a bad stock market hurts not only big businesses and large investors on wall street but small businesses and small investors as well families with investments tied to the stock market such as 401 k s pension plans and savings will once again see the value of their investments drop the american people are tired of the uncertainty of the value of their retirement accounts with uncertainty still lingering in the markets and in the minds of citizens we must not allow another wild fluctuation in the markets to occur due to default one of the major reasons that the job market continues to remain so stagnant is the fact that the flow of credit to small businesses that enables them to hire and expand has slowed increasing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do congress has already debated and approved the debt that an increased ceiling makes room for however my republican colleagues have chosen to use this as an opportunity to hold the american people hostage to their extreme agenda they knew that the cut cap and balance act was not a realistic proposal and that it was not going to pass the senate they just wanted to waste time along with the congressional black caucus i believe that congress should increase the debt ceiling to meet the obligations the united states has already promised to undertake by refusing to do so it endangers our economy and the recovery of our jobs last week republicans introduced the cut cap and balance act which i aptly named the tap dance loser club and bust bill because it tap danced around raising our debt ceiling and acting in a responsible manner to pay our nations debt obligations that bill would have forced our nation to join a losers club as it would have eliminated important social programs such as medicaid medicare social security and pell grants the theme for the republicans seems to be a focus on cutting programs for the most at need and ignoring the need to focus on job creation this bill busts the hopes and dreams of our children seniors and military families it busts the hopes to grow our nation in the future the tap dance loser club and bust bill was just a distraction and now we have the opportunity to once again get serious about raising our debt we can not continue to waste a tremendous amount of time the deadline is right around the corner the american people cannot have a government that is the embodiment of living check to check we must do something now for a moment think about the american people step back and envision the faces of those who will be impacted if we are not successful in finding common ground they are the faces of the the elderly who will not receive their social security payments they are the faces of children and infants who will not receive their wic benefits they are the faces of hardworking every day americans including the multitudes of poor working families who will not be able to receive the benefits they need from government run programs that are keeping them from falling into homelessness when you think of our future also see our present without raising this debt limit we are putting the present and the future of americans at risk"], [0.16793006658554077,

opposition to the falsely named prenatal nondiscrimination act or prenda this might be one of the most disingenuous bills to ever come to the floor of the house the authors of this bill are talking out of both sides of their mouth today i want to set the record straight in one breath the proponents of this bill say they are protecting female fetuses by preventing abortions based on sex and that we must pass this bill to protect women everywhere and show that girls are as valid as boys yet just last week these same members obstructed the passage of an expanded violence against women act that would have protected all victims of violence the same members who today espouse equality for women voted against the lilly ledbetter fair pay act which will help combat the discrimination against women that keeps them earning 77 cents for every dollar that men earn the same members who today talk about protecting female babies continue to vote to gut the prevention and public health fund which will be used to provide lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings to millions of the very women prendas proponents claim to care so much about heres the truth this is not about womens equality prenda is simply another attempt by choice opponents to obstruct womens access to reproductive health care i agree with the bills proponents that abortions based on sex are a problem around the world and i agree that we must take action to stop these abusive practices both at home and around the world but let me be clear that this bill will not prevent sexselective abortions heres why first criminalizing such practices simply will not work banning sexselective abortions has already been tried in various countries around the world and what expert agencies such as the world health organizationwhich operate in these countrieshave found is that these bans dont prevent abortions rather they simply result in a greater demand for clandestine procedures which fall outside regulations protocols and monitoring and basic safety these restrictions serve only to drive these procedures underground making them less safe our own history proves this point second criminalization of sexselective abortions would force physicians to question women about their reasons for seeking abortion it would likely compel physicians to target certain groups of women from cultures where sexselection abortion is more prevalent to avoid liability physicians may even cease providing such care to entire groups of women simply because of their race this bill would promote racial profiling and discrimination additionally targeting such motivations in practice would be nearly impossible according to an analysis by the world health organization and four other u n agencies prosecuting offenders is practically impossible and further proving that a particular abortion was sex selective is equally difficult these expert international organizations do offer a viable solution to address this issue a solution unmentioned in h r 3541 address the root causes which drive individuals to prefer sons over daughters the united nations through its work in nations where sex selection is prevalent has stated that the most effective way to address this son preference is by fighting the root economic social and cultural causes of sex inequality south korea successfully lowered its maletofemale ratio from 116 boys for every 100 girls in the nineties to 107 boys per 100 girls in 2007 they did this by passing laws to improve the legal status of women and by implementing a public education campaign emphasizing the importance of women if were going to consider this bill lets be honest about it its supporters are not promoting womens equality and they are not serious about preventing sexselective abortions if they were they would be promoting programs to empower women and girls to combat son preference instead they are criminalizing physicians profiling cultural groups and driving abortion services underground the truth is that this bill is another attempt to restrict womens reproductive health care wrapped in the rhetoric of womens rights dont be fooled by prenda

the surface and speaker boehner made that clear when asked about the potential job losses that will result from horrendous budget cuts that we have been debating for the last couple of days when he responded so be it so i rise today to urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment this is a dangerously ideologically motivated stunt that will imperil the lives and wellbeing of millions of women and their families this amendment is not just a war on planned parenthood as the gentleman from indiana said its a war on women planned parenthood clinics are a crucial part of our national health care fabric through federal funds including medicaid reimbursements and title x funding on an annual basis planned parenthood health centers are able to offer nearly one million lifesaving screenings for cervical cancer 830 000 breast examination contraception to nearly 2 5 million patients nearly 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections including hiv and education programs for 1 2 million individuals these are much needed services that we could not afford to lose in addition to completely defunding planned parenthood this amendment would also strike all federal funding for title x programs this would be a colossal mistake and truly a matter of life and death to millions of women nationwide since 1970 the title x family planning program has been a key component of our nations health care infrastructure and an essential element in the winning strategy to reduce unintended pregnancies today title x serves over 5 million lowincome individuals every year in every state women and men rely on title x for basic primary and preventative health care including annual exams lifesaving cancer screenings contraception and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases in fact in 2009 alone title x providers performed 2 2 million pap tests 2 3 million breast exams and over 6 million tests for sexually transmitted diseases including nearly a million hiv tests as a breast cancer survivor whose cancer was caught at the earliest stage like my friend from connecticut i know how critical these screenings are in saving womens lives and preventative care isnt limited to cancer screenings and education on how to avoid stds supporters of this bill mistakenly argue that this cut is necessary to prevent federal funding for abortions let me be clear federal funding for abortions is already prohibited by law this has been the case for decades yet this amendment attempts to take funding prohibitions to an unconscionable new level and if passed will result in millions of women not being able to obtain necessary preventive care like birth control and cancer screenings if republicans truly want to reduce abortions in this country they would vote against this amendment indeed title x actually reduces the number of abortions title x services help to prevent nearly 1 million unintended pregnancies each year almost half of which would otherwise end in abortion current statistics from the gutmacher institute indicate that nearly half of pregnancies in the united states are unintended we should be providing women and their families with the resources they need not striking them indeed planned parenthood and the title x program provide vital family planning services which help improve the life of the mother and the child its a simple fact family planning keeps women and children healthy when women plan their pregnancies they are more likely to seek prenatal care improving their own health and the health of their children in fact access to family planning is directly linked to the declines in maternal and infant mortality rates there should be no shadow of a doubt that this amendment is antiwoman and antifamily while my colleague from indiana may frame this amendment in the context of fiscal responsibility that is once again a mistaken premise this amendment would not cut the deficit in fact title x actually saves taxpayer dollars since many of the patients hi160 served by title x are on medicaid preventative care like cancer screenings and contraceptive counseling actually means fewer costs to the taxpayer in the long run indeed for every public dollar invested in family planning 3 74 is saved in medicaidrelated costs thats savings to both federal and state governments and one of the most detrimental and dangerous things we could do to women and their families right now is to defund the leading title x provider nationwide planned parenthood every year planned parenthood works tirelessly to improve the health of communities across this country six in 10 women who access care from centers like planned parenthood say it is their main source of health care we cannot cut these women off from the health

citizens around the country and that is the health of nearly 10 000 residents of vieques puerto rico the people of vieques sacrificed as much as if not more than any other unitedstates civilian population to advance our military readiness in the 1940s the federal government expropriated lands on vieques for use by the navy for over 60 years the navy conducted training operations on eastern vieques including shiptoshore bombing aerial bombing and groundbased exercises the navy has reported that it dropped between 3 and 4 million pounds of ordnance on vieques each year between 1983 and 1998 training operations on vieques ceased in 2003 in part due to concerns about the risks to safety health and the environment posed by decades of weapons use the navy is now administering the cleanup of vieques with support from other federal and local agencies in 2005 the epa listed vieques as one of the most hazardous sites in the unitedstates to date over 35 000 munitions on vieques have been recovered and destroyed including at least 19 000 live munitions unfortunately numerous studies have shown that residents of vieques have higher rates of cancer and other chronic illnesses than residents of mainland puerto rico raising serious questions about whether there may be a link between those health problems and the islands long use as a military training range in december the agency for toxic substances and disease registry an agency within hhs released a draft report that addresses whether there is evidence of a causal relationship between the identified health problems

the conclusion reached by atsdr in its draft report is generally the same as the conclusion reached by the agency in a series of controversial public health assessments it conducted on vieques about a decade ago specifically that the available data does not establish that the contaminants in these pathways some of which can be linked to military activities were at levels expected to cause the reported health problems because the draft report leaves many crucial questions unanswered today im filing extensive comments that i urge atsdr to address before its report is finalized my comments are intended to be constructive because my constituents deserve a meticulous evaluation of the draft report aimed at producing concrete action by the federal government in my comments i note that atsdr repeatedly acknowledges that its conclusions are not definitive or even close to it because the available data upon which the agency relies is incomplete in many respects while atsdr recommends that further studies be conducted to fill certain data gaps the agency does not go far enough in 2009 atsdr stated that it expected to recommend biomonitoring to determine whether and to what extent residents have been exposed to harmful chemicals yet in a startling reversal the agency has now stated that it is not recommending a comprehensive systematic biomonitoring effort at this time given the health problems on vieques and the potential link between those problems and military activities such an action is misplaced therefore i have urged atsdr to recommend a comprehensive biomonitoring investigation more generally i have encouraged atsdr and other federal agencies working in partnership with independent researchers to take a more active and assertive role in designing implementing and especially funding the additional studies that are still needed to determine the nature and potential causes of the health problems being experienced by residents of vieques it is unacceptable

for the industry to comply with clean air rules impacting our children just like this little one being seen by a nurse suffering from any number of respiratory illnesses so the bill in its current form also gives the epa discretion to go beyond 5 years you know how long that is that may be jobkilling time because when businesses look to move to areas even if theyre older industry they want to know that there is an effort made to create a better quality of life this amendment will help the industry it indicates that the time for compliance is 3 years and yes there may be discretion to expand but 3 years i believe this is a fair approach because in actuality the rule that the epa has passed has resulted in 1 7 million tons of reduction in air pollution per year thats a good thing for job creation and so this amendment is a simple approach to indicating that outdoor air pollution is damaging small particles and ground level ozone come from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions why wouldnt we want to improve the quality of life i can only say to you that out of those polluting elements come chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever sneezing shortness of breath and a number of other ailments so my amendment is a good thing to be able to talk about jobs clarity knowing when you must comply and preventing premature deaths and protecting our children but let me say what else this bill does this bill causes an extra 1 million in new discretionary spending by the epa to comply were supposed to be in a budgettight atmosphere were supposed to be budget cutting but my friends that is not what were doing here so i would simply say that even though my good friend indicates that 200 000 jobs would be saved with this particular bill i dont know where the documentation is but i will assure you that areas where the boiler industry is that have a defined clarity on what the timeframe is for making sure that youre in compliance i can assure you that that creates jobs and that creates a clean atmosphere quality of life and clean air for more industry to come into your states for you to diversify so i ask my colleagues to support a simple amendment that ensures that the compliance is for 3 years clarifying that to the industry giving them a time certain to comply and also giving discretion to the epa to help america grow jobs i hope we all will join in growing jobs in voting for the american jobs act and right now i hope that well vote for the jackson lee amendment that gives clarity in timeframe for compliance and again saves lives like this little ones that we all want to protect with that i yield back the balance of my time and i ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment mr chair i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2250 the epa regulatory relief act my amendment requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with environmental protection agency epa rules no later than 3 years after the rules have been finalized currently the bill requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with epa rules no earlier than five years after the rules have been finalized the bill also allows indefinite noncompliance there is no deadline set for industry compliance the bill in its current form also gives the epa the discretion to extend the 5 year deadline for compliance the epa would have the authority to extend a three year deadline as well the three year deadline i proposed can be extended by the epa while setting a goal that shows our firm commitment to saving lives i have offered this amendment to ensure that the epa has the ability to reduce toxic emissions from numerous industrial sources including the industrial boiler industry as they are required to do under the clean air act the epa has issued clean air rules targeting 170 different types of facilities which have resulted in a 1 7 million ton reduction in air pollution per year epa rules are now being finalized for both the industrial boiler industry and cement kiln industry and these bills are intended to indefinitely delay compliance with epas maximum achievable control technology mact standards prior to their promulgation as the representative for houston the countrys energy capital i am committed to creating an environment in which the energy industry and regulating agencies can work together for more than 40 years the epa has been charged with protecting our environment there has been a consistent theme of chipping away at the ability of the epa to protect our air we have to consider the long term costs to public health if we fail to establish reasonable measures for clean air outdoor air pollution is caused by small particles and ground level ozone that comes from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions outdoor air quality is also affected by pollen from plants crops and weeds particle pollution can be high any time of year and are higher near busy roads and where people burn wood when we inhale outdoor pollutants and pollen this can aggravate our lungs and can lead us to developing the following conditions chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever lethargy sneezing shortness of breath throat irritation and watery eyes outdoor air pollution and pollen may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma there are serious costs to our long term health the epa has promulgated rules and the public should be allowed to weigh in to determine if these rules are effective the purpose of having so many checks and balances within the epa is to ensure that the needs of industries and the needs of our communities are addressed providing a time for individuals to support or oppose any regulations is a meaningful first step this bill is a step in the wrong direction the epa has spent years reviewing these standards before attempting to issue regulations the proposed regulations to the industrial boiler industry will significantly reduce mercury and toxic air pollution from power plants and electric utilities the epa estimates that for every year this rule is not implemented mercury and toxic air pollution will have a serious impact on public health think for a moment about the lives that can be saved we are talking about thousands of health complications and deaths what more do we need to know according to the natural resources defense council this rule would prevent the following 9 000 premature deaths 5 500 heart attacks 58 000 asthma attacks 6 000 hospital and emergency room visits 6 000 cases of bronchitis 440 000 missed work days this legislation not only presents a threat to public health it also blatantly violates the cutgo spending provision the epa regulatory relief act requires the epa to select a regulatory option that is least burdensome to the industrial boiler industry regardless of alternate options that may be more feasible or cost effective the congressional budget office cbo estimates that this bill will result in 1 million dollars in new discretionary spending by the epa and the bill does not offset the authorization i understand the economic impacts of regulation but we must also act responsibly we cannot ignore the public health risks of breathing polluted air nor can we pretend that these emissions do not exacerbate global warming alternatively we certainly do not want to hinder job creation and economic growth congress passed the clean air act to allow the epa to ensure that all americans had access to clean air and we must not strip the agency of that right my friends on the other side of the aisle will tell you that this act is going to save more than 200 000 american jobs but what about the lives we will lose we do not want to hinder economic prosperity and robust job creation but let us strive toward an economic climate where jobs can be created by implementing technology to reduce dangerous toxic emissions and protect the american people it does not have to be one way or the other in a country of vast innovation surely we can forge a path forward in which we do not have to choose between creating jobs and saving lives lest we forget since 1999 houston has exchanged titles with los angeles for the poorest air quality in the nation the poor air quality is attributed to the amount of aerosols particles of carbon and sulfates in the air the carcinogens found in the air have been known to cause cancer particularly in children the epa is the very agency charged with issuing regulations that would address this serious problem this bill may very well jeopardize the air that we breathe the water that we drink our public lands and our public health by deep funding cuts in priority initiatives mr chair there are times in which we are 50 individual states and there are times when we exist as a single nation with national need one state did not defend the nation after the attacks on pearl harbor one state on its own did not end segregation and establish civil rights every so often there comes an issue so vital we must unite beyond our districts and beyond our states and act as a nation and protecting the quality of our air is one of those times i encourage my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment in order to uphold the epas authority to enforce the clean air act by ensuring the industrial boiler industry must comply with finalized epa regulations we are protecting the quality of the air that all of our constituents breathe surely preventing illness and premature death by ensuring every american has access to clean air

for yielding and i thank him for his kind words im happy to share the time with him tonight and plan to remain here on the house floor for the rest of this hour ill make some comments now and yield back to the gentleman from louisiana dr fleming and maybe hell yield some additional time to me later in the hour but you know i couldnt help but notice in the previous hour which was allotted to our democratic colleagues their leadership hour they went first tonight and they chose to talk about the snap program within the department of agriculture and of course snap is an acronym for the supplemental nutrition assistance program which was formerly known i think more people would commonly know it as the food stamp program and they spent the whole hour talking about the unintended consequences of cutting discretionary federal spending and reducing government bureaucracy and bloatedness and saying that when you do that of course you hurt the poor and the nearly poor that they desperately need these programs they made some legitimate points of course were talking about health care in our hour and specifically about the passage of obamacare almost 2 years ago indeed a little more than 2 years ago now to create a whole new entitlement program for people the uninsured not the folks that were covered under safety net programs like the program for children the schip program its called the health care program for the poor medicaid certainly not the program for our seniors and our disabled americans under medicare but for folks that were somewhere in the middle that maybe couldnt afford or werent offered health insurance by their employer but they never talked about the unintended consequences of what would happen im sure our colleagues didnt intentionally pass a 2 600page bill that would deliberately hurt anybody i dont think anybody on either side of the aisle in any congress would do that any administration would do that but we physician members the gentleman from louisiana myself and others that have worked in the health care industry all of ourmost of ourprofessional lives before we got to congress understood far better and knew exactly what the unintended consequences would be of this legislation thats exactly what the gentleman from louisianas been talking about and pointing out in the poster presentation the slide presentation that he has made i could probably take the rest of the hour talking about the unintended consequences and list them my good colleague and our friend on the senate side the chairman of the senate policy committee also a physician orthopedic surgeon from wyoming dr barrasso just recently came out with a white paper on health care policies dated march 13 so just about a month ago and dr barrasso in that paper lists 10 different unintended consequences the gentleman from louisianas already mentioned a couple gone over a couple but id like to just take a few minutes before yielding back to him a go over a few of the promises that he has not yet mentioned one and this is a quote from president obama i will protect medicare in a 2009 address to congress president obama promised that he would protect medicare well the presidents health care law howeverdr fleming may have mentioned thistakes more than 500 billion from the medicare program and uses that money now he said and the democrat majority at the time said well you know were strengthening medicare but over 500 billion more than a 10 percent cut per year in medicare over a 10year period of time it took to create this new entitlement program the medicare actuary has actually written that the medicare cuts cannot be simultaneously used to finance other federal outlays such as the coverage expansion under this ppaca and to extend the medicare trust fund you cant pay for two things with the same amount of money indeed i wish we could then maybe folks wouldnt have to be on food stamps as an example the congressional budget office on that same point wrote medicare provisions in the presidents health care plan quote and again this is the cbo would not enhance the ability of the government to pay for future medicare benefits president obama actually admitted in an interview you cant say that you are saving on medicare and then spending the money twice thats what the president said but thats exactly what the law does it spends the same money twice undermining unfortunately a great medicare program that needs to be strengthened and protected that was one of the promises broken promises made but not kept as dr barrasso senator barrasso pointed out let me add one more this is no 5 of the 10 that dr barrasso mentioned in his white paper of last month from the policy committee on the senate side candidate obama said there was no need for a mandate this is back in 2008 in that campaign against senator hillary clinton candidate obama opposed a mandate to buy insurance and made it one of the hallmarks of his primary campaign he claimed that penalizing people for not buying health insurancelisten to this mr speakerwas like and i quote solving homelessness by mandating everyone buy a house he said president obama senator obama at the time candidate obama solving homelessness by mandating everyone buy a house well this is like solving the uninsured problem by mandating that all the rest of us pay for health insurance for a lot of people that could afford to buy health insurance but just simply did not want it i dont know how many millions of people make more than 50 000 a year or 75 000 a year that really didnt want dont want would rather pay as they go i dont recommend it dr fleming doesnt recommend it we think they ought to have some minimal coverage and certainly catastrophic coverage but this is their right their liberty to choose if they want to not have that coverage and president obamas health care law as we all know now created an unprecedented federal requirement for all citizens to purchase a product merely because they exist because theyre living and breathing and not just a product under this bill when its fully implemented in 2014 the minimal coverage requirement as the gentleman from louisiana pointed out wouldnt allow them to lets say have a minimed policy as many of the franchisees do across this country in the fastfood industry they all had to be granted waivers so here again another promise made and not kept i have a couple more that ill get to maybe later on in the hour but just to point that out and clearly the supreme court i think now understands much of

under a budget we continue to grapple with these issues because here in the house of representatives weve passed numerous bills weve passed the repeal of the presidents health care bill and yet only to go on to the senate and not be taken up for a vote you heard my fellow women colleagues discuss how weve passed 15 bills on to the senate including the repeal with no action whatsoever the american people are calling for jobs the american people are calling for a change in our economy and those bills will take care of that issue those bills will set us on a path towards recovery and yet we continuously play politics on the senate side we dont bring these things for a vote were here tonight talking about all these issues that affect our families again our seniors our seniors are so concerned about whats going to happen in the future our seniors have paid into a system their entire life into social security and medicare they deserve those benefits back as a nurse taking care of seniors was part of my core health care life taking care of seniors and ensuring that theyre going to receive good care throughout the remainder of their life and theyve paid into that benefit willingly they paid into that benefit and deserve to get it back they dont look at medicare and social security as budgetary issues they look at these as benefits that they deserve and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that they receive them youve heard my fellow women colleagues reiterate over and over again that if you are 55 and older through our housepassed budget they will not be affected anyone 55 and older no benefit is changed whatsoever and yet in the senate that budget is not taken up for a vote the american people are looking for answers the american people know the issue they understand because we have made the point over and over and over again that medicare down the road just a few years down the road will be bankrupt because of the situation that were in today seniors are calling my office every day concerned that as republicans we are going to ruin medicare for them and that somehow theyre going to lose that benefit i can tell them honestly that is the last thing that any of us as republicans want to do in fact the problem lies with the presidents health care bill that was passed in the 111th congress because in that bill a half trillion dollars was taken out of medicare and put into place was a 15person panel which youve also heard my fellow colleagues discuss ipab independent payment advisory board fifteen individuals 15 bureaucrats will be able to decide what medicare will pay for and what they will not essentially taking away the patientdoctor relationship my husband is a surgeon i dont want my husband to have to sit down with his patients and discuss what they cannot do because medicare will not pay for it but that unfortunately is the future if we are not able to remove this if we are not able to repeal as we have already passed here in the house my fellow colleagues are working very hardvery hardto rescue medicare from the position that its in right now because it is doomed to failure but unfortunately this issue has been kicked down the road through previous administrations through previous congresses but we can no longer allow this to go on we have to address the issue now and i believe that our seniors understand this and i believe that if we can continue to give them this message that we are in no way wanting to harm the benefits that theyre receiving now or the benefits that they will be receiving if youre 55 and older we will be able to accomplish that but again the calls that are coming into my officethat i am more than willing and my staff is more than willing to answer these issuesneed to be going on to

affects thousands of americans each year i would like to take a moment to focus specifically on our veterans and the men and women who are currently serving in our united states military suicides are increasing at an alarming rate this year for our soldiers sailors airmen and marines recent data shows that suicides are occurring at a rate of approximately one per day for the military this makes suicide the secondleading cause of death for our troops surpassed only by combat the army in particular has seen a 22 percent suicide increase when comparing the first 7 months in both 2011 and 2012 but these are not just numbers and statistics these are real soldiers and real families impacted by this growing tragedy this increase became very personal for me again last weekend when i attended a memorial dedication for lance corporal bobby wiley lance corporal wiley was a lima company marine and the son of my classmate and friend as a result of bobbys death a loving family and nation grieve with loss on behalf of bobby and his family i stand before you today to briefly discuss this growing trend and associated symptoms as well as highlight prevention efforts within my district and nationwide by both the departments of defense and veterans affairs more than 2 million troops have served in the wars in iraq and afghanistan and thats a lot of people who have seen war up close and personal it can affect some of them adversely when they come back home in fiscal year 2009 alone 1 868 veterans of these wars made suicide attempts faced with the stigma of posttraumatic stress disorder unemployment rates tipping 12 percent for our veterans and a loss of the military camaraderie many veterans report feeling purposeless upon returning home we are aware of three conditions that contribute to many of the suicides of our veterans and they are posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd traumatic brain injury tbi and depression we know that veterans with these three medical conditions are at a higher risk of succumbing to suicide behavior as friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our country there are some things that we can do first recognize the symptoms that could lead to serious problems understand where and how to get assistance while still part of the military and know the availability of treatment after service as members of the veterans affairs subcommittee my colleagues and i on both sides of the aisle have had the opportunity to meet and discuss some of these very important issues and im pleased with secretary of the va shinsekis recent outreach efforts such as stand by them and side by side the purpose of the joint dod and va stand by them campaign and public service announcement side by side is to increase awareness with focus on support networks for military members detection and treatment are key components required for resolution those closest to the military member can often see signals of distress before the member recognizes it himself or herself the quicker the detection the quicker the treatment yesterday i joined back in my home district director costie and dr napp at the dayton va medical center to bring awareness to suicide prevention month with a large geographic span of responsibility in my district the dayton va medical center provides services to veterans from 16 counties during the joint press conference at the va we announced the ongoing efforts and helped in the promotion of the va and dod programs i know communities across our nation are doing similar awareness and education programs as our young men and women are fighting to protect our freedoms while theyre often faced with multiple and lengthy employments exposed to stressful situations in combatincluding deathwe cannot look the other way and hope that these issues disappear the reality is we are faced with a growing number of ptsd tbi depression and suicide within our military and veterans this is a real problem and if we can alleviate one of the symptoms and causes of suicide ptsd we may see a change in the current trendline before the problem becomes completely systemic across our fighting force let

afford to fund programs that are fully capable of standing on their own this is not about the ideology of npr executives or the content that npr produces but whether in this age of trilliondollar annual deficits taxpayers should subsidize a nonessential entity plain and simple this bill accomplishes three things first it prohibits public radio stations from using federal funds to purchase programming current federal law requires that about 26 percent of federal grants to public radio stations be used for the production or acquisition of programming many stations use these restricted grants to purchase programming from npr these programming fees are the largest single source of npr revenue at 56 million in fiscal year 10 second h r 1076 prohibits stations from using federal funds to pay npr dues in fiscal year 10 over 400 member stations paid a total of 2 8 million in dues to npr third my bill prohibits direct federal fundings of national public radio for fiscal year 10 npr received over 5 million in direct funding from the corporation for public broadcasting departments of education and commerce and the national endowment for the arts these three sources of revenues i just described totaled about 64 million in fiscal year 10 local public radio stations would not be able to use federal tax dollars under this bill to purchase content whether its from npr or any other vendor however under this bill a station could use other dollars for the payment of npr dues or the acquisition of programming should this bill become law the prohibition of funds would take effect immediately but the real issue today is the proper role of the federal government with national public radio and whether government programs and services that can be funded privately should receive taxpayer dollars we live in an age of digital radio computerized digital streaming commercial allnews radio and radio talk shows many of which are also streamed on the internet or over satellite radio and these provide sources of news and opinion without federal taxpayer dollars npr should do the same with the national debt over 13 trillion the government should simply not continue to fund nonessential services and this bill is just one step long before any firings videos and executive comments at npr i sponsored legislation in congress to pull the plug on taxpayer funding for the corporation for public broadcasting nprs parent company as well as npr last year many of you will remember this issue came up as a youcut item and we voted in support of defunding last month this house passed h r 1 within that bill the corporation for public broadcastings unobligated funds for fiscal year 11 would be rescinded when you couple h r 1 with this bill h r 1076 we end up with taxpayers having to subsidize national public radio im a strong believer in the free market id like to see npr rework its business model and begin to compete for all of its income npr already receives a huge amount of funding from private individuals and organizations through donations and sponsorships npr can and should be entirely supported with private sources in my own state of colorado colorado public radio received in fiscal year 10 only 6 percent of its funding from the corporation for public broadcasting now according to this bill colorado public radio is still permitted to apply for and receive federal grants through the corporation for public broadcasting but they cannot use federal money for the npr dues or purchasing of content they could use the other 94 percent of their money to purchase program content will this potentially require them to review and reprioritize where money is spent im sure it will but will it kill its programming no way according to npr federal funding to supplement operations amounts to less than 2 percent of its annual budget some have said this congress should not bother with such a small amount of money only in washington would anyone say 64 million is not worth saving you have to start somewhere if youre truly serious about getting our fiscal house in order if congress cannot make difficult decisions in the small areas how can we even begin to tackle entitlements or other major programs if we look at the sting video that has received so much attention ron shuler admits that npr would be better off without federal funding there

the result of decisions that were made that do not treat with the respect they are entitled to the willingness of our men and women in uniform to serve they will do whatever it is we ask them to do our job is to give them a policy thats worthy of the sacrifice that they are always willing to make this war in afghanistan has been going on for 10 years it has morphed into the united states military and the united states taxpayer having the burden of building a nation in afghanistan that cant be done we know it cant be done but there is an unwillingness to have a reckoning in this congress and in this country to turn the direction of our national defense into fighting terrorism in a sensible way not nationbuilding in afghanistan so the central issue here is not just the money which ill address its not just the time that this war has been going on which ill address its the basic strategy this nationbuilding approach over 100 000 american troops in afghanistan over 110 000 contractors does that make sense when the enemy that were fighting is decentralized and dispersed its not a nation state threat and the answer to that we all knowits common sense you dont have to be a

reauthorization bill both out of the house and to the point where we can get it to a conference committee so he said he is very frustrated with the process we are very frustrated with the process and today the extension that the majority is offering even frustrates us more because we know that this is an extension not a clean extension but it has a rider on it involving essential air services the debate today and the discussion about this extension is not about essential air service some members may support essential air service others may not support it theres been a lot said on the floor today about subsidizing a 3 000 subsidy per ticket just for the record we are not debating that that is to be taken up by conferees if we ever get to conference members can in fact have their opportunity to make changes in the eas program at that time it should not be a part of this extension but for the record let me say that in reference to an airport that was mentioned in montana it is actually 607 miles from denver to the denver airport so if you live in that community its not just a short drive to get in a rental car and drive to the denver airport also the nevada airport that was referenced from salt lake city you are talking 234 miles and the list goes on and on so thats an issue that we can debate at the appropriate time some changes may need to be made to the essential air service program but i think also we need to keep in mind were not just talking about passengers getting from point a to point b when theres hundreds and hundreds of miles to get to the nearest large hub airport to catch a flight but were also talking about moving medical supplies donor organs and a number of other things so its not just passengers and let me also say my friend mr mica mentioned as well that weve had an open process here well in fact we have not the process has not been open on this extension in fact the majority dropped the bill on friday without consulting the minority they did not consult with us about what may be in the extension in addition to that they went to rules committee and asked for a closed rule so that no member who might be affected by this legislation or might have an essential air service airport in their district that may want to go to the rules committee and in fact get an open rule or come to the floor to debate the merits of keeping their airport on the eas program they did not have that opportunity because the majority asked for a closed rule had the majority come to us in the minority and said we want a clean extension we want to move it forward we wouldnt be here today we in fact would probably have voice voted this extension it would have gone to the senate it would have been voice voted there and in fact we would have been a step closer to making certain that the faa is able to operate after the deadline on saturday finally let me say that we are frustrated because ive heard chairman mica say many times and as the ranking member mr rahall has said we have worked closely together we have done everything we can do in order to work together with mr mica and mr petri in order to get a bill but i have read reports and i have just heard mr mica say on the floor again today that you know we could wrap this conference up in 20 minutes and he said today we could wrap it up within an hour that there is only one issue that is remaining just for the record let me say if thats the case we have not been consulted on that one issue there are several issues and just for the record i would say major issues that have not been resolved on our side on the house side between the majority and minority let alone with the other body are one funding levels two essential air service three is repeal of the national mediation board rule four is the dca perimeter rule often referred to as slots other outstanding issues are occupational safety and health protection for flight attendants the 3hour rule for tarmac delays the lithium battery issue and the aircraft activity disclosure to the public the barr program and i have a list of other things to our knowledge that have not been resolved so when the chairman or others say that we could wrap this up in 20 minutes or in 1 hour i dont believe that is the case in fact i know its not the case we have not been consulted or negotiated to the extent that we could reach an agreement among ourselves on the house side let alone with our colleagues over in the other body so let me just say that its a disappointment to me we have worked closely together to move the faa extension on a permanent basis we are here on wednesday the faa extension in fact will expirethe faa will have to lay off employees this saturday if in fact this extension is not approved by both bodies and sent to the president and the senate has already told us that they are not going to accept this extension with this rider in fact in the extension they will approve the clean extension and its my understanding the other body is going to pass a clean extension and send it over here sometime today or by the end of the week it would be my hope that the majority would in fact accept a clean extension so that the faa can continue to serve the flying public and do all of the things that are essential to keeping the safest aviation system in the world as safe as possible so that we can begin to try and get a permanent bill and a longterm bill as well finally i would conclude by saying that we need to appoint conferees the senate has passed their bill in february of this year we have passed our bill in april and we are here now in the latter part of july and chairman mica is saying that all of these issues have been resolved but one and we do not even have conferees appointed so i would just encourage the leadershipranking member rahall and i have sent a letter to the speaker and to the leadership and to the majority saying look lets appoint conferees the senate has appointed conferees the only opportunity we had to appoint conferees in the last congress was in fact stifled and held up by the senate and frankly by two senators from the state of tennessee over one issue lets get the nonsense behind us there are things in the essential air program that i would like to see changed there are things in the bill that i would like to see us reach an agreement on the only way to do that is to get an extension passed so the faa can get past saturday and operate until september 16 it will give us an opportunity to appoint conferees so that we can meet with the conferees who have already been appointed in the other body to reach a permanent agreement the american people deserve better than what theyre getting today on the floor of this house and the american people deserve to know that we in fact are doing everything that we can to move forward to keep the safest aviation system in the world exactly thatthe leader in safety around the world so with that i ask my colleagues to vote no on this extension in the hopes that we could pass a clean extension i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0075331032276153564, 0.49246689677238464, 0, "today the supreme

minority member of the house armed services committee im actually pleased to stand before the house today in support of the rule as well as the underlying legislation which was h r 4310 and the

work and his steady leadership on this bill as well as the ranking member mr smith of washington for continuing the timehonored tradition of close cooperation and bipartisanship when it comes to defense and producing this conference report i also thank the professional staff which has worked closely together on literally hundreds of very difficult and often very technical issues and has done so cooperatively in an extremely responsible manner im very proud that the armed services committee produced a bill in a very bipartisan manner im proud of the floor of the house who voted and passed in a bipartisan way this bill back in may the senate has finally decided to pass the bill in december that the senate has passed a bill is commendable it is unusual but it is also commendable the fact that they have done this here gives us an opportunity of passing one of the few bills that must be done in every session of congress the senates procrastination on this effort is one of the things that is worrisome i only hope that in the years to come the senate majority leadership will return to acting expeditiously deliberately and in a more timely manner in something that is this important it is actually a testament to the competency and professionalism of the house armed services committee staff the house leadership staff and the rules committee staff that this enormous and complex conference agreement could be rescued at the end of what is becoming an otherwise contentious lameduck session in our rules committee meeting the other day we had the opportunity of having mr hastings and others refer to the constitution it is very significant that in the beginning of the constitution the preamble that we talked about creating a more perfect union a more perfect union is not a grammatical flaw that was introduced by the founding fathers it had a specific historical context it also talked about preserving or promoting domestic tranquility which had also a specific historical context which had nothing to do with america being sedate or tranquil it had something to do with the specific concept of private property it also talked about promoting general welfare even though they had a uniquely different idea of the word general than we have today but in providing in the intermediary with all these provisions is also the word that we are supposed to provide for the common defense it was not unusual that that word was in there put in by gouverneur morris and the rest of them when the founding fathers met to write our constitution they were looking at the historical milieu of the day and the concepts that were going on at that time they responded in a way to try to make sure that they solved the problems of the day in a way that would never come up again the concept of providing for the common defense became one of the core constitutional responsibilities that was extremely significant we had won the revolutionary war but we had alsoseveral of the statesviolated the treaty with britain the inability of some states to protect tory property had given the british the reason to continue to have armed british soldiers on american soil or british forts on american soil we could not under the articles of confederation control our borders the british were arming subgroups coming in here to do more than just destroy our domestic tranquility but also to take down and harm the lives of americans it seems some things never change but the articles of confederation and congress could not respond to this they had an army of only 700 people there was no navy to control the shipping or protect our shipping rights the articles of confederation and congress realized what we should also realize that if we do not have an adequate and strong defense not only can we not militarily defend this country but we dont have the ability of diplomatically trying to reach solutions to problems without resorting to military efforts they realized that this was one of the flaws of america when they wrote the constitution so it is not unusual for them to specifically put in here that one of the responsibilities that this house has is to provide for the common defense it is not unusual that in article i section 8 there are 17 clauses seven of those 17 clauses as well as the introduction talk about the necessity of military defense and military preparedness for this country they recognized how significant that was not just for defending militarily but also for the future and the diplomatic abilities of the future united states this bill deals with one of the few core constitutional responsibilities that we had fortunately over the past 51 years congress has been able to come together in an amazingly bipartisan way to come up with a defense authorization bill that provides our defense agencies the ability to function to train to equip our forces and to provide for our military personnel and their families we are betting if we do not do this that the largescale threats to our national security will be so far in the future we can just sort of tread water i hope sometimes that they are right but that treading would not be what the founding fathers would look at as providing for the common defense in a real world there would be what i would consider to be a more significant and effective bill but were not dealing with the real world we are dealing though with realworld issues part of the issue is that we are looking at a world that is extremely dangerous for uswe do not know what the future enemy will beand we are also dealing with a world in which we are continually trying to diminish our military presence our navy is smaller than it has been since 1917 our army will be smaller than it was at the beginning of world war ii our air force is the smallest it has ever been in the history of this country with the oldest planes that weve ever had those issues are issues that are significant they are important and they must be addressed and those are going to be ongoing longterm issues this particular bill does not do as much to address that particular problem and give us the security of the future as i wish it could do thats only because we are not dealing in a perfect world where we can establish the setting that we wish to do we have to deal with the setting in which we find ourselves having said that there are a lot of things in this particular conference report and in the housepassed bill which are very very positive and they do move us forward as we continue the discussion of this rule as well as the debate of the conference report on the floor we will talk about some of those things that are positive and that do move us forward with that i look forward to the continuing discussion about

and he is highly respected i would say that there are a lot of pressing problems in this country there is one ill speak about today and thats the highlevel nuclear waste storage throughout this country i would also say to my friend that part of the jobs bill has been passed we passed the free trade agreement we passed the veterans benefit portion we passed the 3 percent withholding so there has been movement in a bipartisan manner on some provisions in the bill so now let me segue to an issue for which ive come to the floor now six times that of going throughout the country and highlighting where highlevel nuclear waste is stored throughout this country today well travel to the state of massachusetts right on cape cod bay where the pilgrim nuclear power plant sits again its right on cape cod bay at pilgrim there are over 2 918 spentfuel assemblies on site yucca mountain which is the defined storage location by law in the 1982 nuclear waste policy act currently has no nuclear waste on site i like to keep highlighting the real distinct differences based upon the years of talking about this issue and highlighting some of the arguments against yucca comparing it to where we have nuclear waste today so lets again continue to look at the pilgrim nuclear power plant the waste is stored aboveground in pools very similar to fukushimadiachi in japan at yucca the waste will be stored 1 000 feet undergroundabove the ground in pools 1 000 feet underground i think yucca is a better location at pilgrim the waste is 20 feet from the water table at yucca it would be 1 000 feet above the water table i think thats a better safer and more secure location you can see the pilgrim plant is right on cape cod bay right next to the water yucca mountain is situated 100 miles from really the nearest body of water which would be the colorado river now for those who have been following my time in coming to the floor this is my sixth time i started at hanford a doe facility in washington state and compared it to yucca mountain i then went to zion ive got my friend from chicago right here zion is right on lake michigan which is a decommissioned nuclear power plant that still has waste stored on site but wisconsin has two nuclear power plants right on lake michigan then i went to savannah georgia to talk about the nuclear waste there of course it has the savannah river so its right next to the savannah river then i went out to california to look at san onofre the nuclear power plant thats right on the pacific ocean then i went to idaho and looked at the idaho national labs and the nuclear waste stored there today we go to massachusetts the point being there is highlevel nuclear waste stored all over this country and a single repository at yucca mountain makes sense for all of the right reasons its over 100 miles from the largest city its in the desert it would be underneath a mountain there is no more safe secure location why are we not moving forward because this administration has decided not to spend the money needed to finish the final environmental study through the nuclear regulatory commission so where are our senators on this position ive been bringing this down to the floor through all these states we need 60 votes in the senate to secure americas nuclear waste right now through the states based upon the states weve identified there are 20 yeses weve got about seven who are relatively new we dont know their positions of course we have established five who are noes there are some in the new england states that i mentioned susan collins voted for yucca mountain in 2002 olympia snowe voted for it in 2002 senator kerry voted against it now pilgrim is in the state of massachusetts based upon his statement i guess senator kerry feels that pilgrim is a more safe and secure location than yucca mountain scott brown has no position yet senator ayotte has no position senator shaheen has no position of course the

this fiscal year it seems to me that weve got three questions we ought to address in the course of this debate first and very elementally why are we here second what does the bill do and third what are the consequences if the bill isnt passed were here for the simple reason that the last congress that my good friends on the other side ran never passed a budget and never passed a single appropriations bill were here because the democratic majority failed to do its work were also here because the current democratic majority in the other body has so far failed to do its work i remind my colleagues we actually passed legislation and sent it over i also remind my colleagues that the one proposal in the senate that actually got the most votes was actually the republican h r 1 but nevertheless they failed to give us something to negotiate against its their obligation in the senate at some point to have a common negotiating position i dont know how we can sit down and negotiate otherwise so were here i think because of a democratic failure both in the last congress and this one second what does this bill do well its pretty commonsensical it cuts and reduces 25 programs saving 3 5 billion most of those programs the president and the majority say they dont want to continue it eliminates 2 6 billion in earmarks and by itself is one of the largest cuts any cr has ever administered as has been pointed out earlier if you combine it with the previous cr it is a very substantial cut indeed it buys time but it also keeps the government running and it keeps us on course to reduce spending at 2 billion a week something that my colleagues and i are committed to finally what happens if we dont pass this bill i know theres some that want to spend more some that want to spend less the first thing that happens is we shut down the government something all of us know is not a wise thing to do the second thing that happens is that we probably create financial panic in the country and harm a fragile economy finally the last thing that happens and i think actually the most important is we raise fundamental doubts amongst the american people as to whether or not this institution and we as elected officials have the capacity to actually address and solve our problems so i think we need to pass this bill we need to give our friends on the other side of the aisle particularly in the senate another 3 weeks to see if they can possibly come up with a negotiating position and im confident once those negotiations begin our speaker will keep the government running will bargain in good faith but will cut spending as were committed to do"]]}
