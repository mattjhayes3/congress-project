to combat domestic and dating violence sexual assault and stalking i am grateful to the committees on financial services energy and customers and education and the workforce as well as all of the members of the committee on the judiciary for working with us to make it possible to bring this legislation up today i would also like to thank the original bipartisan cosponsors of this bill judiciary committee ranking member conyers representatives green of wisconsin solis brownwaite schiff coble lofgren and weiner for all of their efforts authorization is an important oversight tool that allows congress and committees of jurisdiction to create amend extend and set priorities for programs within executive agencies despite the laws requirement for regular congressional authorization for the justice department until just recently doj has not been formerly authorized by congress since 1980 the committee on the judiciary took action to rectify the situation in the 107th congress and reauthorized the programs within the deprtment of justice we tried again last congress however the other body did not take up our bipartisan housepassed bill i am proud to be here today to provide congress with legislation to again give direction to the department of justice and the important programs it administers dojs grant programs are an important tool in the fight against crime in america programs such as byrne cops and stop provide grants to state and local governments to focus on current crime issues affecting our communities because there are limited resources continuous congressional oversight of these programs ensures that the taxpayers money is spent appropriately this bill will ensure accountability from the department with a number of provisions designed to ensure grant recipients are meeting the conditions established by congress for the programs the bill includes an office of audit assessment and management to monitor grants and a community capacity development office to assist grant applicants and grantees in meeting grant conditions in addition to the numerous oversight tools provided in the bill there are a number of important reforms to grant programs and provisions designed to improve those programs and offices within the department the bill consolidates the local law enforcement block grant program and the byrne grant program into one program with the same purposes to eliminate duplication and improve the administration of the grants the bill preserves the cops program but addresses concerns expressed by many members about the previous use of these grants h r 3402 also allows grantees greater flexibility in the use of these funds the authorization also reauthorizes doj programs that will expire or have expired such as the juvenile accountability block grant program and the sex offender management program it also includes some very important modifications to the criminal code such as extending the statute of limitations for human trafficking offenses and applying increased criminal penalties to prison guards who sexually abuse persons in their custody titles i through ix of this bill focus on reauthorizing expanding and improving programs that wefe established in the violence against women act of 1994 and reauthorized in 2000 the bill reauthorizes some important core programs such as stop grants and grants to reduce campus violence these programs have been successful in combatting domestic violence and changing attitudes toward violence in the family in america the reauthorization of vawa in 2005 will continue to change attitudes toward domestic violence and will expand its focus to change attitudes toward other violent crimes including dating violence sexual assault and stalking because these are crimes that affect both genders it is important to note that the text of the legislation specifies that programs addressing these problems can serve both female and male victims additionally this legislation specifies that the same rules apply to these funds that apply to other federal grant programs it is illegal to use grant funds devoted to these programs for political activities or lobbying it is the intent of congress that these funds be used to provided services to victims and trained personnel who deal with these violent crimes the department of justice is expected to enforce that provision for all its grants and monitor grant activities to ensure compliance not only with this condition but all conditions of the grants the legislation will aid congress

of course with the diligent work of our staffs on both sides of the aisle i think we have crafted a measure that maintains the integrity of the program while responding to the changes in the career and the technical education programs across the country while the president has chosen to put forward a proposal to dismantle this critical program we saw an opportunity to make high school matter for many young people offer college students pathways into productive employment and new hope for displaced homemakers and workers reentering the workforce the conference report before us signals that we will not retreat on our investment in career education and training the global economy demands a high skilled workforce and the perkins act has been instrumental in building todays workforce and the workforce of the future today these programs are changing in the face of secondary and postsecondary education and they equip americas workforce with the skills they need to compete in a global economy more important career tech programs acknowledge that we must be preparing students and adults for high wage high skill jobs that exist in this new economy to do this however we need a system that is challenging and academically sound and a system expands the secondary and postsecondary programs offering students a pathway toward those kinds of careers i am pleased that the conference agreement mirrors the recommendations we have heard that we must pay more attention to math and science and technology to increase our competitiveness we also know that this is what the high paying jobs require with these advanced skills the conference agreement continues the techprep program techprep has been a model of career and technical education with demonstrated outcomes in california students teachers and administrators benefit from the connections made between secondary and postsecondary programs and career and technical programs successful techprep programs offer a challenging and rigorous coursework at the high school level that is coordinated with postsecondary career technical programs and techprep students obtain better paying jobs because they have the academic and technical credentials that businesses want for their workforce we made important strides in the area of professional development this conference agreement strengthens the instructional connection between academic and career technical programs we heard from numerous teachers that successful career tech programs allow academic and vocational teachers to develop curriculums together to teach together so that students can apply the academic content to the real world context this conference agreement contains new measures of accountability for career and technical education systems i do not doubt that some programs may have difficulties in meeting this new system however there have been too many programs that have chosen the status quo to the detriment of our workforce competitiveness successful career and technical education programs produce students that outperform their counterparts and make higher wages we must demand that all programs work toward this same goal the accountability systems move us in that direction i want to point out two other areas where the conference agreement improves upon the house passed bill graduation and career plans under the agreement local programs may use perkins funds to create graduation and career plans for students these plans can be tools for students and parents to help focus the student on the students future goals making sure that the actions that we take will lead to the outcome they desire and also the special populations and nontraditional careers the conference agreement also strengthens the provisions and the gentlewoman from california has been a hawk on these issues for her entire career on this committee and that is to improve the opportunities for women and men to gain access to nontraditional careers and ensures that displaced homemakers and individuals with disabilities have access to career and technical education in this global economy we cant afford to waste the potential of any of our people and these provisions will help ensure that that doesnt happen the perkins act is a critical workforce development tool and the bill before us represents a sound career and technical education policy i want to thank our staff again for their efforts in bringing this conference agreement together and i look forward to a quick passage of this conference report and i also want to comment that this continues a long tradition in this committee where we have been able to work on a bipartisan basis on the most critical education issues confronting this country both in the development of high performing students and professional individuals and high performing career opportunities for those individuals and i want to thank all of my colleagues for their efforts on this legislation and urge

buried within h r 1815 is section 574 a provision that would severely limit the participation of women in our military to say that i am disappointed would be an understatement of enormous proportions some will say that section 574 merely codifies existing military policy but if this provision is passed we will be sending an entirely different message not just to the brave women currently serving our nation throughout the world but to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice those who have been wounded or even killed we will be telling them and indeed their families we have seen you at work defending freedom and liberty here at home and abroad and you arent good enough i cannot think of a more disgusting message to be sending our troops especially in a time of war this year the subcommittee on military personnel has not held hearings commissioned studies or released reports on this important issue in fact we have not seen a shred of evidence that a problem even exists with the integration of women in the armed forces yet the religious right wing in this country against the advice of our military leaders has once again decided to bend the process of government to their political will and force this issue upon america without research without fact without debate and without the benefit of the democratic process we are in the middle of a war in iraq and on terror now is not the time to be telling more than 20 000 women that we do not value their service especially when you consider that we are having serious problems meeting our recruitment goals what woman is going to join a military that treats them as if they are secondclass citizens not worthy of respect and dignity last night in the rules committee we watched as the coalition of members who stand rightly beside our women in uniform were slapped down on a partyline vote by the majority in their attempts to approve the skeltonsnyder amendment which would remove this illconceived provision from the bill the secretary of the army and the army vice chief of staff wrote the armed services committee voicing their strong opposition to this provision likewise we can have no real discussion on the future of americas defense without talking about the base realignment and closure process i share the concern of many experts and many of my colleagues across the political spectrum when i say that we are a nation at war now is not the time to be closing americas military bases many experts are also concerned that we are overconsolidating our resources in too few locations especially when the greatest threat to our security comes not from a massive invasion but from a sneak attack by a terrorist organization on a target of opportunity did we not learn after pearl harbor not to put everything in one place does it not make more sense to have our resources strategically placed across the country moreover as record numbers of guard and reserve troops are dying in combat defending this country the defense secretarys proposed brac list would ground a third of the nations air national guard and reserve units and shutter hundreds of other armories and readiness centers across the country many local leaders and homeland security specialists including the national guard association of the united states has said that the consolidation would hamper state responses to local emergencies and domestic terrorist threats unfortunately the dod did not adequately take into account a military installations value to homeland security when developing their criteria for example the niagara falls air reserve station has been recommended for closure despite the fact that it is the closest base to three major united states cities and the two largest cities in canada the guard and reserves who train there assist the department of homeland security in interrogating suspicious individuals detained at the northern border yet the air force proposes to reduce the air mobility command by 54 percent in the northeast incapacitating homeland defense in a region which comprises 20 percent of the entire united states population i understand this is also a problem for other major cities and population centers around the country that is why i offered an amendment last night that would have required the commission to evaluate bases for their homeland security value but unfortunately it was voted down all of us know that recruitment is another major issue that we are facing today we have a recruitment crisis in america and an armed forces already stretched way too thin but the dod wants to close bases that regularly exceed their recruitment goals for the guard and military reserves like niagara falls we do not know what will happen to the large guard and reserve units who serve at bases recommended for closure we know exactly where their equipment is headed but even the pentagon admits it does not know what is going to happen to our most valuable assets and those are the people stationed at the bases but perhaps what is most troubling about the brac list that was submitted to the commission is that according to an air force brac spokesman the extensive criteria used to evaluate the strategic military value of each base was not even adhered to by the pentagon when compiling their closure list 1045 instead they used a collective judgment i do not even know what collective judgment is supposed to mean but i know that in niagara thousands of people are losing their jobs and are at risk at a base that is highly ranked in performing its duties and one that has always been evaluated highly that is on the chopping block this is unacceptable to me and it should be unacceptable to this body this brac constitutes a complete reorganization of our military resources during a time of war with very little thought doing untold damage to the national guard and military reserves and does not consider the homeland security role but there are a lot of concerns about the pentagon that we have that we will not talk about today because we did not get enough amendments approved i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.45000046491622925,

throughout the world he said we would fight the enemy on their ground to prevent terrorists from once again attacking our citizens on unitedstates soil the bush doctrine stated any nation that

from radical extremists 59 percent of iraqi citizens exercised their right to vote in january and approximately 70 percent in december iraq is on its way to fully assuming responsibility for its own security and governance the challenges we face are undeniable and difficult president bush was correct when he said this war would come at great cost in blood and treasure however the cost would be much higherintolerably highhad we not decisively acted to protect the security and interests of the united states who can forget the cheering of iraqi citizens in the streets as baghdad was liberated

and beheads innocent civilians and seeks the destruction and overthrow of america our values our people our freedoms and our way of life we cannot allow al qaeda the opportunity to establish a permanent base in iraq from which to attack the united states the collapse of iraqs new democratic government would be a huge victory for al qaeda drawing additional recruits for bin ladens brand of

you and theres nothing you can do about it we may never know what has not happened because of this capability general ronald keyes head of the air forces air combat command rightly said if youre a

yield myself the balance of my time we are coming to the end of the debate on the final amendment in the way of a substitute i want to congratulate the gentleman from south carolina and the democrats for coming forward with a substitute it is never an easy thing to write a budget as we all know but i appreciate the fact that so many of our colleagues came forward with a budget the prime argument that is being made here today is first of all that the republicans seem to have caused the deficit number one and number two that the only way to get out of the deficit is to listen to the demo crats and increase taxes and increase spending so let me just take those because that is basically what the argument is first of all with regard to the deficit now maybe my memory is just fading but i am trying to remember back to before the world changed on september 10 of 2001 and we were running a surplus we had more money in the treasury in the federal treasury than we were paying out but we also discovered something that next morning on september 11 of 2001 we discovered that we were running some deficits that we did not know about because the balance sheet did not give us much perspective on it we were running a deficit in homeland security we were not protecting the country we were running a deficit in national defense we were not able to project our strength around the world and protect freedom we had a deep recession that we needed to climb out of that got a gut punch that morning and it lasted for quite a while longer so we made some very deliberate decisions that next day and days after in a bipartisan way we said it is time to reduce taxes stimulate the economy it is time to protect the country do whatever it takes it is time to fund our national defense it is time to protect our borders it is time to do all of these things and let us not ask the question today how we are going to pay for it let us do it and we did it and you voted for every one of those bills every single one do ndt shake your head i will show you the votes you voted for every single one of those bills to protect the country you protected the country with every single one of your votes so instead of coming down here today and blaming the republicans for partisan purposes why do you not remember the history you know that it is osama bin laden that had as much to do with this deficit as anybody in this country and instead of trying to get political points you ought to just relax and try and figure out a way to get out of it so this is how we decided to get out of it we said let us control spending let us stimulate the economy and look at what has happened as a result of that not only did the tax cuts not get us into that deficit but because of the work that we have done we are climbing out of it bjecause we are protecting the country because we are stimulating the economy and are creating jobs because of all of that we have the opportunity in this budget to reduce the deficit and build on the progress we had from last year last year we cut the deficit 20 percent 20 percent in one year with a growing economy and controlling spending and so we are starting on a glidepath reducing that deficit every year the deficit was not caused overnight it is going to take some time to get it down and we have a plan to accomplish that now i also want to put this deficit in some perspective you have got to compare the deficit to something you cannot just say 500 billion is a lot of money or 200 billion is a lot of money of course it is a lot of money but compared to what is it a lot of money compared to our economy is the measure that every single economist says you have got to compare it to and as you look at the deficit as it is compared to our economy you can see here that this year we are at 3 6 percent of our economy if we stick to this belt tightening that is responsible over time we will be able to get down to 1 percent of the economy and why is that important well first of all let me show you deficits in the past this is not even the biggest deficit we have ever run this is not the biggest deficit look back in 1946 after world war ii we were running a deficit that was 7 percent of our economy let us look to the year i first came to congress it was 3 9 percent of the economy back in 1990 when the gentleman from texas and i came to congress let us look back to the early eighties when we complained it was 5 percent we are talking about an economy that is chugging along and growing we are talking about a deficit plan that gets us below the rate of growth that we need to get to in order to have a responsible budget and we need to pass this plan and get on with business we do not need tax increases and we do not need more spending vote down

a scholarship at a m and my wife and i considered coming back to tyler judge steger was one of the first people i talked to about it judge steger was the father of reed steger and husband of ann steger and their son reed was one of my little brothers very best friends i learned a great deal from judge steger most people never did really come to know all that he had done and what he was but he was a dallas native originally he always wanted the opportunity to become a pilot and when the nation entered world war ii he took the chance on november 9 1942 he got his wings and after training he was sent to casablanca and flew 56 combat missions for which he received an air medal and four oak leaf clusters while later training other pilots captain steger also tested the first unitedstates jet airplanes if judged only by his service here he would be counted as a hero but he was much more than that once his nation was secure bill steger went back to school received his law degree from

was running for president after the election president eisenhower appointed judge steger in 1953 to the position of unitedstates attorney for east texas at the very young age of 32 judge steger was up

dedicated cerebral nononsense constitutional constructionist judge whose discerning intellect could always cut straight to the heart of any issue i know i tried cases in front of this great judge in 1987 judge steger assumed senior active status duty but since there still needed cases to be handled judge steger stepped in and stood in the gap december 1 2005 marked 35 years on the federal bench for judge steger since his appointment in 1970 he had handled more than 15 000 cases judge steger not only made his home in tyler texas a better place but he changed texas politics in 1960 he and a good friend debated as to which one should run for governor and which one should run for senator their goal was to bring the republican party into popularity in the state of texas because texas was conservative it seemed to judge steger that it would be a good fit but he was blazing a trail he ended up being the one to run for governor against a very popular john connolly judge stegers good friend named john tower ran for senator the republican party had never received enough votes to hold a primary and even though judge steger knew he couldnt win the race he hoped he would get the requisite 200 000 votes so the republican party could hold a primary in the next election judge steger actually received more than 600 000 votes that year texas then became eligible to begin having republican primaries because of judge steger always having the courage of his convictions despitethe odds against him judge steger was a profile in courage whose memory will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life at the 2004 tyler law day judge steger received the justinian award for his community service his legal ethics and professionalism he was a baptist a baptists baptist he was a

has only grown more difficult and our capacity to meet that threat actually has diminished it is one of the reasons many of us opposed that action against iraq there is no question irans president is a thug an antisemite and a dangerous man he exploits iranian national grievances to consolidate power and has openly 6xpressed his desire to wipe israel off the map well our troops are bogged down in iraq placing them at risk should iran launch a wave of terrorism we have done nothing to break our global dependency on oil the control of which gives iran its greatest ability to blackmail other countries now i appreciate the good will and passion of the sponsors of this bill bringing a critical issue before us i rise in opposition however we have been at this point before we passed an earlier version of this bill the senate rejected it as an amendment to the defense authorization i appreciate that there have been some positive changes that have been made to this legislation one is a sunset the earlier bill would have made it permanent and i appreciate that it contains a provision that i authored that would prohibit assistance to groups who had appeared on the state departments list of terrorist groups in the last 4 years however the problem is nothing in this legislation points us in the direction of a solution it is if you will a cruise missile aimed at a difficult diplomatic effort just as they are reaching their most sensitive point the timing for this legislation could not be worse while the united states has largely been missing in action from the diplomatic game the european union and iran have been making progress at developing a formula that would lead to the suspension of irans nuclear enrichment program and the start of serious negotiations this bill specifically targets russia which may have some influence with iran and which is critical to a unified diplomatic front this bill has another fundamental flaw besides sanctioning people whose help we need to reach a diplomatic solution it gives equal weight to overthrowing the iranian government as it does to nonproliferation these two goals work against each other yes the regimes human rights record is atrocious but preventing them from developing nuclear weapons should be our first priority by not prioritizing behavior change over regime change we pull the rug out from anyone in the iranian leadership who values survival over the nuclear program and eliminates incentives for diplomatic solutions now in my opinion iran holds if not the key a key to many of the issues that confound us in the middle east their cooperation ultimately is going to be critical if we are going to be able to deal with the mess that our policies have created in iraq the problems that we are facing in afghanistan with a resurgence of the taliban and it is going to play a key role on issues that deal with israel hezbollah and hamas they are like a puzzle and sadly iran is one of the missing pieces after september 11 when the united states took action to overthrow the taliban our interests and irans aligned and we ere able to coordinate quietly but effectively they were partners with us at some tough sessions in bonn when we were having the negotiations that set up the afghanistan government and in the midst of this tentative effort at cooperation president bush decided to declare iran part of the axis of evil and most hope for progress disappeared the irony is that iran is one of the few nations in the world where the majority of the people still have a positive view of the united states this is difficult it is not easy but to simply sanction potential partners and confuse what our priorities are i am sad to say is going to be a step backward we ought to make clear to iran that they need to stop their support for terrorism end development of nuclear capacity and begin the process of free fair and open elections but i am sorry to say that this legislation in front of us ignores the opportunities that we have incorporating the lessons we learned in our success with libya i respectfully suggest that this is legislation that we ought to reject and that we ought to instead prioritize what our goals are with iran and we are going to by all means have our sanctions but not be reckless in terms of the pressure we try to exert against the very people who are going to be necessary to help us with a diplomatic solution to prevent nuclear proliferation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00036209821701049805, 0.5003620982170105, 1, "i yield myself such time as

august 5 2005 pujols became the first player in major league history to hit 30 or more home runs in each of his first five seasons on august 31 2005 he became the first major league player since ted williams to have 100 runs batted in during each of his first five seasons originally from the dominican republic it was in the united states that pujols developed his love for baseball and demonstrated his ability for the game he batted over 500 during his first season of high school baseball at maple woods community college in the kansas city area pujols showed off his talent by hitting a grand slam and recording an unassisted triple play during his first game and by batting 461 during his first season the st louis cardinals drafted pujols in the 13th round of the 1999 draft he initially turned down a 10 000 bonus and opted to play in the jayhawk league in kansas by the end of the summer the cardinals had increased their bonus offer to 60 000 pujols signed with the cardinals and was assigned to the minor leagues by the next year he was playing for single a team the peoria chiefs where he was voted league most valuable player pujols progressed quickly through the ranks of the st louis farm system and on to the major leagues the 2005 season saw pujols establish career highs in walks and stolen bases while leading the st louis cardinals in almost every offensive category he finished with a 330 batting average a 430 onbase percentage and a 609 slugging percentage 41 home runs a grand slam 117 rbis 97 walks and 16 stolen bases the cardinals were eliminated during the national league championship series but only after pujols hit a memorable home run in game five a twoout threerun blast in the top of the ninth inning off houston astro closer brad lidge after the season pujols received his first national league most valuable player award which underscored his critical role in keeping the injuryplagued cardinals on track throughout the season pujols
