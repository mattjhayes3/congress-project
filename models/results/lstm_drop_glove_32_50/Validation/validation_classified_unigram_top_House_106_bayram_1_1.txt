that he has put into this measure let me say that as i listened to my fellow californian talk about this measure it sounded as if he was disturbed over the fact that we are not moving in the direction of establishing a national health care plan that really seems to be the goal that a number of people have moving towards single payer what this bill does specifically is it provides incentives for people to plan and create more choices when it comes to the area of health care it provides a substantial deduction for expenses related to longterm care it provides deductibility for the purchase of longterm care insurance policies it provides an immediate 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the selfemployed and it provides health care deductibility for those who purchase health care outside of their employer the idea here is to provide a wider range of choices rather than getting the government more and more involved in the issue of health care let me talk about a couple of other very important provisions in this measure sitting over here is my good friend the gentleman from ohio he has worked long and hard as the gentleman from georgia said in his opening statement to

uncertainties agricultural producers face on a regular and notsoregular basis it is hardly surprising that dairy farmers would rather not add another unknown quantity to the list of things with which they must concern themselves also there is a natural tendency to fear the unknown simply because it is unfamiliar but while it may be tempting to think that the devil you know is preferable to one that you dont there is a problem with that line of reasoning in this instance should it prevail today members of this body may have a devilishly difficult time explaining much less justifying it in the future that being the case i would urge my colleagues to consider some facts and figures before they cast their vote on h r 1402 most obvious not to mention significant is the fact that our current system of milk marketing orders and price differentials is over 60 years old a relic born long before the interstate highway system came into being or refrigeration trucks made their presence felt back then the argument went as follows for americas children to be able to drink wholesome fresh milk every day dairy farmers had to be in business nearby but now the circumstances are entirely different not only can milk be shipped safely over long distances but in many cases it can be obtained from outofstate more cheaply than from neighboring sources as a consequence what once may have benefited youngsters now adds to the price their parents pay for their milk estimates of the cost of the present milk pricing system to consumers start at 674 million per year with several approaching or even exceeding 1 billion annually not only that but if milk price supports are extended for another year as h r 1402 now provides and the existing milk pricing system is essentially retained americas taxpayers will be adversely affected as well because those provisions of h r 1402 will keep the price of milk consumed by participants in this nations food stamp child nutrition and supplemental feeding programs they will not realize approximately 53 million a year in savings that should result from implementation of the usdas final rule on milk marketing orders and price differentials also there is evidence that dairy farmers themselves would not benefit as much as they might expect if h r 1402 becomes law according to a recent estimate extrapolated from data developed by the university of iowas farm and agricultural policy research institute fapri 59 of americas dairy farmers would fare better if the usdas final rule takes effect that last figure in particular is a telling statistic but it is by no means the only reason it would be best to reject h r 1402 for the sake of americas dairy farmers even more compelling to my way of thinking is the potentially negative impact enactment of h r 1402 could have on the prospects for enhancing the export of american agricultural products in the years ahead as i need hardly remind my colleagues this nations agricultural producers have been disproportionately disadvantaged by foreign trade barriers for many years now that being the case a key objective in the next round of trade negotiations is to achieve greater market access for all united states exports of agricultural commodities and valueadded foods but how successful can we be in achieving that objective if we are perceived to be asking other nations to do things we are unwilling to do ourselves let me be a bit more specific from my vantage point as chairman of the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee it appears that the provisions of h r 1402 run directly counter to the negotiating objectives of the united states in those upcoming trade talks which get underway in seattle on november 30th of this year instead of telling our wouldbe trading partners that we practice what we preach those provisions would give them ammunition they could use to resist opening their markets to our exports in the past countries with the most troublesome trade barriers have tried to shield their unfair trade practices by continuing to define them as being within the blue box category of export subsidies that are beyond the reach of multilateral disciplines if we insist on maintaining market distorting pricing mechanisms and commodity subsidies of our own as h r 1402 would do those countries will see little reasonand have no incentiveto change their position the result markets for american agricultural products will not open up as we would like the promise of the 1996 freedom to farm act will not materialize as we have hoped and american farmers will not be as well off as they have expected mr chairman and colleagues i trust we will not make that mistake for the sake of the consumer the taxpayer and yes the dairy farmer himself or herself i hope we will not go down the antiquated outofdate inconsistent with the free market path that h r 1402 would take us rather than cling to a past that was not all that kind to dairy farmers anyway let us look to the future and to the prospect of larger more efficient markets not just for dairy products but for all the exportable agricultural goods produced in this country we have the land the skill the experience and the technology to feed not just ourselves but people all over the world at prices few if any others can match indeed we are truly blessed and it would be a shame if we did not count our blessings and put them to the best possible use not exclusively to serve the interests of agricultural producers but also to benefit those who process distribute sell prepare and or consume all kinds of agricultural commodities i urge my colleagues to vote no on h r 1402 so that the usdas final rule on milk marketing orders can take effect on october 1st of this year that rule may not be perfect but compared to status quo alternative contemplated by h r 1402 it is a significant step in the right direction"], [0.45823806524276733,

the teachers of america the public school the private school teachers who work so hard and contribute so much to the wellbeing of the children of this nation today however i want to rise in recognition of a particular part of that educational establishment that is not often recognized and it was brought to my attention again although i have long been aware of its existence but it was brought to my attention again by a card i received in the mail not too long ago here it 1s a little handwritten handdrawn and coloredin star here it says thank you thank you thank you it goes all the way around thank you very much it is from a young man named jerrod padinama it says dear mr tancredo thank you for giving us the privilege of home schooling my home school coop is studying the constitution and it is fun i am 9 years old i am in the third grade i am praying for you jerrod padinama well jerrod thank you for your prayers i sincerely appreciate them but i tell my colleagues this is really a very touching little card i received and i have been holding on to it because i wanted to reference it in a way the neat part is that this young man would take the time to send me this little card and draw it in but in a way it is a sad commentary because he has to tell me thank you for letting me be home schooled and he does know intuitively i suppose and certainly his parents are well aware of the fact that often there are attempts in this body and certainly in legislatures all over the country and states all over the nation to actually restrict the ability of parents to actually teach their children at home and they have to say thank you to us for letting them have a right that frankly is as natural as breathing a right of a parent to teach their child at home this is as if this is a strange anomaly this is something weird that we do in this country that they have to be allowed to do by the legislature and that is the only kind of negative part of this thing i see because otherwise it is a very beautiful thing i just wanted to point out that home schooling certainly preceded any other kind of schooling we had in the united states of america and it did very very well and it continues to do very very well and it is an expanding phenomena many many people are participating in this it is growing astronomically almost beyond really ways to describe it i find in my own state of colorado that there are thousands and thousands of parents who are taking on the responsibility of teaching their children at home recently i received a copy of an article that was written by a gentleman by the name of steven archer and he details a study that was just done by larry rudner who is the leading statistician at the university of maryland he studied home schoolers and what it comes down to is this he said regarding the results of this research rudner said the bottom line of the study is that the 20 000 homeschool students i studied were doing extremely well in terms of their scores on the iowa test of basic skills in fact the median test scores for homeschooled children who participated in this study were in the 75th and 85th percentile range this is exceptional compared to the national average which by definition is the 50th percentile based on the performance of children in the public schools which rudner explained deviates little from that value home schoolers also did significantly better than their private school counterparts based on catholic school norms where the median scaled scores were in the 65th to 75th percentile range according to rudner major findings in the study include the following almost onequarter of homeschool students are enrolled one or more grades above their agelevel peers in public and private schools it goes on but i would just say that it verifies what we already know about home schooling and that is that it works it works in an academic sense it works in a social sense and i want to take the opportunity here today to thank jerrod for his card to thank jerrods parents for giving him the opportunity to be home schooled and to thank all those thousands and thousands perhaps millions of

also thank the gentlewoman from ohio and the gentlewoman from ohio for this legislation that i had the pleasure of cosponsoring the focus of the amendment that i am offering is to emphasize the heinousness and the tragedy of child sexual abuse so my amendment offers to clarify that child abuse includes child sexual abuse and this will add to the information that the child abuse workers will be able to secure and to be able to investigate in order to determine whether there has been child sexual abuse let me emphasize why this is an important distinction because most often when we think of child abuse we think of the physical abuse that may be noticeable the knocked head the bruised arm the broken arm the brokenleg the burn on the body physical things that can be seen by a school counselor a teacher a friend or a pastor but sometimes children suffer in the quietness and the horror of sexual abuse that cannot be detected by looking at a child fully clothed and the idea is to ensure that in this new legislation we have a circumstance where this is on the minds of those child abuse investigators should they not also inquire look examine and determine whether the child has been sexually abused let me cite the numbers of sexually abused children the numbers are going up in 1990 there were 127 000 children abused sexually in 1991 it goes up 129 425 when we go to 1992 sexual abuse goes 130 000 14 percent 1993 139 000 each year the number of children sexually abused increases when we look at close to 3 million children who are reported abused we find that 12 percent of them suffered sexual abuse might i offer to those who are able to i guess tolerate hearing about the horrificness the heinousness about what happens when a child is sexually abused by citing the report on the autopsy of jonbenet ramsey a case that still stands as one of the singular cases of terrible child abuse and of course an unsolved murder of a child what the autopsy says is that this particular child was found to have been whacked her head was whacked against something and then she was still alive and strangled the autopsy goes on to note there are two injuries in that autopsy that could have killed her one is a strangulation the other is the assorted brain injuries it is not clear in what sequence meyer found an abrasion on the girls hymen which other experts said could indicate a sexual assault the size of the girls hymen which meyer measured at 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter should have more significance the thing that concerns me is that the hymenal opening is measured at 1 centimeter which is too large said kirschner a child abuse specialist but if in fact that was the real measurement that is twice the diameter that it should be usually a hymen in a young child like this should be 4 millimeters and so there was discussion horrible discussion about whether or not jonbenet ramsey was sexually abused there is blood and contusions in the vagina and the hymen has been torn yes descriptive horrific but every day our children face this kind of assault so i think it is extremely important that this language emphasizes the protection of our children as the legislation already does but it emphasizes a real focus on sexually abused children along with other abuse it does not in any way diminish the importance of other abuse but realizes that children can suffer in silence with child abuse and it cannot easily be detected i would hope that my colleagues would support this amendment because it again states to our child abuse investigators be thorough in your work do not be limited in your work and realize that our children suffer in silence when they are sexually abused and you need to inquire and draw from them the information that will protect and save the lives of american children i have an amendment that i would like to offer to this bill in its present form this bill has a tremendous impact on the current abuse and neglect system by enhancing the services available this amendment i am offering would give child protective and child welfare workers additional access to criminal records that would include convictions for sexual abuse according to the statistics on abuse 12 percent of the abuse is sexual abuse any discussion of child abuse is incomplete without including the growing problem of child sexual abuse and exploitation child sexual abuse is any sex act performed by an adult or an older child this includes actual physical abuse such as touching a childs genital area or molestation and it also includes sexual assault selfexposure flashing voyeurism and exposing children to pornography sexual abuse is often committed by a family member incest is the most common form of child sexual abuse however anyone can commit sexual abuse against a child it is often perpetrated by adults that have been entrusted with caring for a childa family friend babysitter a teacher day care worker or even religious leaders even a child can commit sexual abuse against another child the purpose of my amendment is to specify the importance of sexual abuse as a crime that should be recognized by child welfare and child protection workers when investigating incidences of child abuse it gives protection and child welfare workers access to the conviction records and orders of protection based on sexual abuse in addition to domestic and child abuse a history of sexual abuse whether it is against a child or an adult is significant information sexual abuse against children is a harsh reality that is very common at least one out of five adult women and one out of ten adult men report having been sexually abused as children these cases may represent the untold stories of many children now adults who suffered in silence due to sexual abuse now we have mechanisms in place to investigate inciclences of child abuse however in some cases certain information about an alleged abusers past may not be available this bill remedies that situation by making criminal records for sexual abuse available in texas there were more than 111 000 investigations of child abuse and neglect by the child protective services

requested i remain concerned that too much defense spending means not enough investment in education health care and the needs of our children second the bill authorizes 2 2 billion for the initial phases of a national missile defense system i am concerned that the authorization of these funds could encourage a premature decision on the deployment of a national missile defense system i dont believe that it is an accurate statement to sayas the bill doesthat the national missile defense act of 1999 entails a commitment by the president to deploy such a system in fact this was conditional on feasibility and on whether we are able to deploy in the context of other arms agreements i am convinced it would be irresponsibleas well as strategically disadvantageousfor us to make a unilateral move toward an inadequately tested defensive system earlier this year i wrote to the president urging that he not make a deployment decision based on politics instead of on diplomacy and technical feasibility and without weighing considerations of cost the same holds true for congress the house rejected a proposal to simply close the school of the americas instead the bill will replace it with

modernization conference report this complicated and controversial legislation seeks to overhaul banking laws that have been in existence in our country since the great depression these laws were dedicated to safety and soundness in the banking system of the united states the laws that have been on the books for this entire century since the great depression have separated the activities of bankers of the insurance industry and of the securities and stock brokerage industries essentially what this legislation attempts to do is to allow them to intermarry and to do business together now i recently did a survey in my district and i asked our constituents the following question how would you describe your personal views of bank practices twothirds stated that they disliked the changes that have been occurring in the banking system they say the fees are not consistent with the services provided services are declining and most of our banks are no longer locally owned if we think to the system that has been in place in this country that has permitted us to grow and to increase equity for americas families the epitome of this system was the community bank and in fact the community banker became an active member of the local chamber of commerce in every neighborhood in every city and banking became equated with stability what we have seen happen in the banking system of our country and it has been happening slowly slowly slowly we have watched communities like my own toledo oh become a branch economy of an institution located someplace else and when that happened community contributions to boy scouts by those institutions went down to childrens softball teams and so foruh the community contributions the philanthropy of that institution and the personal identification of the president of the institution with the community as a whole diminished in addition to that we have seen the idea of safety and soundness changed fundamentally to where now most of these institutions have turned into highflying debt pushers trying to get consumers to take on more credit than they can afford in fact last week when i got home from congress and i opened my mail i got so mad i ripped this letter up because this came from an institution that does business in ohio and what did it have it had one of these 5 checks attached that says that if you cash this and sign up for our program we will send you 5 but what was i to sign up for here is a banking institution pushing more credit on the commercial side to me a depositor in that institution they want me to sign up for shoppers advantage over 250 000 brand items travelers advantage again credit to travel concierges service savers club discount book in other words they are pushing debt pushing debt through the banking system at our consumers now this is a fundamental change in the way that our country used to operate in the field of banking and credit in some ways these lending institutions if we can call them that are not so much interested in building communities as in milking communities and in taking money that should be placed in those depositors accounts so that they can end up owning a piece of the rock rather than assuming these greater and greater debt burdens that are characterizing family accounts across this country here is a recent chart on the rising level of consumer debt in our country the average family cannot survive more than 3 months without getting their paycheck in the mail because of the debts that they owe yet these institutions that are supposed to be dedicated to safety and soundness are into pushing more credit not in the interest of community building but in the interest only of profits of those institutions we have seen megafinancial conglomerates and mergers across our country and this bill will only add new hurdles to the already difficult task for consumers obtaining basic financial services without incurring outlandish and arbitrary fees further consumers will be forced to speak with more 1800 recordings how many of us have got lost in those when we try to get an answer out of a banking institution in this country and very pricey automatic teller machines rather than dealing with human beings this is happening across our country the fundamental precept of any banking laws in this country should be safety and soundness not highflying credit pushers i rise today to outline my concerns with this conference report i believe americas fiscal fitness is in jeopardy as we enter the next millennium are we really prepared for the challenges that lie ahead i am concerned about the growing trend toward mergers and acquisitions throughout americas banking industry these massive consolidations most recently seen with the merger of nations bank and bank of america will likely result in fewer financial service options and fewer altematives for consumers when it comes to shopping for life insurance checking accounts and investments transactions the megafinancial conglomerates created by this bill will only add new hurdles to the already difficult task of obtaining basic financial services without incurring outlandish and arbitrary fees further consumers will be forced to speak with 1800 number recordings and sent to pricey automatic teller machines rather than dealing with human beings consumer spending makes up

does little to discourage the growth of bigger higher fee banks leading to less consumer choice and higher fees for all americans there are also privacy concerns that are not addressed in this bill the bill allows for sharing between megabank affiliates which can only lead to more of the solicitations like this one that i received over the weekend from key bank the bill does not allow a customer to optout if a financial institution wishes to distribute the customers information to affiliates within the financial holding company is it too much to ask for a customer to have the right to optout and inform his or her financial institution that it may not distribute his or her personal private financial information to financial institutions i am aware of the tremendous work on the part of the

small event involving the loss by the federal government of an amount of money that would be considered gargantuan in every respect except its relative size to the united states government budget given all the budget decisions involving issues like medicare defense spending and u n funding this congress should be aware that threequarters of 1 billion has just become obligated outside the budget process because of regulatory laxness related to the failure of one rural bank the first national bank of keystone west virginia the facts revealed to date suggest that this failure may cost the bank insurance fund far more than the federal deposit insurance corporation estimated the fund would lose from all bank failures this year indeed the expected loss is so high that it could make keystone not only one of the 10 most expensive bank failures ever but also one of the most spectacular for any institution of any size with losses approaching an astounding 70 percent of the banks assets the public first learned of the failure of first national bank of keystone september 1 1999 when the office of the comptroller of the currency occ announced it was closing the bank and appointing the fdic as receiver bank examiners had discovered that loans on the banks books totaling 515 million were missingitems that represented roughly half the banks 1 1 billion in total reported assets other overstated assets questionable accounting practices and credit quality problems push the total expected losses toward the 750 million dollar mark the picture that is emerging is of an institution which in recent years reported high profits at the same time management pursued dubious investment strategies and ultimately mischievous techniques to hide massive losses from the scrutiny of examiners it will take some time for criminal investigators and federal bank regulators to unravel the full story of this bank failure but it is not too early to ask if federal regulators properly supervise the institution and prudentially stewarded the deposit insurance fund which backstops risks in the banking system for 5 or 6 years red flag practices should have alerted regulators that the highrisk asset management strategies employed by keystone were hardly of the kind expected in a rural institution situatedin a west virginia town of 627 residents and warranted vigilant supervisory measures from 1992 to 1998 keystone increased its assets tenfold to over 1 billion as it offered depositors up to 2 percentage points more in interest than competitor institutions rather than expanding small business and agricultural loans in its west virginia market area keystone engaged in a highrisk strategy of buying securitizing and selling subprime loans made to and by people the bank hardly knew management practices were reminiscent of those witnessed during the s l crisis of the 1980s rapid asset growth risky investment activity and the practice of paying hypercompetitive interest rates were augmented by legal and administrative tactics designed to thwart regulatory oversight a combination of lax management and weak supervision by the banks board were conducive to the imprudent and allegedly fraudulent activities that have been uncovered over the past several years the occ made futile attempts to curb keystones gogo activities with various enforcement actions and civil money penalties but in hindsight the measures were too weak and too late the occ pushed for management changes but the banks board resisted several experienced officers were hired in 1999 however the board gave them the cold shoulder and they quickly resigned in may of 1999 an external accountant grant thornton conducted an independent audit as required by the occ and issued an unqualified opinion of the banks 1998 financial statements the firm detected no fraud just a few months later however federal examiners found that a halfbillion dollars were missing from the banks claimed assets the delay in uncovering the losses apparently occurred in part because bank management engaged in a sustained pattern of obfuscation another tactic of keystone management was not unlike that employed 15 years earlier by charles keating one of the hallmarks of the keating tenure to the s l called lincoln was the hiring of many highpowered attorneys to represent his interests when challenged keating and his people had a habit of threatening regulators and the united states government with lawsuits in keatingesque fashion keystone went so far as to hire a former comptroller of the currency to contest the occs supervisory activities in an escalated twist examiners on bank premises were so harassed and felt so threatened that the occ had to request united states marshals to protect them when they were going over bank records in addition to similarities with respect to the 1980s gogo activities of s ls that cost american taxpayers approximately 140 billion the keystone case adds new elements the profile of questionable bank leadership is no longer simply the smoothtalking male huckster but it would now appear that keystones cops federal banking authorities were taken in by a scam perpetrated by an institution headed by a grandmother with the threats to examiners and recent discovery that three truckloads of bank documents were buried on the property of a senior bank official indictments have been issued for obstruction of a federal examination an unusual legal precept which some may find humorous others chilling keystones failure has not only revealed costly inadequacies at the field supervisory level but also flaws in interagency cooperation in washington for this reason i have today introduced h r 3324 a bill designed to bolster the independence of the federal deposit insurance corporation by background state chartered banks are regulated primarily by state banking agencies with the federal reserve erving as the primary federal regulator for state members national banks are regulated by the occ and holding companies of all banks are regulated by the federal reserve analogously state agencies regulate state chartered savings and loans and the office of thrift supervision ots serves as the federal thrift regulator the fdic is a backup regulator for all federallyinsured institutions banks and s ls because it is responsible for stewardship of the deposit insurance system it is also the primary federal regulator for state chartered banks which are not members of the federal reserve system in order to avoid to the maximum extent possible duplicative regulation the regulators are expected to cooperate and coordinate their examination activities on the whole this cooperation works well in part because americas banking system is so strong but just as there is private sector competition for profits there can at times be public sector competition for power in this case regulatory jurisdiction from a congressional perspective the keystone failure is worrisome because it appears that the fdic was stymied at key points in its desire to conduct reviews of the banks activities the regulatorsthe occ and the fdicfailed to cooperate closely although satisfactory communication among the fdic the occ and other federal regulators in routine cases appears to be the norm the keystone case reveals some potentially serious flaws in the federal oversight system the tension between the occ and the fdic over keystone was particularly evident in the period leading up to the 1998 examination of the bank instead of welcoming fdic expertise and assistance in analyzing the increasingly complex operations of the bank the occ initially denied the fdics request to participate in a bank examination the occ says its decision was based in part largely on concerns that the inclusion of additional fdic examiners might exacerbate the increasingly difficult environment for the examiners at the bank and heighten managements resistance to examiners requests for information retired examiners like old soldiers and athletes sometimes have a tendency to exaggerate reminiscences in a discussion about keystone one opined to me the other day that the old rule was if a bank ever displayed reluctance in cooperating with examiners a swat team of accountants should immediately be brought in and if intransigence continued the bank should immediately be closed this perspective may be callously insensitive to law and to a system where agencies because of their extraordinary authority have an obligation to act with great caution but one truth is selfevident bank intransigence is a reason for more not fewer examiners in this regard it is noteworthy that the occ itself has acknowledged that by september of 1997 it considered keystones extensive problems required a significant amount of examiner expertise for it then to suggest that its objection to having fdic professionals join the occ in examinations of keystone related less to turf concerns than to apprehension that feathers would be ruffled at the bank is profoundly indefensible concerned that keystone posed a serious risk to the insurance fund f6ic staff decided to elevate their request to take part in the 1998 examination to the full fdic board of which the comptroller is one of five statutory members in the end they chose not to present the case to the board because after a lengthy delay the occ eventually acquiesced to limited fdic participation but what has become apparent in extensive discussions with fdic and occ staff is clear resistance on the occs part to fdic review of banks in certain difficult situations and of some timidity of fdic staff to challenge treasury department hegemony although the occ reversed its original position just one week before the june 30 1998 fdic board meeting at which this issue was to be discussed it would appear that the occs reluctance to involve the fdic in the examination and other important meetings may have contributed to a lesser fdic involvement than was warranted for example in february of 1998 the fdic asked for three examiner slots for the upcoming 1998 examination but the occ agreed in the week before the june board meeting to allow only one although the occ later agreed to permit two fdic examiners its basis for wantingto limit fdic involvement is not clear less than a year later after keystones condition had further deteriorated the occ agreed to allow seven fdic examiners to participate in the 1999 examination it was during that examination that the stunning losses were uncovered the turf battle over the number of examiners reflected the substantive disagreements the two agencies had over the banks operations the fdic in 1998 questioned the valuation of the residual assets on keystones books and the potential loss exposure of the banks subprime lending activities in particular the fdic believed that keystones valuation of its residual assets which comprised over 200 percent of keystones capital was not supported after the occ agreed to limited fdic participation in the 1998 examination the fdic contends that its examiners were to remain on site until all questions about the banks accounting and recordkeeping were answered the occ however completed the onsite portion of the examination in 15 workdays without obtaining sufficient support for the residual valuation and without completing the reconcilement of balance sheet accounts leaving fdic examiners with no resolution to this critical concern when the banks accountant finally provided the missing information to the occ at a meeting in january 1999 the fdic reports that it was neither invited nor even informed of the meetingthis despite the fact that the fdic had specifically asked to be kept fully informed as insurer and backup supervisor on issues relating to keystone similarly the occ did not invite the fdic to an april 1999 meeting with the developers of the banks residual valuation model which was a primary fdic concern because it was central to determining the risk to the bank insurance fund the bureaucratic turf battle over keystone disturbingly reveals flaws in the current system while the fdic to the maximum extent possible should coordinate examinations with other regulators it has long been the assumption of legislators that the fdic could at its discretion fully participate in examinations with other regulators or conduct special examinations of any federallyinsured institution without delay or interference whenever it identified a risk of loss to the insurance fund the keystone incident shows the fdic to be coerced not by the regulated but by its fellow regulators who have a shared accountability with the fdic to the american taxpayer the fdic has a unique role in our financial system and it must be insulated from regulatory turf battles and political considerations it is instrumental in maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking industry and is responsible for safeguarding the deposits of customers of all insured financial institutions implicitly the fdic also has a role in assuring competitive equity by safeguarding the insurance funds it keeps insurance premiums as low as possible and protects wellrun institutions from assuming liabilities associated with high flyers it would appear that the fdic in its role as guardian of the insurance funds should have taken a more aggressive stance in insisting on its authority to examine keystone in response to a letter of mine on the subject the fdic made a strong case that it should have been given a more active role in keystone examinations yet the agency did not rigorously pursue its rights and obligations in the matter for example the fdic initially agreed to the occs terms of allowing only one fdic examiner in the 1998 examination of keystone despite its judgment four months earlier that it needed three if the fdic had serious concerns about keystones threat to the fund it had a fiduciary obligation to press its case to the board that three examiners were needed and should be approved concern also exists about the length of time that elapsed between the fdics february 1998 request to participate in the keystone examination and its planned presentation of the case to the board in june while this delay allowed the agencies time to negotiate before the start of the examination the fdic should have acted on a more forceful and timely basis to resolve the disagreement while coordination among the agencies is important cooperation should not overshadow the fdics primary responsibility to protect the safety and soundness of the insurance funds in attempting to understand the interagency conflict that existed in the supervision of keystone it i instructive to review the legislative history of the fdics authority to examine national banks and other insured institutions prior to 1950 the fdic could utilize its special examination authority to examine a national bank only with the written consent of the occ this veto power over the fdic proved untenable and the house passed legislation that year which permitted the fdic to examine national banks as backup supervisor without the occs written consent in conference with the senate however the bill was modified to require the full fdic boardof which the occ is a memberto authorize any special examination requests this provision has survived to this day as section 10 b 3 of the federal deposit insurance act while more restrictive of fdic independence than the original house language the 1950 change in law ended the ability of other agencies to veto fdic participation in examinations as backup supervisor as was possible from 1935 until 1950 in 1950 the fdic board consisted of three members only the comptroller was from the treasury department the other two directors were affiliated only with the fdic in 1989 the board was changed to the current fivemember format there are now three independent members plus the heads of the occ and the ots who represent the treasury department this arrangement does not give treasury agencies majority control under normal circumstances when however there is a vacancy in one of the three fdic positions half of the four remaining board members represent agencies of the treasury department if two of the independent seats were to be vacant the treasury department would effectively control the fdic board this is not an insignificant matter considering that the current statutory language regarding fdic backup examination authority was written at a time when the majority of the fdics original threemember board reflected control by an independent agency rather than a cabinet department however when there is a vacancy on the fdic board the treasury department assumes a larger role than congress intended and the fdics backup authority can be subject to challenge from 1983 until 1993 for example the occ and the fdic operated under an agreement whereby the occ would invite fdic participation in examinations of banks with composite 4 and 5 ratings indicating a troubled bank additionally the occ would allow fdic participation in examination of higher rated banks with an emphasis on 3rated banks in september 1993 this collegial arrangement changed two of the independent seats were vacant and the fdics board then dominated by the two treasury representatives voted to end this longstanding agreement the new policy reserve to the fdic board all decisions regarding concurrent or special examinations regardless of the rating of the institution this change in policy was entered into despite an explicit written communication to the fdic by thenhouse banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez and me the thenranking member that congress had serious reservations that the proposal under consideration would have the effect of the fdic improperly derogating its authority while the occ board member seemed sympathetic at the time to the need for fdic special examinations for 4 and 5rated institutions he clearly had concerns about fdic involvement in higherrated institutions yet the fdic acting chairman and fdic staff who attended the meeting insisted that under certain circumstances it may be more important to involve the fdic as backup supervisor in examinations of deteriorating 3rated banks than in the examinations of 4 and 5rated institutions with already identified and addressed problems keystone is a case in point two years later in 1995 the fdic board delegated authority to its division of supervision to authorize participation in certain backup examination activities of institutions when the fdic is invited by the primary regulator or when the fdic asks and the primary regulator does not object in cases such as keystone however when the primary regulator objects fdic policy dictates that the case must be brought to the full fdic board regardless of the rating or conditions of the bank unfortunately the fdic board has not had its full complement of five directors since an independent director resigned over a year ago which results in treasury having influence disproportionate to congressional intent during this period of time the administration has failed to submit a nominee for this current vacancy on the fdic board the result is that proposed actions or policies supported by the two independent fdic directors can be blocked by the two directors who are affiliated with the treasury agencies the occ and the ots this is not good governance by failing to nominate a person for the unfilled board position the administration has forced the fdic to operate without clear independence from the power considerations of the qcc and ots such a situation could have been a factor in the fdics decision not to vigorously pursue in the spring of 1998 its original request in the keystone case the bottom line is that all regulators share a common responsibility to protect the safety and soundness of the unitedstates financial systema responsibility that should not be affected by turf concerns the occs principal response to date in the aftermath of the keystone failure has been to declare that all fdic requests to participate in an occ examination or conduct a special examination of a national bank will now be considered directly by the comptroller himself while this procedure is certainly better than having occ staff deny a request and forcing the fdic to ask the board for approval the response is still inadequate because it would do nothing to address the potential for undue treasury agency influence on the fdic board when a vacancy exists the treasury is in effect in control it has veto power over fdic participation this is clearly contrary to congressional intent that the fdic operate as an independent agency and that it alone be able to determine whether an examination is necessary for insurance purposes without undue influence by another federal regulator from a broader perspective i might add that since looking into the details of the keystone case i have learned that a lack of cooperation is rare but not isolated despite the generally constructive working relationship among federal bank regulators in some 90 instances of badkup examinations over the past four years there have been in addition to keystone four other cases in which the primary regulatory agency initially rejected the fdics request to participate in an examination three of these cased involved the occ and the other the ots in all four instances as with keystone the primary agency ultimately agreed to some form of fdic participation without formal board action the record of these five cases confirms that disagreements among agencies are the exception rather than the norm there are also no indications that the fdic is capriciously using its backup authority nevertheless the keystone failure makes a graphic case that the current process needs improving accordingly to reinforce fdic independence on matters affecting the insurance fund i have introduced today legislation to give the fdic chairman authority in special circumstances to direct fdic examiners to examine any insured institution instead of the current provision vesting such authority with the fdic board of directors this authority will continue to be used only when in the words of section 10 b 3 of the federal deposit insurance act an examination is necessary to determine the condition of such depository institution for insurance purposes the legislation would require that in exercising this authority all reasonable efforts be made to coordinate with any other appropriate regulator and to minimize any disruptive effect of a special examination on the operation of the depository institution the intent is not to press new fdic regulation on the banking system but simply to stress that in unusual special circumstances the fdic must be able to act as an independent rather than subordinate agency of government i believe this legislation will help assure the safety and soundness of the american financial system and protect the insurance funds by underscoring statutorily the longterm intent of congress that fdic backup authority must be of an independent nature the chairman would be required to notify other fdic board members and the federal reserve and state banking authority as applicable whenever he or she makes such a decision as the custodian of the insurance funds the fdic must be allowed to perform its role as a backup regulator on a timely basis whenever circumstances warrant it is worth noting that the inspector general ig of the fdic has come to similar conclusions in an october 19 1999 memorandum to the fdic chairman the ig recommended that the fdic board delegate its special examination authority to the fdic chairman or that the law be amended to vest that authority in the chairman the legislation i am introducing today would address the igs concerns as well as my own the ig argued that the agencys backup examination authority was particularly critical in this era of increasing bank consolidation while the megabanks created by recent mergers pose the greatest risks to the insurance funds the fdic is the primary regulator for only two of the nations 39 largest institutions obstacles to future fdic access to relevantinformation about megabank operations in its role as backup supervisor could have consequences far greater than the keystone case to assess risk in large institutions where it does not have an ongoing presence the fdic requires timely information and records on important aspects of operations therefore the bill i am introducing also includes language emphasizing the right of the fdic to prompt access to information from other regulators and requiring the federal banking agencies to establish procedures for sharing other information in addition to examination reports whenever such information is relevant to the fdics responsibility to protect the insurance funds this provision of the bill underscores the importance of interagency coordination and information sharing to ensure that the fdic has the necessary data to assess risk to the insurance funds it is intended to have the practical benefit of potentially minimizing the number of occasions in which the fdic must exercise its special examination authority the vast majority of institutions will not be affected in any way by this legislation for most institutions the fdic does not need any special information other than that already available to it nor does it need to perform any form of backup examination but clearly in cases where the potential risk to the fund is greatbanks with significant weaknesses especially if they are megabanks with exceedingly complex activitiesthe fdic should be able to function as congress expects it to function and receive from the primary regulator the information it needs to assess relevant risk i might add before closing that my concerns in the keystone case extend beyond the issues of regulatory cooperation and fdic special examination authority there are also troubling questions here about the regulators ability to identify and stem high risk bank activities in a timely fashion there was another bank failure involving extremely high losses relative to assets just over a year ago on july 23 1998 colorado state banking authorities closed bestbankan fdicsupervised state bank located in boulderafter state and fdic examiners found 134 million in losses in highrisk unsecured subprime credit card accounts although the fdic initially estimated the cost of that failure to the insurance fund at about 28 million by years end the estimate had risen 6fold to 171 6 million i mention the bestbank case because of its striking similarities to the keystone case like the junkbond investments of s ls in the 1980s both bestbank and keystone were disproportionately involved in highrisk activities namely subprime loans both banks relied heavily on outside third party servicers both banks had experienced extraordinarily high asset growth both banks had high public profiles in the mid1990s bestbank was labeled in one banking publication as the best performer among unitedstates banks and keystone captured the title of the nations most profitable community bank for three straight years keystone and bestbank also engaged in similar tactics to frustrate federal examiners and fraud is alleged to have played a part in the failure of both unfortunately i suspect we may also find some parallels in how federal regulators handled the two cases the fdic ig in conducting the material loss review in the bestbank case concluded that the fdic could have been more effective in controlling the banks rapid asset growth and thus curbing losses to the insurance fund while we do not yet know the final outcome of the investigations into either of these recent bank failures it is clear that the banking agencies need to continue to review their supervisory strategies for banks engaging in inherently risky activities such as subprime lending accordingly i am asking each of the federal banking regulators to keep the committee informed of any new policies and procedures for identifying institutions with profiles similar to those of keystone and bestbank and any changes in their supervisory practices with respect to such institutions also i am interested in any initiatives that would assist examinersin the detection of fraud which is becoming a factor in an increasing percentage of failures in this regard i am pleased to note that fdic chairman donna tanoue recently announced that the fdic is developing guidelines to require additional capital for subprime portfolios and reviewing potential increases in insurance premiums for banks that continue to engage in high risk activities of this nature without appropriate safeguards in closing the insurance fund should not have to suffer an excessive loss during this era of generally favorable economic conditions expensive failures impose unfair costs in the form of higher insurance premiums on honest law abiding community banks around the country failures also impose costs on depositors whose accounts exceed insurance limits and as illustrated by the keystone case failure can take a heavy toll on the local community and those whose jobs depend on the survival of the bank clearly it is critical that federal regulators cooperate with each other and pay particular attention to unusually rapid asset growth and potentially risky banking practices if future keystonesand bestbanks are to be averted"],

gentleman from michigan has pointed out there are a lot of provisions in here that are extremely important to the customs service h r 1833 provides additional resources needed for the unitedstates customs service to combat illegal drug activities across our border it will provide additional equipment with the latest technology for the antidrug enforcement provisions it provides additional funds for the child cybersmuggling center to assist in our efforts to prevent child pornography so there is a lot of good in this bill we are going to support it i think it is going to get a large vote but there is bad in this bill there are provisions that should not be in here it amends existing laws concerning the payment of nightshift pay for our customs officers let me talk a little bit about what this congress did before why we put shift pay differential in the law congress found that these odd hour shifts that customs officials are assigned they do not volunteer are assigned as part of their work have an adverse impact on the quality of life of customs officials who are required to work regularly scheduled shifts at night on sundays or holidays we found as a body that the shift differential compensation levels are substantially greater than applied generally to other federal employees for such regularly scheduled work so what this legislation is doing is altering the balance that we took in 1993 and that is just wrong unitedstates customs service performs vital functions of both law enforcement and preserving the integrity of unitedstates trade laws with foreign nations the current compensation structure was designed to take account of the unusual stresses of their job both onjob safety risks and irregular work hours we should honor that and i agree with the gentleman from michigan the process should provide us an opportunity as a body to express our will on the subject but the process that has been used by the majority will deny that opportunity today yes we will support the bill because of the important provisions in it but the provision concerning pay differential is wrong it should be removed from the bill this bill alters the balanced approached crafted in 1993 in two ways first the provision restricts the hours that qualify for the night shift differential to hours between 6 and 6 a second the provision comipensates customs officers at the differential rate only for those hours that occur between 6 and 6 with one limited exception and not the entire shirt effectively these changes will mean that a customs officer who works a shift starting at 3 and ending at 11 will receive the shift differential for only 3 hours of that shift to offset some of the loss in pay likely to occur section 121 of the bill adjusts the overtime cap that under current law restricts the amount of overtime pay a customs officer may earn in one year in effect this adjustment would allow customs officers to work more overtime to compensate for lost wages or put another way customs officers will have to work more to get the same pay such a result seems unfair given that no one including customs has alleged that customs officers are overcompensated moreover only a small percentage of officers currently reach the overtime cap and therefore would even benefit from the new provision a single report done in 1996 by the office of inspector general oig has been offered to support this change to night shift differential pay that report purportedly reviews the operation of the night pay differential and the overtime cap since copra the report which concludes that the copra resulted in an increase in overall premium night shift differential payments is however seriously flawed first the oig report merely calculated the absolute increase in night differential pay over a three year period the report did not investigate the cause of the increase the oigs report did not investigate whether the increase was due to an overall increase in the number of hours being worked whether there was an increase in the number of late shifts being worked due to increased trade or whether the increase in cost was attributable to an increase in base wages rather the oig report merely concludes that the increase was due to copra without investigating entertaining or otherwise considering any other possible reasons for the increase second the oig report did not assess the impact on customs employees salaries as discussed above the 1993 changes to the methods of calculating premium night shift differential payments was part of a comprehensive package of reforms intended to ensure that customs officers would receive pay adequate compensation for the hard and often dangerous work they perform altering the carefully crafted package congress created in 1993 without assessing the impact on customs officers overall pay is irresponsible and could result in an unwarranted pay cut for many of these officers such a result seems unfair given that no one including oig and customs has alleged that customs employees are overpaid third oig did not find any evidence of abuse in this system in fact to the contrary the oig report specifically states that customs management did not change work schedules to allow employees to earn more shift differential pay rather customs management continued to schedule shifts to fit customers demand we are not opposed to considering amendments to customs officers pay if a credible study evaluates and recommends that legislative changes be made however we are opposed to cutting someones wages based on report that shows nothing the men and women of the unitedstates customs service perform vital functions with respect to both law enforcement keeping drugs and other contraband from crossing our bordersand preserving the integrity of unitedstates trade with foreign nations their current compensation structure was designed to take account of the unusual stresses of their j0bboth the onthejob safety risks and the irregular hours we do not believe that there is clear evidence that those aspects of a customs officers job have changed in a way that would justify reducing their pay which is precisely what h r 1833 will do its too bad we have a good bill here we found a flaw and i believe there would have been a way to address this issue that would have made

they should be commended for their work in bringing this bill forward i will support this bill but grudgingly because i believe the reductions it makes in foreign aid are too deep and i believe we should be asking other parts of the federal budget to share the burden we are placing on this bill but instead we are increasing spending in other areas and asking foreign aid to pick up the slack we are asking this budget to bend further and further and im here to say this budget cant bend any further as a fiscal conservative and a senior member of the budget committee my number one priority in

airports nearby have to live with this oppressive aircraft noise it has an extremely negative impact on the quality of their lives and on their health in an attempt to address this problem the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 was enacted this law requires jet aircraft to be equipped with newer technology quieter stage 3 engines by december 31 1999 it ends the operation of the older noisier stage 2 and stage 1 aircraft engines as a result of that law major commercial airliners have already phased out most of their stage 2 and stage 1 aircraft but unfortunately the law exempted aircraft weighing less than 75 000 pounds planes weighing less than 75 000 pounds are typically general aviation aircraft however even though these general aviation aircraft are smaller than commercial airliners in most cases they are louder than commercial airliners because most of them are still equipped with the stage 2 or stage 1 engines therefore air noise problems in our most densely populated areas in the united states will not go away unless we have an acrosstheboard elimination of stage 2 and stage 1 aircraft engines including engines of all general aviation aircraft let me give you an example at teterboro airport in new jersey in my district teterboro airport has roughly 15 percent of the aircraft using teterboro with the stage 1 or stage 2 aircraft only 15 percent but that 15 percent of stage 1 and stage 2 aircraft account for 90 percent 90 percent of all the aircraft noise violations at the airport so the solution i am introducing the aircraft noise reduction act of 1999

bring civilityand trying to cut down the crime rate in our society we all know that for many many many years in this country we have suffered unfairly at the hands of terrorism it has happened right here in these house chambers right here where my colleagues are sitting take a look right up there look up there on the roof do my colleagues know what is up there on the roof of the unitedstates house of representatives chambers there is a bullet hole right up there my colleagues can see it right here i will show my colleagues something else look i am not tearing up the desks in here but i want to show mycolleagues something this is drawer do my colleagues know what is right there it is a bullet hole that is a bullet hole a bullet shot in the house chambers theoretically this should be one of the safest places in the country this is the peoples house that is a bullet hole now how did that bullet hole get there puerto rican terrorists in march 1954 puerto rican terrorists they were there right there in the galleries and they opened fire they wounded at least five congressmen they wounded a number of other people but more than that they broke that cloak of security that we thought we had in the peoples house in washington d c we have to have consequences for those puerto rican terrorists that did that we have to have consequences for the next generation that followed in that terrorism group well what happened in the last couple of weeks our president president of the united states granted clemency for a number of puerto rican terrorists what do i mean by clemency it is kind of a fancy word he let them go he absolved them of their sins it is kind of like going to confession except they did not really have to confess all they had to say is take me on my word i am a person that should be trusted i will not do it again they were let free there will be a price to pay for letting terrorists walk free tonight let us talk a little bit about that organization what is that organization we are going to call it the faln faln what does it stand for it is the acronym for armed services of national liberation that is the only time i am going to say that tonight because i am going to use the initials faln the easiest way we remember it as we go through our comments is that it is a puerto rican separatist group now they really came to light here in 1954 here as i said i showed my colleagues the bullet hole right here i showed them the bullet hole in the roof of the unitedstates capitol of the house chambers well they struck again they struck again january 24 1975 by attacking another icon of american history new york city as a result of their terrorist act the 1975 bombing of the tavern in new york city where general george washington bid farewell to his troops in 1738 and left four dead as a result of this they quickly became the most feared domestic terrorist group in the united states the most feared group in the united states this is the same group that in the last week the president of this country let them go he gave them clemency he said okay you have been absolved you are free to go i have got a lot of comments about that a lot of comments from the law enforcement community my colleagues know how politicians sometimes say look i like to listen i listen before i make my decisions so logically if i have something dealing for example with prescription drugs we talk to seniors who are having problems with prescription drugs we talk to the pharmaceutical companies who are having troubles getting approval by the fda we talk to the fda we talk to the different parties how many law enforcement agencies were ever visited by the administration before they let these terrorists walk do my colleagues know what the answer is zero i am going to give my colleagues some statistics here in just a few minutes statistics i think will stun them as to how this decision was made and why this decision was made clearly a decision of that kind of significance is not made without some reason without some kind of purpose there is something behind the decision of that kind of significance we are going to explore that here in just a few minutes but let us talk a little bit more about the faln by the way i give credit to the usa today they did an excellent article last week on tuesday september 21 if my colleagues have a copy of the usa today take a look at it excellent article on this very issue in their heyday the faln members bombed public and commercial buildings bombed public and commercial buildings do my colleagues know the fear that went through this country just a couple of years ago with mcveigh in oklahoma city or the unibomber gosh i hope not 20 years from now that some other president steps up there and says we ought to pardon this fellow that bombed oklahoma city or we ought to pardon the unibomber out here you know 20 years is a long time to serve for a bombing there were people killed for these bombings there was fear put in the hearts of everybody in this country just like all of us now have fear about truck bombs my colleagues know what it was like when a moving van drove up by ones house 1 or 2 weeks after oklahoma city it instilled fear in us it is a fear that we should not have to live with in this country the only way the only way that we will move from that fear is to have consequences for the actions that drive that fear let me go back they robbed banks this is the faln this is the organization of which the administration released absolved gave clemency to last week this group in their heyday they bombed they robbed banks they held up armored cars and stole dynamite from a mining company in colorado that is my home state they took weapons from the national guard armory in wisconsin let me quote wayman mullins he is the author of a source book here is his book mr mullins book a source book the sources he has done a lot of research a source book on domestic and international terrorism he says this organization of which these many of these members were released last week they were dangerous dedicated and committed dangerous dedicated and committed as a former cop let me say that that is a very lethal combination a very lethal combination the faln was a group that got involved in a lot of things i think we should have some examples i am standing up here talking about bombings and armed car robberies and talking about other acts of terrorism in major cities new york city which put fear in the hearts of people throughout the country let me give my colleagues some specific examples so they will know exactly what these people who were released from prison last week because the president let them go we all should have an idea of what they did of what they were involved in among the faln actions october 26 1974 five bombings five bombings in downtown new york city more than 1 million in damage that was in 1974 december 11 1974 new york police were called to an upper east side building to collect a dead body the building was booby trapped a police officer was injured and lost an eye january 24 again the faln january 24 1975 fraunces tavern bombed four killed 54 injured more than 300 000 in damage june 15 1975 two bombs detonated in the chicago loop area february 1977 merchandise mart in chicago bombed millions in damages august 3 1977 mobile oil employment office in new york bombed one killed several injured november 1979 two chicago military recruiting offices and an armory bombed march 1980 faln members seized at the cartermondale campaign office in chicago and the george bush campaign office in chicago destroying property and spray painting separatist slogans on all the walls december 31 1982 four bombs detonated in new york outside police and federal buildings does this sound like a replay of oklahoma city maybe oklahoma city was modeled after some of what these people had done let me repeat that f our bombs detonated in new york outside police and federal buildings and remember this is the same group that called in a report of a dead body and boobytrapped the building so that these police officers and we all know cops we all have some in our families some that are our friends to walk in this building and hopefully be hurt that is exactly what the intent was of the faln now they had a leader their leader was morales williammorales morales escaped from a hospital in new york and fled to mexico guess what he did in mexico well he killed a cop shot a police officer guess what mr morales is now doing mr morales went to cuba whatishe doinghe just heard the news the news has gone to cuba that the president ofthe united states hasissued a pardon tothe terrorists of the faln so what has mr morales now done he has applied for a pardon he has now asked for clemency from the president of the united states if anyone were to have asked me a few weeks ago what the chances were of any of these peoplebeing granted clemency i would have said none zero zip that is not goingto happen now i do not know maybe this guy in cuba is going to get to walkaway from kill ing the cop from leading this organization it is disturbing it is really disturbing let us talk about a few of the people that have just walked edwin cortes born1955 sentenced in october 1985 14 years ago 35 years for conspiracy including the bombing of military training centers released by order of the administration elizam escobar born 1948 sentenced in february 1981 18 years ago to 60 years for firearms violations released by order of the administration ricardo jimenez born 1956 sentenced in february 1981 to 90 years to 90 years he served 19 ordered released under the clemency by the president last week robert maldonadorivera born 1936 sentenced in june 1989 to 5 years for his role in the 1983 heist of 7 1 million released in 1994 but the clemency that he got forgave his 100 000 dollar fine they not only let these people out of jail but if they owed a fine which they had not paid for the damage they had done the millions in bombings and the money they had stolen from armored cars and so on they do not even have to pay the money back any more take a regular citizen in our country who owes money to a bank in default i wonder if they get to walk away from that no they do not get to walk away from it but if an individual happens to be a terrorist with the faln then they can get this clemency let us go on and i will pick a couple more here juansegarrapalmer born 1950 sentenced in october 1985 14 years ago 55 years in prison and a 500 000 fine forconspiracy for bank robbery for interstate transportation of stolen money in connection with the 1983 armored car heist he will serve 5 more years and he gets out of the mediumsecurity prison norman ramireztalavera born 1957 sentenced in june 1989 for 5 years for a 1983 armored car heist he was released in 1994 but the clemency just worked out forgave a 50 000 fine well we will not go through all of them let me piok one or two others i luis rosa born 1960 sentenced in february 1981 to 75 years for conspiracy andfirearms violations carmen valentin born 1946 sen tenced in february 1981 to 90 years for conspiracy and firearmsviolations so i think we all get an idea of what we are dealing with we have a good ideaof what these people are they arenot our neighbor next door they are notregular joe or regular jane down the street these are bad people andthey id bad things and they hurt a lot ofpeople i do not know if any of my colleagues have beenwatching tv in the last couple of weeks but maybe they haveseen the widow or some of the surviving family members of those people bombed in new york city it reminded me of oklahoma city and i cannot for the life of me understand how a president can pardon those people we should make them pay the rice what rind of message are we sending out there what kind of message do we send to our young people what kind of message do we send to the rest of the world now some of my colleagues may ask why i am bringing up all these points that it seems so onesided that there must be some logical thinking behind this the president must have had a profound reason why he would take such a dramatic step to release these hardened criminals well before they were supposed to be released there must be some reasoning to it well i think before we go to what i think the reasoning is we ought to talk a little more about these convicts one of the things that the president quickly said after he found out he had created a firestorm in this country after he found out some people were going to say we want accountability mr president it is true that the president has the right to grant clemency that is under the constitution we are not contesting this right but the president owes it to the american people to explain to the american people why he is letting these puerto rican terrorists go well the answer came back because they have held up their hand and promised that they will not commit any more violence that they have re nounced violence as a part of their life it is amazing i used to be a cop it is amazing how many convicts and how many people we arrest that all of a sudden will find a new life all of a sudden they would promise me look i am not going to do it any more i have changed my ways i have changed my life really to determine whether that personis sincere or not wehave to do some research it is like anything else what are the facts what is the re search we have to look into the per sons background well it has happened on a couple of these people they tape recorded these convicts conversations in jail and what was interesting was that these convicts knew they knew their conversations were being taped so this was not anything secret they were not secretly disclosing their thoughts about violence they knew they were being tape recorded and they could havecared less theywanted people to know and i will give an example jailhouse statements of some of the faln members in october 1995 for example luis rosa alicia rodriguez and carlos torres told the chicago tribune they have nothing to be sorry forand they have no intention of ever renouncing an armed revolution another faln member granted clemency ricardo jimenez told the judge in his case we are going to fight we are going to fight revolu tionary justice will take care of you and everybody else now does that sound aike the average ease that a president should let out of jail well what does the fbi think about all of this what are their thoughts well first of all guess what has happened we in the united states congress think as i stated earlier that the people deserve an explanation of why the president and the administra tion took this action we do not doubt that the president has the authority as 1 mentioned earlier under the constitution to do this but he owes an explanation to the american people but guess what the white house all of a sudden grabs a paper and says executive privilege it is executive privilege executive privilege used to be used by the presidents when we had a secret we were afraid our foreign enemies would find out about like a military secret or a secret military mission or something with the central intelligence agency that the president to protect those secrets would say executive privilege what secret is to be protected here of a national threat none but there may be some political intent that ought to be protected but that is what the president has done they have said executive privilege they do not want there to be testimony to these federal agencies the president does not want them to go to the united states congress who are elected by the people of this country and to testify about this well the fbi was able to speak a top fbi official and i am quoting from the associated press of september 22 that is today this is hot off the wire this happened yesterday on the hill so let me read a couple of things federal bureau of investigation a top fbi official told congress he regards he regards and remember he is at the very top echelon of the fbi he regards puerto rican militants freed in a grant of clemency by president clinton as terrorists who continue to represent a threat to the united states of america here is the agency that we charge with law enforcement the agency that we charge with the priority investigation of terrorist acts and what do they say to the president well what they say i wish they could have had the opportunity to say before he released them i wish the president would have called them and asked them but he did not they say one of the top officials says they continue to represent a threat to the united states of america the article goes on gallagher that is the gentlemans name fbi gallaghers testimony marked the first time that federal law enforcement officials have testified on the issue also on hand were officials from the justice department and the bureau of prisons they were barred they were stopped they were barred from answering questions about clemency because of the white house executive privilege do i think they should be out on the street i think these are criminals and that they are terrorists and that they represent a threat to the united states says gallagher the top fbi officer let me repeat that do i think they should be out on the street that is the question i think these are criminals and they are terrorists and that they represent a threat to the united states how much clearer can that information be as my colleagues know we have to rely and we have had some problems we will talk about waco and some other issues we have had some problems with our law enforcement agencies but we have got a lot of good cops out there and we ought to rely on them and it is not just the fbi that said do not do it there are a lot of law enforcement agencies out there that said mr president do not do this these people remain a threat to our society they remain a direct threat to the united states of america listen to us that is what happened signed the paper let me go further the fbi was one of several law enforcement organizations opposed to the clemency asked about the continuing threat of the faln and its sister group in puerto rico gallagher ticked off a handful of more recent bombings in chicago and puerto rico believed to have been conducted by these very organizations clintons offer of clemency has come under fire from some who have accused him of making it to boost first lady hillary rodham clintons popularity amongst new yorks 1 3 million puerto ricans mrs clinton is considering a bid for the senate from new york in oh finally finally we are beginning to look at maybe there is some kind of reason some kind of profound thought behind such a ludicrous decision to let these terrorists back out on the street you know what i think the average puerto rican in new york and i am not puerto rican i am not from new york but you know what i think the average hardworking puerto rican in new york thinks about this they probably agree now i may get some calls tonight from some angry people who do not agree with me i expect that that is part of my job but i think there are a lot of american citizens out there regardless of whether they are puerto rican whether they are irish or scottish or african american or hispanic and there are a lot of ordinary americans out there that do not think this is right they think if you are a criminal if you are a terrorist you ought to be in jail and once we get you in jail you ought to stay in jail at least serve out the sentences that our justice system gave to you that is what i think the average american out there thinks regardless of their ethnic background we are americans we all want a country with low crime we do not want to have fear every time a truck pulls up that there is a bomb in the back of it we want to be able to go into a federal building we like to go into the house of representatives without seeing a bullet hole in the roof without seeing a bullet in the drawer we all think a lot alike do not dare try and separate us based on ethnic background do not dare try and say because we are hispanic american or puerto rican american or irish american or african american but for some reason just because of ethnic background we think these terrorists ought to walk that drive by the administration is wrong you are going down the wrong path let me talk a little more about why and quote the wall street journal friday august 13 same subject to understand remember earlier in the speech i talked about statistics you know do not just take scott mcinnis word for it let us take a look at what the statistics say about how many you know about the clemency how many times for example a logical question how many times has the president during his tenure been asked to grant clemency for prisoners and once we know how many times he has been asked how many times of that how many of those did he actually grant you know we measure a lot of times we measure a good governor you know on how many pardons they give i mean you measure people we have to have a tool of measurement well we have been kind of blessed in this case we have got the tools of measurement we have a darn good measurement out there to understand how rare it is this is the wall street journal how rare it is for a president to commute a sentence or offer remission of a fine as mr clinton did for 16 puerto rican terrorists this week consider the numbers supplied by the office of the pardoned attorney from the time he took office in january 1993 until april 2 of this year the most recent report from the pardon office mr clinton received the request for 3 042 petitions he received 3 042 petitions for clemency until wednesday out of that 3 042 he granted three three of those out of 3 042 in the 7 years or so that he has been in office now the wall street journal and i quote again from the wall street journal september 8 1999 and get a hold of this this almost makes me my gut wrench listen to this the puerto ricans had not even submitted a clemency request did not even submit a request and they got to be no 4 out of 3 042 now what fell out of the blue sky for this president all of a sudden to be interested in 16 puerto rican terrorists who had committed bombing crimes i remember very wetl the language in the speech that the president made in oklahoma city it was a very compassionate speech it was a good speech he cared every american cared about the tragedy that occurred in oklahoma city and i remember the president talking to us in his state of the union addresses about terrorism and the need to stop it we must not tolerate terrorism coming from that president what happened what fell out of the sky well i tell you what it points to it points to a united states senate race in the state of new york he has a lot of interest in that race up there i read to you earlier associated press hillary clinton 1 3 or 1 4 puerto ricans in new york state what is going on here are politics so driven in this country is the winning of elective office so demanding in this country and so important in this country that we are willing to put at risk american lives by releasing these 16 terrorists somebody ought to answer that question and you know somebody has answered that question i want to read you their answer before i read you this answer let me read one other thing that i think is important for us to consider out of the wall street journal friday august 13 mrs clinton of course hopes one day to take her place in the parade alongside new yorks other pols which we would say explains in a nutshell why her husband has just granted clemency to these 16 puerto rican terrorists against the advice of the justice department the fbi and the unitedstates attorneys office that prosecuted the terrorists back in the early 1980s all of these law enforcement agencies were consulted several years about the wisdom of releasing these 16 people all advised against it well let me wrap it up with a letter i am going to read the letter verbatim it is a couple pages long i know that it requires some patience for you to listen to this i mean i have been speaking for a while here but it is important because i think it really addresses from the heart somebody who has experience in the atrocities that these terrorists have committed somebody who understands that terrorism must have consequences that the people that commit that misbehave in our society must be punished and there must be punishment that means something you cannot just slap them on the hand after they rob the bank and serve a few years and let them go especially considering there were only 3 042 requests and only three got granted well let us read that letter who is it from it is from the new york city police commissioner howard safir and as i said i am reading the letter verbatim with last fridays release of 11 of the 14 faln terrorists president clinton has committed an illadvised and egregious error he has broken the fundamental rule in addressing terrorism he has broken the fundamental rule in addressing terrorism never negotiate deals with terrorists never negotiate deals with terrorists now obviously when i repeat a sentence that is mine it is not repeated in the letter mr clinton has sent the message that the lives of american citizens and of the heroic police officers who defend them are disposable as the police commissioner of new york city i represent 40 200 officers and take the responsibility for the safety of 7 4 million residents i have become all too familiar with the violence that has been perpetrated by the members of the puerto rican separatist group known as the faln and the manner in which my city and my officers have suffered at the their hands during a 9year reign of terror the faln was responsible for at least 150 bombings that killed six people and injured more than 70 the brunt of their viciousness the brunt of their viciousness was aimed at the people of new york city who endured more than 70 attacks and accounted for four of the deaths and 57 of the injuries what others have termed a war of liberation new yorkers know that to be a war against the innocent the targets of this organization included restaurants at lunch time hotels banks and department stores while the passage of time may have faded the memory of some i cannot share that perspective i have seen the devastating consequences of these destructive acts i have spoken with several victims of the attacks and their families people like joseph connor whose father frank t connor was killed in the bombing in the fraunces tavern i know too well the permanent scars that are carried the permanent scars that are carried by detectives rocco pascarella richard pastorella and anthony semft during a wave of terror that saw the faln detonate four separate explosive devices across the city in the course of a single hour these men suffered horrific injuries defending new york city from these terrorists cost these heroes cost these heroes their hands and legs and left them permanently blinded and painfully maimed no one can commute the life sentences no one can commute the life sentences that the faln imposed upon its victims some argue that the felons to whom mr clinton offered clemency are not personally responsible for their organizations violence i cannot agree the crimes for which these men and women were convicted included robbery the plotting of bombs and the possession of dangerous weapons one of the petitioners possessed a loaded firearm and more than 10 pounds of dynamite in a january 1998 letter ronnie l iedelman a deputy bureau chief from the department of justice acknowledged that several of the petitioners offered clemency were arrested in 1980 for their involvement in 28 bombings and in a recent letter to this newspaper former assistant unitedstates attorney deborah devaney recounted her experiences with the petitioners a former federal prosecutor in chicago who spent years bringing criminal cases against the faln terrorists ms devaney describes capturing several of the petitioners in a van loaded with weapons and videotaping several others making bombs that they planed to use at military installations i must question the unusual progression of events that surround this clemency offer mr clintons offer to the faln members represents only his fourth clemency grant out of more than 3 000 applications filed since 1993 it was extended before any of the 16 agreed to renounce violence the president made his offer over the objections of the federal bureau of investigation the bureau of prisons and the unitedstates attorneys in illinois and connecticut the states where the 16 were convicted in my 26 years as a justice department official i never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the president over the strenuous objections of these agencies let me repeat that in my 26 years as a justice department official i never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the president over the strenuous objections of these agencies the white house has tried to defend the presidents decision in part as a response to the urgings of church leaders in particular the white house has invoked the name of cardinal john oconnor as a staunch suppor ter for the petitioners release this is all the more perplexing given that in letters and through his top aides the cardinal has said he never backed clemency for these terrorists mr clinton erred grievously in failing to follow the recommendations of his own federal agencies the house of representatives the 17 500 members of the international association of chiefs of police the 295 000 members of the fraternal order of police and countless others who voiced their outrage at this decision the united states must make clear that it will never again make deals with terrorists that was a letter read verbatim from the new york city police commissioner howard safir the question that needs to be answered of which the white house has claimed executive privilege is why these terrorists why three out of 3 042 petitions being granted and now we go to the fourth and why new york state mr president if it does not have anything to do with that unitedstates senate race in new york state you ought to waive your executive privilege although i do not think it exists under these particular circumstances but regardless of that argument you ought to waive it and you ought to answer the american people you ought to go to the american people you do not hesitate one minute to have a press conference when you are touring foreign countries whenever you have something to say you go right to the microphone you are a good speaker you are not afraid to address the american people certainly you have addressed them on a number of controversial issues you ought to address them on this one you ought to explain because what we see on paper what we saw walk out of that prison cell what we now see on the streets of america what we fear in the hearts of every american is terrorism that exists today and you have not answered it and you ought to answer it i ask for a time check"], [0.00013265013694763184, 0.49986734986305237, 1, "this bill is a bad deal for africans and americans it extends nafta what can we expect if h r 434 nafta for africa passes

to the rich and that few regular folks would ever benefit from its elimi nation i would like to bring to the attention of the house an article that appeared in the denver post this weekend entitled death taxes end ranchers dream the article describes the plight of the laurence family who have for the last couple of generations been eking out a living from an 1 800 acre ranch in the rocky mountains of colorado merrill laurence died 4 years ago and the family has been struggling ever since to keep the tax man at bay they have run out of time and resources soon the auctioneers gavel will fall and the ranch will be sold to developers november 11 will be the date that ends a 180year history of the laurence family ranching heritage this family will be moved off the land and homes will be built where the ranch now stands but the proceeds from the sale will not accrue to the heirs they do not want the sale they will not receive very much at all of what comes from that sale the money raised by this forced sale will go to satisfy the demands of the irs i can assure my friends on the other side of the aisle that there are real people out there who are affected by the death tax and who are far from fat cats that phrase that we so often hear them employ when attempting to foster class hatred in this country these people and hundreds of thousands millions others like them all over the united states are regular hardworking taxpaying families who in fact have made only a couple of mistakes in their lifetime like mr laurence many of them work too hard accumulated too much according to again people on the other side of the aisle who keep talking about the death tax as something that so few people would get and so few people deserve the elimination of the death tax the fact is that there are lots of people who actually are as i say hard working and they are not the top 1 percent as we have often been told of this nations incomeearners who would benefit by the elimination of this death tax they are people like mr laurence who as i say he made a few mistakes he worked too hard he died before a new president could take office i hope that we will soon be able to reintroduce this idea the elimination of the death tax and we will soon pass it again this will be the third time and it will be signed by the next president of the united states because it is a tax that needs to be eliminated it is an unfair unjust tax that people like the laurences of colorado are now being forced to pay and as a result being forced to sell their own heritage"]]}
