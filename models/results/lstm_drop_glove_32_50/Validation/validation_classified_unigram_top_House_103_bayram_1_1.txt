act to develop coordinated responses to fishery problems coastal states have established interstate fishery commissions under current law a state may choose to implement a commission approved

the secretary of commerce would be required to impose a fishing moratorium on that state the moratorium would prohibit fishing for the species covered by the plan within the waters of the noncomplying

it right this time in the housing bill that we passed actually not last year but 2 years ago we meant to give the states flexibility so that people who lived in assisted housing and who were otherwise eligible for low income heating assistance could get it the problem has been that the law was being interpreted to say that if one was in public housing or assisted housing they could not get any home heating assistance even if they had to pay part of their heating bill now where the individual tenant pays none of the heating bill it seemed unnecessary for them to get this assistance we wrote legislation which was intended to give flexibility but in the drafting process i made a mistake and we wound up with too much rigidity fortunately that was called to our attention by some people in fact some of the legal services group on whom i rely for information and whom i ask from time to time for an evaluation pointed this out as have some others we now have a situation where if we do not move quickly and change this not only will the states be able to give home heating assistance to these who need it it will be mandated to some people who do not need it that is some people who in fact get all of their heating bills paid for as part of their public assistance will get a windfall that windfall will come out of a limited pot that cost other people money i should note by the way that this will cost the federal government nothing this bill because it merely deals with how we allocate funds already appropriated does not add one cent to the appropriation it simply provides for a fairer way to distributing money already appropriated or the year what this bill does is what we should have done in the first place it gives the states the flexibility and what it saysis that a state may give partial heating assistance to people who pay part of their bills or whatever is appropriate the home heating issue is an important one it has not gotten in my judgment appropriate funds it is very important that we do it in the right way so this is a piece of legislation which corrects a mistake and provides as it says state flexibility and it is flexibility which is geared to need i

consider major alternatives on this issue and second because the taxpayers of this country are fed up with rhetoric and political games they want us to debate and vote on lineitem veto legislation so that we members go on record on this issue much more importantly they want us to pass legislation into law which encourages the elimination of wasteful spending this bill that we are discussing today h r 1578 began in the 103d congress with h r 1013 legislation which i had originally introduced with a bipartisan group of 80 of my colleagues the text of h i 1578 made in order by the rule maintains the basic principle of the bill i introduced earlier this yearthe requirement that congress must vote up or down on presidential rescission messages under an expedited procedure this new text reflects improvements made after extensive consultation and review to address concerns raised by members on both sides of the aisle in my opinion any fiscal conservative who claims that this bill is weaker than h r 1013 or last years h r 2164 either has not taken the time to study the changes or else has other reasons for intentionally misinterpreting the bill i defy anyone who marches under the banner of fiscal responsibility to tell me how eliminating the limitation on the amount of authorized funds makes the bill weaker or please explain to me how removing the opportunity to strike rescissions from the package is bad or perhaps you could provide insight on the damage dihe by putting in place the roadmap for a second rescission package if the presidents proposal is defeated we can argue about the merits both substantive and politicalof this approach as opposed to full lineitem veto but for those people who have enthusiastically supported enhanced rescission in the past and now bad mouth this version which is even stronger i have waning patience and waxing frustration in addition to the modified lineitem veto approach embodied in h r 1578 attention has focused on two other lineitem veto proposals in the 103d congress the duncan and solomon bills h r 159 and h r 24 that would effectively require a twothirds vote to block presidential rescissions and the michel bill h r 493 which would allow the president to rescind tax items as well as appropriations items with a twothirds vote necessary to override the president under the rule the house will have the opportunity to debate and vote on both of these approaches although i personally do not support the castlesolomon lineitem veto amendment i know that many members do and therefore i believe very strongly that the house should have the opportunity to debate and vote on this amendment as well as the michel tax amendment i have consistently and adamantly advocated this position before the rules committee and with the leadership and i am pleased with the rules committee for having granted a rule which will allow honest votes on the leading alternatives on this subject i understand it has been suggested that in private i have argued in favor of a closed rule that quite simply is not true and frankly i take offense with the suggestion that behind closed doors i might act contrary to my publo position which always has been to argue for upordown votes on major substantive issues the issue of lineitem veto authority has been debated for many many years the issues of balance of power constitutionality procedures for rescissions et cetera have long been in the marketplace of ideas and debate on the other hand only very recently have the ideas of tax expenditures and contract authority been added to this debate i believe that these two issues tax expenditures and contract authority very rightfully belong in the rescission debate i am very ekger to explore these concepts personally i want to hear others with greater constitutional and institutional expertise than i debate the nuances of including tax expenditures and contract authority in rescission authority i am considering introducing legislation embodying these two concepts in an effort to help further this discussion i think it is highly likely that 2 years from now when we consider renewing the contract on this legislation i will be prepared to vote for revisions of this sort at this point however i do not believe the debate has matured to the point where we should be attaching these unexplored ideas to legislation which is likely to be signed into law during the last congress there were several unsuccessful efforts on procedural votes to bring the lineitem veto to a vote i supported these efforts on a few occasions as did many of my friends on the other side of the aisle today we have the very opportunity that we were seeking through our procedural gymnastics that being to vote up or down on the substance of the

stomp into the dirt that very opportunity when it is handed to them today make no mistake if this rule is defeated it is very unlikely that there will be another opportunity to vote on any version of

submitting their letters of endorsement for the rscord the national taxpayers union has specifically addressed the issue of supporting the rule which it encourages because the rule provides the opportunity for a clean vote on the issue of lineitem veto ntu points out that the only effective lineitem veto will be the one that is enacted into law like ntu which simply states a vote against the rule is a vote against consideration of the lineitem veto i do not understand how it can be argued that defeating this rule and preventing any lineitem veto legislation from coming to the floor would be in the interest of american taxpayers the vote on the rule comes down to this simple point i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give the american people a reason to feel good about

unreimbursed costs for participating in and supporting u n peacekeeping operations for the failed peacekeeping operation in somalia for example congress had to approve a reprogramming and a supplemental appropriation totaling over 1 billion to cover dods unreimbursed costs similarly dod is now racking up large unreimbursed costs for its oper ations in over and around bosnia in support of

will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity

strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new

indefinitely and unconditionally next year the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons signed at washington dc london and moscow on july 1 1968 is the centerpiece of global efforts to

declared that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the highest priorities of his administration in apnl 1995 the signers of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons will convene a review conference in new york city to discuss the indefinite extension of the treaty the policy of the president is to seek at the review conference the indefinite and unconditional extension of that treaty in addition tosetting out findings my amendment says three things first it expresses the sense of the congress that the president has the full support of the congress in seeking the indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons second we urge the president as soon as possible to fill those positions at the unitedstates

may 22 in recognition of the crossing of the atlantic ocean by the nations first steamship the s s savannah in the year 1819 this year on its birthday the unitedstates maritime industry receives an unwelcome birthday present because the clinton administration strongly influenced by the department of defense and others last week announced that it will not be offering maritime reform legislation everyone in this chamber painfully is aware of the divergent views within the industry as to what is the best course of action to place unitedstates maritime industries on a level playing field in a global economy where virtually every other merchant fleet is subsidized but what i particularly find egregious is the fact that the department of defense is of the opinion that weas a nationhave no future need for a privatelyowned merchant fleet why you may ask would our military take such a hard line position given the fact that it relies heavily on merchant shipping in times of war or national emergency during every major foreign military engagement in our nations history at least 95 percent of all ordnance equipment and supplies needed by our military and by our allies was carried by ship the recent persian gulf war was no exception that requirementocean transportationhas not changed the most efficient and effective way of transporting the enormous volume of military equipment and supplies is by ocean transport quite simply there is no equal what has changed is our militarys philosophy or policy governing ocean transportation the military particularly the navy has developed its own fleet of sealift ships some governmentowned some governmentchartered and controlledsome even carrying government cargoes that ought to be carried by our privatelyowned commercial fleet still others are held in the reserve fleet in short the navy has created a second merchant fleet by using in my opinion vessel utilization strategies and creative interpretations of existing laws that favors its own captive government fleetall at the expense of our active commercial merchant marine as i mentioned one component of the governments fleet is the national defense reserve force and its subcomponent the ready reserve force like many of my colleagues in the house and senate i supported the ndrf and the creation of the rrf because i saw it as a critical source from which we quickly could supplement our active fleet in times of national emergency or war what the congress failed to foresee was the navys intentionspecifically the military sealift commands intentionto expand its mission to become the nations largest ship operator and largest deepsea employer dod is nationalizing our merchant fleet this must not be allowed to stand maritime reform legislation died critics say because it was framed around subsidies that the federal government could no longer afford my response is that we cannot afford not to pay vessel operating subsidies or some other form of operating fiscal support it is ironic that the congress and the administration can find billions upon billion of dollars for agricultural subsidies educational subsidies welfare subsidies or for study after study on a wide range of subjects and issues that often borders on the ridiculous yet is more than willing to write off an industry that plays a crucial role in the defense and the economy of this great nation the figure we are talking about is approximately 350 million a year or less to keep more than 100 modern unitedstates flag ships operating in our foreign trades and remember of this 3250 million nearly onehalf will be returned the same year in personal and corporate taxes it is money put to work in our economy that generates jobs and a defense capability and helps our balance trade military planners were unwilling to support maritime reform because they say it is too expensive that our merchant ahlps in the international trades are not necessary for a military surge deployment or to sustain that mission what our military planners are saying is that foreign flag ships ar readily availabe such as was the case in the persian gulf when more than 140 foreicnowned ships were chsare military vjlnera with an ele on the bottom line are selling one of the most important oomponents of our natlonal defense down the drain but we as a nation will not see the results of t his misguided policy until it is too lateafter all of our ships have been reflagged crewed with foreigners and they are no longer available to assist our military opponents of continued assistance to our merchant fleet will say that forelgn lag ehipowners will not let the united states down that they will make their ships available they may be right to a degree the ships will be avalable for a price a very high price but what about the crews will they be available there is no clear definitive answer to that question our military quickly points to the successes of operations desert shield and desert storm when foreign flag vessels were used extensively i believe our military establishment is making a serious mistake by assuming that in all future engagements the united states will have the same cooperation from foreign governments as it enjoyed in the persian gulf conflict they also do not tell you about the foreignflag vessels that refused to carry gulf war cargoes and the foreign crews that refused to sail when we needed them but after all these men and same planners who testified before the subcommittee on merchant marine a few years ago and asserted during a paper exercise conducted at the unitedstates transportation command that all 96 vessels in the ready reserve force ware broken out successfully within the allotted time frame such an assumption was not based on reality at that same bearing i questioned another witness vice adm paul butcher the thencommander of the miitary sealift command about the probability of repeating in the real world the successes gained during the paper the admiral to his credit agreed with me that getting any vessel out of the reserve fleet would be extremely difficult unless it is given great attention and strictly maintained my views on that subject which were supported by admiral butcher proved to be correct during the breakout of rrf vessels during operation desert shield unitedstates shipyards and other companies engaged to breakout rrf vessels found it extremely difficult to meet their tar getdates i am convinced the same serious miscalculations are being made in this case when the military assumes cooperation between the unitedstates government and foreign governments will give us unlimited access to foreign flag vessels and foreign crews if we are to learn from history we must look back to other unitedstates military involvements such as korea vietnam and yes the persian gulf war foreign seamen whether they work for its or foreign vessel owners have no loyalty or allegiance to unitedstates flag or to unitedstates objectivesobjectives to which we may commit our young men and women to combat we have witnessed time and time again how foreign crews have refused to man vessels destined to carry supplies and equipment into us military theaters of operation the only reliable seamen who will answer the call support the objectives of the united states and support the unitedstates military are unitedstates seamen if we proceed down this foolish path on which the administration is leading us and unitedstates vessels now engaged in the international liner trade eventually are reflagged where will we obtain the trained skilled seamen that will be needed to man vessels broken out of the rrf precipitous xeductions in unitedstates deepsea jobs will create a void that will be impossible to fill we only have to look at the experiences we endured during operation desert shield when there was a critical shortage of unitedstates radiomen and other crafts needed to man reserve vessels vessels were delayed until men could be recalled from retirement and placed back on active duty officials of the office of management and budget during their deliberations concerning maritime reform legislation with other federal agencies said that maritime reform was too expensive that the federal government could not afford to underwrite operating subsidies for unitedstates liner vessels competing with cheaper foreign vessels given the importance of a strong merchant marine for commercial and national defense the question must be asked how can we afford not to keep this industry afloat consider if you will the fact that unitedstates taxpayers spent 17 billion this year to support american agricultural interestsmany of them multinational conglomerates and some of them even foreign owned part of that effort was the expenditure of unitedstates taxpayer dollars to help promote unitedstates agricultural products in foreign nations the administration has included in its fiscal year 1994 budget 147 million for this program while the program may assist in the promotion and export of unitedstates commoditiesand there is no proof that it does even tha4 i question the wisdom of using taxpayers dollars to support companies like sunklst growers which received 366 9 million between iiscal years 1986 and 1992 blue diamond 35 7 million sunsweet growers 191 million and dole foods 14 9 million these companies should be using their own advertising dollars to promote their product line hot tax dollars according to a recent article in the washington post dole foods which received nearly 15 million in federal aid for supermarket promotions in japan and magazine ads in europe reported 570 million profits during the same period it was receiving federal aid supporters of this program argue that promoting unitedstates exports creates unitedstates jobs how can anyone argue with that yet that is precisely the same argument in partfor continuation of the

condition we are not able to renovate properly or even do adequate maintenance in the case of a project in new orleans la known as the desire street project we find frankly some of the most miserable housing conditions in america regretfu 1y although one of the largest housing units today it is one of the lower in occupancy because the units have continued to deteriorate the quality of life there is miserable and accordingly suffers from a very highrate of crime the most efficient and logical thing for us to do is not to continue to invest additional dollars in this very large and inefficient unit but to allow the housing authority there locally to use their best initiatives in using zcarce taxpayer dollars to create quality housing opportunities for those who really need it it will reduce the total number of housing units structurally available but in fact will increase more units for those who really need it in the neworleans areathis waiver provision for the oneforone housing rule is a very important provision and 1 wish to commend not only the chairman of the full committee the gentleman from texas but the gentlemaf from massachusetts who has been a strong advocate for housing in our nation as well as the gentlewoman from new jersey for her hard work in working this compromise language in the process the result i believe is not only a gain for those in need of public housing but more importantly asignificant gain for the american taxpayer because it means scarce resources will be more effectively utilized to provide quality housing for those who need it and not to be constrained by artificial rules that force us to continue in a very inefficient wad irresponsible manner i appreciate the leadership of those on the committee on banking finance and urban affairs for inclusion of this provision i am happy to work with them in seeing its adoption"], [0.010978400707244873, 0.4890215992927551, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 2343 was reported by the foreign affairs committee without objection on june 10 this bill was considered by the subcommittee on economic policy trade and the environment on june 9 and similarly reported without objection during the subcommittees consideration chairman gzjdenson and i engaged in a colloquy to explain the bill this measure is necessary to correct a constitutional problem with the log export legislation that congress passed in n may 4 a federal appeals court overturned that legislation on the grounds that it unconstitutionally compelled a governor to regulate log exports on public lands the bill we bring before you today vests the regulatory authority in the secretary of commerce he is given authority to redelegate this authority to a governor upon request this meets the constitutional test this legislation applies primarily in the pacific northwest in particular the state of washington it affects logging only on public lands not private property and most important to me it is a consensus bill it is supported by all members of the washington state delegation it is supported by the timber industry and it is supported by the governor of the state of washington and congresswoman jennifer dunn also is in support of this legislation and her statement of support will be included for the record without ths legislation there will not be a sound legal basis for properly managing the timber resources on public land in washington state therefore i urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan consensus bill"], [0.012616872787475586, 0.5126168727874756, 1, "we have just heard the argument that one of the reasons we should get rid of the icc is that it is old the constitution is older logic would suggest we get rid of the constitution the magna carta is older perhaps great britain should get rid of that the bible also that is the kind of logic we have been hearing all morning and afternoon long on this bill what we have been hearing is wishful thinking masquerading as fact members have been subjected to arguments and a wish list they have not been subjected to many facts let me try and bring some facts to this debate and make three points first the kind of work that the icc performs adjudications investigations the resolution of complaints between shippers and carriers and oversight of our nations surface transportation industries are best performed by an independent regulatory commission that point has been stated over and over and over again by the transportation industries themselves by shippers and carriers and labor and local communities they are best served by an independent regulatory commission and with decisions that are openly arrived at they do not want these functions transferred to an executive branch agency we heard very early in the debate that the only people that support that is organized labor let me add to the list the national coal association consolidated freightways omni tracks inc a small railroad the regional railroads of america and the association of american railroads that was a fact given earlier that was simply incorrect and wrong mr chairmani the second point i would like to make is that the department of transportation does not have the expertise to handle the functions of the icc they have told us so dot does not want the functions of the icc to be transferred they have told us so the committee on public works and transportation andthe committee on energy and commerce held a joint hearing last week in which we investigated exactly this issue and found a number of very interesting things including this question asked by the gentleman from california could you tell us whether or not the department of transportation would be in a position to assume all of the current icc responsibilities and functions the representative of dot said we would not be in such a position because there are areas of expertise that are really unique to the icc that would need to be built up for the department again the question we would have is what would be the point of just having to develop that ekpertise the second issue really is there have been different ways of reassigning these functions to dot that have been considered but there would be insufficient funds to do that he said what we have is we really need to set up an entire mechanism to provide the kind of isolation and insulation in what are really in many respects fundamentally quasijudicial functions and decisions what again said the dot representative is the pointof having to do that except to show that it is theoretically possible in some convoluted way to do so when it does not seem like a good exercise of anybodys time the fact is that this amendment acknowledges that problem by requiring thetransfer of all of the workers at theicc o the new quarters in the transpo tatin building and that does not sould very efficient to me however even if we should go along with this juryrigged scheme of first cutting off the funding and then coming back after the fact and eliminating the interstate commerce commission or the interstate commerce act or some of the functions if we accept that we are just shuffling a ounld desks and bodies and responsibilities there will be no regulation no oversight no cop on the beat for surface transportation and we still do not save any money let me repeat that mr chairman that even after sacrificing the independent regulatory system that has been the support of the shippers and carriers who depend upon its ability to undertake expert disintiltested adjudication we do not savb anymoney"]]}
