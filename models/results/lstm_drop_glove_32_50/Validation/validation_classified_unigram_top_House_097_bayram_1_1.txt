proposal for massive increases in military spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one study found a complicated overlapping management system among the four branches of the armed services causes costly repetition of equipment maintenance base supervision and other services generating massive amounts of waste"], [0.3999549150466919, 0.6000450849533081, 1, "the major goal of american health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [0.41538453102111816, 0.5846154689788818, 1, "it is an honor to be able to commemorate january 28 as the

the gentlemans remarks the truth of the matter is that nobody knows the defense department is very confusedabout how to deploy the missiles do you know that the secretary of the air force did not know the decision to employ the missiles in fixedbased silos until it was made so while i think this basing system proposed by the secretary of defense is perhaps one option i thin~k it is a very bad option i would like to see it go back to the drawing board while i do not oppose the concept of deploying a new missile in some basing mode deploying it in a permanent system in fixedbased holes around my hometown which was not good enough for senator laxalt is not going to be good enough for me unless i can be shown that it is a survivable and a nonvulnerable missile after a great deal of thought i have also concluded that the whether the mx missile bi bomber provisions in the defense appropriations bill will not enhance the nations defense program and if deployed may even weaken our ability to adequately meet the strategic requirements of the united states this decision was not an easy one there is no doubt in my mind that an upgrading of our military programs is necessary the question is what will be the best approach my overriding concern is that the bi and mx proposals are considered to be interim measures until more advanced technologies come on line at the cost of 1 9 billion for the mx missile and the 2 4 billion for the bi for fiscal year 1982 alone i would say these are very costly interim programs the expense of which may threaten the adequancy of funding for advanced programs such as the stealth or additional trident submarines further i am not convinced about the capability of either the bi or the mx as currently proposed will the b1 meet our penetrating bomber requirement that much better than existing b52s do is it worth 29 billionor possibly 40 billion as the congressional budget office estimates to find out at 300 million a piece the bi should be a wonder plane but it is not it appears to me that a stealthtype bomber with its radar evasion capability represents the kind of technology that we should aggressively pursue the pentagon estimates that a stealth bomber could be on line as early as 1989 we should be making an all out effort to meet the goal and not spread ourselves too thinly with interim approachs of questionable effectiveness i do not reject the argument that our penetrating bomber force may need to be revamped and for that reason supported an amendment that deleted production funds for the bi while adding funds for an alternate bomber option the fb11l as an interim penetrator the fb111 would have similar capability and would be available a year sooner than the bi further 155 fb111 would cost about onethird the amount of 100 bis or a little over 13 billion the amendment failed as did the later amendment that simply struck production funds for the bi while retaining research and development funding i supported the latter amendment as well my goal and i am sure the goal of my colleagues here in the house is to help put together the best program possible for protecting our vital security interests

wish to summarize the debate to this point if i might as i see it by asking three questions first with reference to the airlift issue i would ask where we have been with it and where we are today and the third question is where are we going in the early 1970s a delegation of us went overseas to israel during the yom kippur war and during that operation as a delegation from the committee on armed services and some from other committees we went to the african side in egypt with a delegation of israeli soldiers we went back to the sinai across the suez canal with the egyptian soldiers and there we saw the ravages of war and we saw where the israelis had come back and drawn that battle to a stalemate we met with president sadat i think it was the first time that any initiative had been made along with secretary of state kissinger to enlist his efforts in behalf of peace president sadat told our delegation that the c5 in the operation and then coming to the rescue of the israelis was the envy of egypt i was there and he told us that he said were it not for the operation of the c5 airlift it would have been all over and the stalemate would never have been achieved he said that if he were choosing he would choose the unitedstates efforts in preference to that of the soviets any time as a former air force pilot i have flown early vintage airlift airplanes called the boxcars we have hauled trucks and jeeps we have dropped by monorail and we have dropped the paratroopers the issue then is the issue of results and we have seen the results that is were we have been we have been to the persian gulf area and we have seen results they are the results of success where are we today the point that i shall make at this point is as follows according to a congressionally mandated mobility study by this congress the outside requirements in current shortfalls in airlift are as follows we have the 77 c5s that is true but even with that it would require the other 50 c5s which are to be authorized in the authorization bill to achieve sufficient airlift capacity to meet the requirements of this country presently in the middle east scenario with trouble there it would require as an outside requirement in tons 39 880 tons the shortfall with the present 77 c5s is 63 percent and of course that cannot be handled at all with the 747s the second scenario is the persian gulf and there the outside requirements in tons are 24 790 tons with a shortfall with the present fleet of c5a of 28 percent the worst case is the case of nato where the scenario calls for 129 250 tons with a shortfall of 80 percent finally if nato and the persian gulf should occur the shortfall is 43 870 tons with a 58 percent shortfall with the present c5as nowhere in the military fleet is there the capacity to do this so therefore the issue is whether or not we want to do it and whether or not we propose to do it the final question is where we are going let us draw the issue narrowly with reference to the c5 mr chair man i would like to have the chart brought around by the pages if the members do not mind all right we have before us on your right if you will notice it there there pictures which are being brought around i would like to see the comparison between the c5 and the 747 if we can bring in that picture for the members if that issue is to be decided in favor of the c5 then we will have achieved a capacity sufficient to meet the needs shown in the chart here before us the c17 is another issue it will be a fine addition to the fleet later the development decision on the c17 will be made in the latter part of this decade the operational deliveries will be made in the early 1990s to replace the c130 and the c141 airplanes"], [0.4272618591785431, 0.4272618591785431,

could state it in simple nonlegal terms so that we could understand what all of the lawyers on the judiciary committee were talking about so i am convinced as i know many of my colleagues are that george brought to the judiciary committee not only that competence as a lawyer but also an ability to communicate those ideas that you were working on there in a positive and constructive and understandable way i was proud when i was asked to submit his name to our governor in california as a potential judge on our appellate court because i knew that george danielson would do an excellent job in that capacity even though on many of the political issues george and i had differed as to point of view because he knows the judicial branch of our government he understands it and he has a sense of justice and fairness that you do not always find among people who are being asked to serve in that area so i was more than proud to not only recommend in writing that he become a member of the appellate court but one night my colleague the gentleman from california and i had an opportunity to have dinner with our fine governor and we did have a chance to aggressively tell our governor that we wished he would hurry up and get the job done and appoint george to the bench because he was competent and the judiciary in california would be well served with his appointment i am convinced with the double whammy that my colleague the gentleman from california and i were able to pass on to our governor that we moved the process along maybe a little faster so in any regard i join with my distinguished colleague from california who has taken this time to say thank you george danielson for the fine service you gave to the house of representatives wu will look forward to seeing you in court i hopei donot have to come to your court but if i do we look forward to seeing you in those black robes and we know you will do well"], [0.42780381441116333, 0.5721961855888367, 1, "i rise to

restrictions on its use rather than canceling its use section 6 b of fifra entitles persons adversely affected by a proposed cancellation action to challenge this decision in an administrative hearing epa in reviewing registered pesticides for possible unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment through the rpar process has utilized the risk benefit analysis as a result in many cases is able to continue the use of pesticides by incorporating restrictions such as usage limitations improved application directions or more emphatic label warnings epa in 1979 made an administrative decision in interpretation of adversely affected that only registrants and users of pesticides which are those with an economic interest in the continued registration of a pesticide were entitled to a hearing under section 6 b the public interest groups although they may have participated in the rpar process still feel they should be able to demand an administrative hearing to challenge this type of action saying it has not gone far enough and that in effect the pesticide use should be canceled the public interest groups unsuccessfully challenged this administrative ruling in court the court ruled that congress intended to provide an administrative hearing only when a pesticide use is being canceled not when its use is being retained conditionally since the public interest groups have an input in the rpar process and have the opportunity to appear before the fifra scientific advisory panel all before the final decision is made and then may challenge this refusal to cancel in federal district court under the provision of section 16 a i feel that adequate safeguards have been provided and this amendment should be rejected i might point out that the subcommittee considered this proposal during its deliberations and determined that such language was not needed for those who are more interested in the details of this issue i will continue further the rosenthal amendment to section 6 b of fifra provides that whenever epa proposes to place regulatory restrictions on a product any interested person may compel epa to hold a courtroomtype cancellation hearing for the purpose of determining whether even greater restrictions should be imposed on the product than those epa decided on my prob lem with this amendment is not with its underlying conceptthat any interested member of the public should be able to request stricter regulatory action my problem is with the procedure chosen to do thisthe formal courtroomi ype cancellation hearing a cancellation hearing is a lengthy timeconsuming resourceconsuming piece of litigation it is simply bad law and bad policy to make cancellation hearings the vehicle for regulatory decisions as to how strictly pesticides should be regulated yet that would be the primary effect of the rosenthal amendment i believe that all interested persons should have an input into epa decisions as to how strictly to regulate pesticides but as i will show that opportunity is already provided under current law during the administrative review process because cancellation hearings under section 6 b are really formal litigation they serve a very narrow purpose it would be a grave mistake to adopt the rosenthal amendment and thereby turn them into something they were never intended to be and that is essentiallyunworkablea forum for deciding how strictly to regulate pesticides the issue raised by the rosenthal amendment is not whether environmental groups should have the same right to demand a cancellation hearing under section 6 b as a pesticide registrant that is a false issue rather the issue is what is the proper time and place for the public to have input on how strictly a product should be regulated is the proper procedure as i contend for the public to make its beliefs known during the agencys regulatory review process or is the proper procedure as mr rosewhal contends to decide regulatory issues through administrative litigationthat is to let any person demand that a formal courtroomlike cancellation hearing be held to redecide how strictly to regulate a product whenever a person feels that epa has not been strict enough i believe that cancellation hearings under section 6 b should not be the forum for redeciding regulatory issues the proper time for the public to comment on how strictly to regulate a product is during the administrative review process if anyone thinks that epa was not strict enough after an administrative review that person has the right to take epa to court under section 16 a of fifra and ask the court to review what epa has done cancellation hearings serve the narrow purpose of giving a registrant a right to due process of law if his product is going to be canceled they should not be expanded as proposed in the rosenthal amerdment into a device for deciding anew epa decisions that a person does not like i believe the logic of my position becomes even more clear when one understands the different purposes served by administrative review on the one hand and by cancellation hearings on the other epa decisions as to whether to impose restrictions on a product or even cancel a product are made in an administrative review process called an rpar rebuttal presumption against registration every person has a full right to participate in this regulatory process and to urge that a product be strictly regulated and to provide to epa any data or arguments in support of his position if the person feels that epa has not been strict enough at the conclusion of the rpar he can sue epa in federal court and obtain review of epas decision this is in fact made crystal clear in an amendment in h r 5203 to section 16 of fifra concerning judicial review in summary epa has found based on many years of experience that the administrative review or rpar is the best procedure for deciding how strictly to regulate and that is the proper time and place for the public to participate and express its views on how a product should be regulated in contrast a cancellation hearing under section 6 b serves a very different and narrow purpose when epa proposes to cancel a product the registrants and other adversely affected persons can request a formal hearing to protect their procedural right to make sure that the cancellation is carried out in accordance with due prdcess of law cancellation hearings are very rare very expensive for the taxpayer very time consuming and resource consuming and very burdensome on epa there have been only a handful of such hearings since epa was created in 1970for ddt aldrin and dieldren heptachlor and chlordane and 2 4 5t they typically last for a minimum of 6 months and can take years to complete they consist of an administrative trial conducted in the same manner as a trial in federal court they require the public to foot the bill for the time of a team of agency lawyers and administrative law judge they take epa scientists away from their duties and require them to spend time testifying and in crossexamination for periods of days or weeks because cancellation hearings are rare they are an acceptable procedure for protecting registrants due process rights to a hearing but they are clearly an ineffective and undesirable mechanism for making routine decislons as to how strictly epa should regulate particular products they result in legal decisions made by lawyers and administrative judges not in regulatory decisions made by epa scientists and policymakers if the rosenthal amendment were adopted epa would be inundated with these cancellation hearings the amendment would give extraordinary power to a single individual to tie up epas regulatory resources in unproductive litigation a single person could demand a hearing on virtually every epa regulatory decision and force epa to spend months or years trying its case before an administrative law judge after the agency had alfeady fully considered the evidence and reached a decision through its administrative review this clearly would be unwise the law should stay as it is the public should provide its input during the administrative review at the time when epa makes its regulatory decisions if a cancellation hearing is held of course the public should continue to have the right as it does now to participate in it and the public should continue to have the right as it does now to get judicial review of epa regulatory decisions but a person should not be able to tie epa in knots by demanding that lengthy and expensive cancellation hearings be held whenever they feel that epa has not been quite strict enough epa should spend its resources regulating not litigating for these reasons i oppose the rosenthal

consideration to the way in which they will vote on representative findleys administration bill to repeal the final adjustment of the dairy price support the most obviouq and compelling reason to reject this proposal is that it is a callous breach of faith with americas dairy farmers 4 years ago we voted in favor of passage of the 1977 farm bill among other things this legislation mandated the continuation of a successful government program which maintained stability in the market for a commodity precious to millions of americans milk the milk price support program should be looked at in an historical context in the early 1970s president nixon attacked the program publicly and held down prices while allowing increased imports consequently an average of 20 000 dairy operations per year went out of business for 3 consecutive years milk production dropped and what followed was the sharpest increase in dairy prices ever experienced by consumers it should be noted that in the years that the present 80 percent of parity support price has been in effect the increase in the cost of dairy products has gone up at an average rate of 12 percent less than the price rise of all other foods thus the consumer has benefited greatly from the stability this program has there is no question that we must make some effort to reduce the government stocks of dairy products on hand there is no disagreement on the issue itself but rather on the method by which it is done perhaps as important as revising the price support mechanism is the question of changing the commodity credit corporations ccc sellback policy currently the ccc buys up milk and dairy products stores these commodities and then sells the stores back to processors at 105 percent of the current purchase price obviously with interest rates over 15 percent processors have no incentive to retain inventories instead they use the ccc as their reserve and months later buy back stocks at what amounts to a mere 5 percent increase or loan nor does the processor pay any of the warehousing costs in essence the taxpayers subsidize the storage costs which figure large into the usdas dairy program and pay the added interest rate as well the sellback price should be raised this would reduce the cost of the program milk productionand overproductionis clearly related to the price of grain and feed during the past 2 yearsuntil just recentlygrain prices were very low more cows were kept because feed was cheap milk prices were steady and beef prices were also quite low the result overproduction now with grain prices somewhat higher some dairy cows are being culled out and sold this will reduce production and help bring it into line with demand i realize that farmers constitute only 2 8 percent of the nations populace and an even smaller percentage is involved in dairy farming for this reason i submit that the dairy vote has become a symbolic rather than a substantive one the record will demonstrate that i have always been in favor of cutting the costs of government and balancing the federal budget but it will also show that i have treated proposed reductions on a casebycase basis i urge my colleagues then to cast their votes on this question in a manner consistent with fairness to the dairy farmer i came really prepared to make a different speech but i want to address one point that has been repeatedly raised on the minority side today and on occasion from our side and that is that we must not we will not and we shall not ask the dairy farmer to stand alone that all are going to bear this equally this sounds remarkably like the rhetoric of the carter administration when they put on the embargo that the farmer would not bear this burden alone we should all bear it equally let me suggest to my friends on this side of the aisle there is no intention of this administration to ask everybody to bear the cost equally we have been recently for example in another committee at work on an investigation of the energy department and the investigation within the energy department of the special counsels office the proposal of this administration is to trip that office of 80 percunt of its resources this will mean that essentially the 7 billion additional that the american consumer bore because they were overcharged by the oil companies during the price regulated period will go essentially unchallenged the oil companies have already started backing out of tentative agreements to settle out of court now there is no intention of this secretary of energy to bear that cost equally so when we say here today that we are going to insist that all bear it equally i am going to challenge the members of this side of the aisle to join with us when we give them a chance to make good on their commitment today that all shall bear the cost equally of the reagan program because they are not geared to do that if my friend from illinois my friend from minnesota and others join us when we come in on that particular issue i will begin to believe some of tle rhetoric about all bearing it equally but as of this date i have no inclination whatsoever

and take into consideration actions toward the united states since the 1978 weapons sale true saudi willingness to cooperate with the united states is most accurately reflected in saudi oil policy however instead of supporting oil price moderation saudi arabia instigated the rapid escalation of opec oil prices after the iranian revolution and has continued its threats to reduce oil production the saudi arabians also threatened the carter administration with oil cutbacks if the president complied with the congressional mandate to resume filling the strategic petroleum reserve a stance of competely unwarranted interference with american policy while saudi arabia moderated its oil prices to a minor degree after the 1978 f15 sale international analysts believe it did so more to assert its own independence within opec rather the aid the american oil consumer when former president carter pro posed the 1978 arms sale to the senate he wrote in a letter that the sale of planes to saudi arabia would cement their ties to the united states and advance the cause of moderation in the area however instead of supporting the first peace agreement to be reached between israel and egypt the saudis opposed the peacemaking efforts of the united states by leading the arab league in condemning the treaty and organizing an economic and political boycott of egypt in may 1979 president sadat

with egypt the saudi arabians have redoubled their support of the plo since the signing of twe camp david agreement currently they provide major finan cial assistance to the plo and support its

protecting the house of saud against subversion or revolt indeed if the saudi monarch cannot survive open accomnodation with israel it is hardly a safe depository for all that dangerous hardware therefore before future plans are finalized to sell weapons to the saudis we must in return receive some concessions these should include upholding the agreements of the 1978 arms deal dropping their

be legislating on taxes in appropriations conferences i think that the beauty of amendment number 62 is that we go back to where the law was and we then allow the committee on ways and means to do whatever they are going to do at whatever time they are going to do it with the bill the chairman is introducing today i think that is the clean clearcut way to do it we got ourselves in this mess

they give up on last year because the last year is over and done with for the next year the year we are in now we get the 3 000 exemption and then obviously that is the way it is unless somebody amends it in the future my understanding of what the myers amendment does is that it does not reenact the 3 000 limit according to what the gentleman said it would allow members to write off their

the social security minimum benefit restoration bill i want to commend the conferees on their hard work on thiscrucisl matter we all realize that a social security conference is never easy ai~d the serious nature of the financial difficulties facing our social security system made this conference report very important prom the beginning i have protested the administrations plan to eliminate the minimum benefit i am pleased that the conference committee agreed to reverse repeal of the minimum benefit for current recipients this action is a positive first step the conference report before us authorizes interfund borrowing among all three social security trust funds until december 31 1982 this provision addresses the immediate shortterm financial priblemis of the social security system but it is iot a remedy for the longrange ills of the system the need remains clear and strong for more substantive action in this regard i have been doing a lot of research and studying anid talking to my constituents in northwest iowa about how we can save social security in the long term through forums conducted in june throughout the sixth district through public meetings i held in august and through many valuable letters i have received helpful suggestions from my constituents on how we can preserve our social security system in a fair and evenhanded manner as a result just a few weeks ago i introduced three bills which would save the system without hurting present and future retirees my package of bills would include the following provisions first would preclude payment of all social security benefits to convicted criminals second would increase the costofliving adjustments by either the rise in the cpi or the wage index whichever is lower and third would redirect the system back toward its original purpose by financing hospital insurance from general revenues experts tell us that the retirement and survivors fund will come up short by an estimated 80 9 billion in the next 5 years and that the system will need 110 6 billion in the years 198790 thus as best we can tell social security will need about 191 5 billion more in 198190 in order to continue paying benefits my social security package is projected to save social security at least 213 billion i say at least because i am referring only to my bills which address the costofliving adjustments and the funding of hospital insurance additional savings would result from the elimination of social security benefits to prisonersabout 17 million in i believe that my proposals address both the short and longterm problems of the social security system it is not a bandaid plan that will fix the system tempo1tarily rather these bills if adopted will assure finaircial stability at least through the next decade it is my feeling that once and for all we must solve the financial problems of our social security system in the past we have not been accurate in estimating the financial needs of the system and we have time and time again relied on raising taxes i believe that we do not have to resort to raising taxes or significantly cutting benefits by accepting a plan that will clearly restore the integrity to the system and build confidence in social security by accepting the conference report on h r 4331 we are taking the first step a positive step in the right direction the restoration of the minimum benefit for current retirees will finally put an end to the uncertainty that so many retirees had to face during the past months from the beginning i felt that we should not have inflicted such uncertainty and fear upon our elderly by inactioni in this vital area it has been a difficult fight in congresiz but 1 for one am ready to do n~a i urge my colleagues to sup~ort this conference

congressman joseph l fisher from virginia joe has given me a brief statement which i want to read so all the members of the house will be aware of it joe writes as follows we are all saddened that gladys spellman has to give up her seat in the house her contributions to policy and legislation on behalf of her maryland constituents and the nation have been important no member has been more finely attuned to the needs problems and aspirations of government employeescivil postal militarythan congresswoman spellman or congressperson spellperson as she would say tongue in cheek i shall always treasure my own friendship with gladys which began long before our period together in congress when we fought the battles for better government in the national capital region in the council of governments metro and other arenas gladys has left her own distinctive mark on all public issues and institutions with which she has been associated things are better becaume of what she has done we long for her recovery and her return to public life we need her mature judgment her political savvy her charm her devotion to the general welfare thank you gladys for all you have done god bless you that is the statement of one whom we all know one of gladys closest friends joe fisher i want to comment about some of the issues this could take all afternoon i do not have all afternoon but i want to comment about some of the issues gladys put her heart and soul into here in the house one of which was the construction of a beautiful and really firstclass public transportation system for the nations capital while many local officials have made important contributions to the construction of the washington area subway system i think it is fair to say that gladys spellmans contribution in this respect has been simply remarkable her efforts in the early years as a county commissioner were critical in laying the groundwork for what was to become the system 19e are building and using today she not only had the foresight to see what was possible many years ago but in her subsequent roles as chairperson of the washington suburban transit commission as vice president of the local council of governments as a council member in prince georges county and finally as the fifth districts congressional representative gladys worked diligently to translate her ideas into reality there were many who observing the often fractious nature of interjurisdictional relations in this area said that producing a firstrate subway system in the nations capital just couldnt be done gladys is one of the reasons why in fact it has been done most recently gladys worked in a collective effort with the other metro supporters in the congress for passage of the starkharris bill in the 96th congress providing for completion of the 101mile system now in existence today another issue is the baltimorewashington parkway one of the reasons gladys is appreciated really on a daily basis by her constituents and by all of us in maryland was her work to overcome delays in government and other obstacles which had been putting off resurfacing and upgrading of the baltimorewashington parkway when it became apparent that longstanding disagreements between federal and state transportation agencies were precluding needed repairs from being performed on this highway gladys went to work as only gladys can she used her considerabb influence here in the congress to win a federal appropriation for the work because the highway is maintained by the park service she then worked closely with high way officials to make certain that the work was done quickly and done with a minimum of disruption to the commuters on the highway if this does not strike some as a major accomplishment just ask any of the thousands of hapless commuters who endured the potholes and other dangerous conditions on that highway while the various governmental agencies could not agree on how to go forward on the repairs this is a good illustration i thinkand that is all it is an illustrationof how gladys could tackle a problem and work with all the affected parties and come up with a solution that solves that problem on other local issues she simply worked tirelessly to preserve the impact aid funds for her district to compensate the fifth district for tax revenues lost due to the presence of federally owned land these funds were used to provide a quality education to the children of her district and to prevent placing an unfair tax burden on her local taxpayers she successfully kept intact the beltsville agricultural research center an extremely important part of her community gladys led the fight to keep a toxic waste dump from being located in her congressional district she played an instrumental role in bringing in federal dollars for a very much needed urban renewal project in college park the seat of our great state university and she worked tirelessly with our metro caucus in the house on regional issues in addition to the metro system in an effort to curb aircraft noise to resolve environmental problems facing the washington area and generally to promote cooperation among the governments and people of the washington area i think those of us who came to know and love gladys in the past years will obviously think of her accomplishments on local issues but i suspect we will remember her most as a master politician one with just extraordinary savvy who understood the political process as few i have ever known and one who could make it work for the people she represented she was the chief advocate in this institution and the chief spokesman for the cause and the interest of federal workers and i can tell you as one who also represents a lot of federal employees that gladys presence in this institution is missed by all of them and by all of us who seek to serve them she was probably the major proponent and executor of better intergovernmental relations in the house she had been president as i mentioned earlier of the national association of countries and nobody in this institution better understood the relationships between the federal state and local governments than gladys and how to fit them together and how to make them work i would like to speak for a moment about what i came to know as i sat here on the floor with gladys hour after hour during debate about the priorities in her life because they transcended the kinds of issues and the politics that i have been discussing foremost in those priorities i think would have to be what the distinguished gentlewoman from louisiana was talking about earlierher love and her loyalty to her family to her friends and to the staff who worked with her so brilliantly her children and her grandchildren were i can attest the most important things in her life i do not know how many times we were on the floor and stood in the back of the chamber when gladys comments turned to something that happened with her children or with her grandchildren she never lost sight of the members of her family despite the tremendous demands of being an active politician in this day and age and we all know she was an indefatigable politician another priority for gladys was her sensitivity to those individuals in our society who have afflictions maybe not many members here knew it but gladys was once blind fortunately she was able to overcome that handicap she understood perhaps because of that better than most the special problems of the handicapped assisting the handicapped and the downtrodden were in many respects chief priorities for gladys spellman as an elected official i could not talk about the priorities that gladys spellman has had without talking about her integrity and her absolute total honesty i gather that she learned from her father henry noonhe was a former head of the d g s stores here in the district of columbia he was known for conducting his business with the highest of ethics and integrity gladys was always guided in her ethics by her father gladys career as a public official was exemplary in that respect as in every other something that has been mentioned by others but i want to underscore was gladys spellmans belief in constituent service the distinguished gentlewoman from new jersey referred to it very eloquently gladys spellman established i am convinced one of the finest constituent services that the united states has ever seen she was always accessible to the people of prince georges county her chief duty as a member of congress she believed was to solve her constituents problems she never deviated from that commitment to her constituents and her everincreasing margins of victory i think were strong testimony to that fact let me say something about another quality of gladys which sometimes is not talked about with politicians but it is so true with her and that is her gutsthe gutsiness of this woman if ever there was a person who knew how to use a velvet glove with the impact of an iron fist it is gladys spellman she is a very gutsy womanon civil rights on issues of concern to women to federal employees to the people of her districtbut she also knew how to get things done in this institution and she accomplished a tremendous amount during her term in the house i want to piuse now to yield to another friend of gladys

substantial increase in retention rates this is indeed cause for jubilation but we should not be blinded by this initial flush of success like a firstperiod touchdown it is exciting to the fans but an awful lot of time still remains on the clock during my election campaign i had the opportunity to talk with literally hundreds of young men and women on active duty in the nations armed forces they were very candid about what was right and what was wrong with a military career these gripe sessions were an education for me even as a vietnam veteran and will prove invaluable in my work on the house armed services committee aside from the obvious concerns about pay medical care family separations and other quality of life items i was particularly impressed by the importance which they placed on education or more correcty the lack of an adequate education program for veterans in a supposed economy move congress in 1976 abolished the gi education bill and replaced it with a contributory plan the postvietnamera veterans education assistance program commonly called veap it has proven to be a dismal failure it is time to rethink this decision and reestablish a more comprehensive education program in return for service in the armed forces during fiscal year 1980 for the first time in several years the services met their numerical recruiting goals this may be only a temporary phenomenon unfortunately due more to the general state of the economy than to the newfound attractiveness of a milltary career in addition we should be very concerned over the caliber of recruits because the percentage of individuals entering the service with high school diplomas continues to decline with the increasing sophistication of our weapons systems we desperately need to raise not lower the education level of our military personnel the current monetary enticements to military service are simply not accomplishing the job they were intended to do frankly i believe we can make a good case to some of the best of our high school graduates who for financial or other reasons are unable to go immediately on to college that they spend a certain number of years in the service of their country in return for substantial federal assistance in financing their educations in the current budgetary dilemma we need to carefully reexamine the 5 billion being spent for federal higher education aid on a nostringsattached basis to determine whether revisions may be required it is not unreasonable for the nations taxpayers to expect some type of repayment in return for an education military service should be the top priority a new gi bill along with adequate pay and selected enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for shortage areas would go a long way toward improving the number of recruits and more importantly the quality as the washington star recently titled an editorial on the issue of military manpower we have a gi bill without gis the nations taxpayers ar underwriting billions of dollars in higher education assistance at a time when our armed forces go begging for good people as the caliber of recruits declines the sophistication of our weaponry increases by leaps and bounds without replacement of the skilled technicians who have left the services in droves in the past few years and a major upgrading of new manpower accessions i fear we are on a collision course now is the time for decisive action we must continue the trend begun last year of assuring that the pay schedule keeps pace with inflation and that special incentive pays and bonuses do not fall so far behind that they become meaningless additionally we should reestablish a 01 bill for education it will not be a cureall and should not be designed as such it should be a

and i would like to commend him for his efforts to call attention to issues that pertain to children which i think represents a foundation of this great country during the first year of the reagan administration we have witnessed repeated threats to the health and educational needs of handicapped childrenin short to their basic constitutional rights early in the year for example there were efforts to repeal public law 94142 the education for all handicapped children act this law enacted in 1975 insures all children in this nation a free and appropriate public education suitable to their individual learning needs efforts to repeal public law 94142 did not succeed but instead drew sharp criticism from concerned citizens and legislators who argued that the repeal of this law would undermine a decade of progress for handicapped children and their families very soon another attack on public law 94142 was launched this time to rob the law of its potency by removing key requirements such as the individualized education plan known popularly as the iep the rights of parents to be involved in the development of their childs educational program and the procedural safeguards due process that enable parents to challenge inappropriate programs or placements for their handicapped child these dismantling efforts were also defeated but the program was soon injeopardy again this time it was the administrations budget proposal that funding for education of the handicapped be included in the block grants to local education agencies leas this effort too was defeated but only for the time being future attempts will be made to alter this important program and these must also be turned aside for a number of reasons funding education of the handicapped out of general education block grants made to the states for their overall education needs would surely result in a scramble for funds already reduced by 25 percent to 38 percent or more such a scramble would be most unfair to handicapped children and their families a recent gao study clearly demonstrates that this type of competition for resources under a block grant program to the states would lead to inadequate or inappropriate programs for many specialneeds children this study shows that the state in which a child lives affects the quality of education that a child receives the study also indicates that school districts with fewer resources are likely to exclude handicapped children from receiving special educational services another serious curtailment of services to the handicapped will occur through the removal of federal regulations responsible for tracking the states education money because the states will be required to do no reporting there is no assurance that handicapped children will be served at all in a given state under a block grant system the repeal of this reporting requirement if allowed amounts to a virtual abandonment of federal leadership on behalf of handicapped children in the state of washington for example legislators have taken a cue from the federal block grant fever they have applied the principle at their state level by combining a variety of programs for specialneeds children into a single block grant though it is thought that nearly the same numbers of children are being served it is certain that services are or soon will be seriously cutback under that kind of funding pattern this block grant move at the state level is being challenged by several local school districts serious questions have come up regarding the legality of the plan in that funding for handicapped programs under current law is allocated on a categorical basisthat is handicap by handicap such as deaf blind mentally retarded and so on several suits are pending against the state by the various educational agencles serving these handicapped childrei these organizations recognize that such an allocation of funds will not allow them to serve handicapped children adequately according to existing laws still in effect even if this block grant action in the state of washington does fail and other actions that undermine programs for the handicapped in other states are turned back additional threats to programs for education of the handicapped are on the horizon most recent is a plan from omb for fiscal year 1983 which proposes a block grant made up of moneys for several special programs for handicapped institutionalized gifted and other special students a current estimate is that this proposal will result in as much as a 65 percent reduction in funds for special programs for children in need of specific kinds of educational services those of us who believe in the constitutional rights of every member of our society to a free public education cannot sit by and watch the legislative gains of the last two decades be wiped out education of the handicapped has proven itself to be a wise investment in preserving human worth as well as societies
