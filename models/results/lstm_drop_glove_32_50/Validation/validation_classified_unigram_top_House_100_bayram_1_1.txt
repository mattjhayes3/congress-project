h r 177 the goal of that legislation is to help meet the food needs of homeless people an issue the committee has looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month effective third exempts housing assistance payments made on behalf of households living in temporary quarters from consideration as income for food stamp purposes such payments will not be counted if the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the

it is beginning to look like we are never going to get a chance as members to offer any kind of amendments that may really need to be considered i am also very much concerned about that process that has been used here there have not been hearings there are a lot of questions that need to be answered for instance it really bothers me that this transfer of this 50 million for homeless will be taken out of the fema funds since i am from an area that is prone to have disastersnot necessarily at this time of the year but at other times of the yeari really worry about their ability to respond to a major disaster then i have the question what about the traditional assistance programs for the poor why are they not taking care of these homeless needs housing needs it is not as if we have not had a considerable amount of assistance going into that area fema has received 370 million for its emergency food and shelter program since 1983 millions of other dollars have gone into such programs as usdas emergency feeding program a billion dollars in surplus commodities since 1982 50 million a year for distribution costs and 75 million for emergency feeding centers then you have the hhs program for runaway and homeless youth 23 million general revenue sharing goes to cities and states they could use that money for this purpose blockgrant funds so it is not as if we have been ignoring the problem in this particular area i also wonder since this was just done in the committee on appropriations have we had adequate hearings have we really looked into it who are these people do they really want to be brought in off the streets ther e is also a constitutional question here the courts have ruled that we cannot go out and just take these people and force them into housing how do you address that question but the main concern that i have is that this is another crash program and when you have crash programs like this even though there is a time sensitivity here you tend to make a mess for instance just this past sunday there was a frontpage article in a local newspaper that pointed out that there are at least 12 apartments in washington dc for the homeless that are being paid

make is that a number of savings and loans a number of the strongest savings and loans in the country right now are those that engage in direct investments they are allowed under state law and if we were to halt this practice by this amendment we would weaken the savings and loans the gentleman mentioned some studies that i will have to admit i have not seen i am aware though that a mr scott

association in which he said in the 2 years in which he was in charge of liquidation of failed fslicinsured institutions over 50 institutions were placed in receivership and 26 were so badly scarred

of direct investments in real estate they failed because of fraud incompetence and criminality which was not deterred or detected early enough and which has little if anything to do with the ability to make direct equity investments or with broader asset powers he goes on to say that despite strong assertions by some i can see no basis to claim that direct investment authority is a cause of increased failure or a risk to the fslic i am just saying that the direct investment as a matter of practice as a matter of empirical evidence has made a number of institutions stronger not weaker there is no evidence that that is the genesis of this problem i certainly urge that we defeat this amendment i rise in opposition to the pending amendment and i would like to address a major issue in this debate namely whether direct investments really are riskier than traditional mortgages i dont really know the answer to this question but the crucial point is that neither does the federal home loan bank board so far the bank board has failed to demonstrate that direct investments cause savings and loans to fail what it has done is to resort to some empirical evidence of an association between direct investments and costly failure and to ignore evidence presented by prof george benston of the university of rochester that direct investments have actually reduced the risk of failure in many cases and that even when failed institutions had direct investments n their portfolio they usually made money on them and failed in spite of profitable direct investments an example of the kind of evidence the bank board has chosen to ignore is a letter sent in november 1985 by scott taylor who at the time was in charge of liquidating failed fslicinsured institutions to george rutland chief executive officer of the california federal savings and loan association who had testified in support of deregulation on behalf of the national council of savings institutions mr taylor said

issue of cargo preference requirements have occurred on this floor the most recent one occurred last fall when the house considered the foreign assistance act during that debate this house voted overwhelmingly to limit the expansion of cargo preference by exempting the export agricultural commodities from additional cargo preference requirements when those commodities are purchased with unitedstates cash transfers to foreign countries it was the opinion of most of my farm colleagues in the house that the cargo preference issue had been again laid to rest however like a bad penny which continues to turn up so does cargo preference today i want to bring to the attention of my colleagues an example of why cargo preference is detrimental to the development of new foreign markets for unitedstates agricultural exports last month it came to my attention that the aid mission in pakistan was attempting to put together a financing package which for the first time would have enabled private sector buyers in pakistan to purchase approximately 200 000 metric tons of corn from the united states this quantity is equivalent to almost 7 400 000 bushels of corn worth over 22 million if this sale had been made it would have been the first major commercial sale of corn to pakistan and it could have opened a significant new market for united states producers the key to the sale was the financing package that would have enabled private sector buyers to consummate the purchase under aids proposal funds would have been available through private sector window of the commodity import program through the cip private sector pakistani buyers would have been able to borrow money from a cip account to purchase united states grain in turn the pakistani buyers would have marketed the corn commercially in that country all was proceeding well however until it was discovered that unitedstates cargo preference requirements applied to the ship of the corn like food assistance programs such as the public law 480 program cargo preference laws require that between 50 to 75 percent of the cargo be shipped on unitedstates flagships under current cargo preference requirements the higher cost of unitedstates flagships must be picked up by the private buyers this would have fncreased the cost of the united states corn to the point that it could not have been sold profitably in the pakistan market the end result in this case was that nobody benefited from cargo preference no united states corn was sold to pakistan unitedstates farmers lost an opportunity to gain a new foreign market and no grain moved on unitedstates ships on the surface it may seem reasonable even patriotic to require a portion of food exports which are financed with unitedstates dollars to be hauled on unitedstates ships however when we lose foreign sales when cargo preference interferes with our ability to enter new markets and when the maritime industry itself gains nothing then cargo preference requirements should either be waived or eliminated entirely under certain circumstances cargo preference requirements can be waived such as the nonavailability of ships at reasonable rates however there is currently no waiver available under our cargo preference laws that would allow marad or the department of transportation to shift the cargo preference requirement from a private sector foreign purchase of grain to a government subsidized sale to the same country this congress should seriously consider legislation that would create a spcific waiver or transfer of cargo preference requirements when that waiver or transfer would facilitate initial sales of unitedstates commodities to new foreign markets i can assure you that this member of congress and others who represent agricultural constituencies will be vigilant in opposing any further expansion of cargo preference requirements and in modifying particularly unreasonable provisions of existing law relating to cargo

years past the white paper issued by president coolidge secretary of state prank kellogg in which he gives as a reason and rationalizes the sending of the marines in 1929 into nicaragua in hot pursuit of sandino himself though they never caught him and then occupying that country for 13 years making sure that we installed the militia known as the guardia civil that we installed the somoza

on what may be the most significant federal health insurance bill since the enactment of the medicare program in 1965 it contains the first major expansion of medicare benefits for the elderly since the program was enacted in terms of increased costs and beneficiaries it is at least equal to if not larger than the bills in the 1970s that extended medicare to the disabled and those with chronic kidney disease the bill makes major and long overdue improvements in the hospital and physician coverage provided under the medicare program it improves medicare by creating a basic hospital and physician benefit that is more consistent with the medical needs of the elderly and disabled beneficiaries and by changing an exceedingly complicated basic benefit to one that the beneficiaries can more readily understand i want to explain the bill that is before the house today by telling the members a little about its development in february president reagan announced his support for a bill proposed by secretary bowen that placed a limit of 2 000 on outofpocket costs for medicare covered hospital and physician charges for several weeks preceding the presidents endorsement this proposal had been the subject of a fierce debate within the administration with most of the presidents advisers and cabinet officers opposing any expansion of medicare after the presidents bill was introduced it was criticized by members of congress and outside groups on grounds that the limits on hospital and physician costs were too high and for not covering prescription drugs longterm care and a variety of other benefits some argued that because of these deficiencies it was inappropriate to label the bill catastrophic health insurance whether or not it did enough the proposal did expand medicare benefits it increased medicare costs by an estimated 3 4 billion in 1992 with 1 6 million elderly and disabled individuals benefiting from the expanded benefits a major problem with the presidents proposal was that it financed the benefit expansion by increasing the current medicare part b premium this is a monthly premium currently 17 90 per month paid by all part b enrollees except the very poorest who qualify for medicaid the presidents bill would increase this premium by 8 70 per month in 1992 or 104 40 per year while this increase might be acceptable to the betteroff medicare recipients it would add a significant financial burden to the lowincome elderly and disabled in fact some of the same lowincome elderly who currently cannot afford private medigap pollcies would not opt for the new coverage contained in the presidents bill because they could not afford the additional premium the presidents interest in the issue and endorsement of the bowen proposal provided congress with the unexpected opportunity to make long overdue improvements in the medicare program improvements that a few months earlier virtually no one would have thought possible shortly after the president announced his plan a number of similar medicare catastrophic health insurance bills were developed and introduced in the house and senate my colleagues mr stark and mr gradison the chairman and ranking republican of the ways and means health subcommittee developed legislation for the subcommittees consideration this legislation as reported by the full committee on ways and means on may 19 1987 lowers the limits on outofpocket covered hospital costs to 580 per year in 1989 and outofpocket physician costs to 1 043 per year medicare costs would be increased by 7 4 billion in 1992 and 3 5 million elderly and disabled people would be helped by this expansion of benefits while similar in structure the committee bill costs twice as much and helps two times as many individuals as the presidents proposal in addition to substantially increasing the benefits provided under the presidents proposal the ways and means bill contains a new progressive financing mechanism instead of financing the benefits by increasing the part b premium which is the same amount for all recipients rich or poor the committee developed an incomerelated premium that is paid through the income tax system in 1988 those who do not owe federal taxes and have adjusted gross income of under 6 000 will pay no premium which includes about 60 percent of all medicare beneficiaries the premium will gradually increase for those with adjusted gross income above this level until it reaches a maximum of 580 in throughout the subcommittee and full committee process our objective was to improve the presidents bill to the extent possible we wanted a better bill but we also wanted a bill that republican members would support and the president would sign this meant we could not do everything we did not want to repeat the past where we reached for too much and ended up with nothing the bill reported by ways and means was referred to energy and commerce on june 17 1987 they reported the bill with several changes including coverage for prescription drugs with a 500 per year deductible and no cost sharing this new medicare benefit was financed by an increase in the part b premium shortly after this ways and means approved an amendment that would cover prescription drugs with an 800 deducti the key medicare benefit expanble and a 20percent coinsurance after sions contained in this bill include the deductible had been met the drug a limit on outofpocket spending for benefit was financed 75 percent by an covered hospital stays to one hospital increase in the part b premium and 25 deductible per year which is 580 in percent through an increase in the 1989 income related premium developed for a cap on covered physician and outthe basic catastrophic coverage it was patient services expenses of 1 043 in estimated that the energy and coin 1989 merce committee prescription drug payment for outpatient prescription provision would cost 2 6 billion in drugs after a 500 deductible had been 1992 and cover 3 million people and met with 20percent coinsurance that the ways and means amendment i will ask the health subcommittee would cost 1 4 billion in 1992 with 1 5 chairman mr stark to explain in million potential beneficiaries more detail the need for and specific the house democratic leadership provisions of this bill asked ways and means and energy as i stated at the beginning this is a and commerce to attempt to work out bill of major significance it adds new the differences between the two bills benefits and substantially expands exso that we could go to the rules com isting hospital and physician coverage mittee with a unified position on what under the medicare program it is a should be made in order for house under medicare progrm t is a consideration under the rule in order major medicare improvement bill that to understand where we were at this congress should pass and that i hope point remember that the presidents the president will sign proposal was estimated to cost 3 4 bil i reserve the balance lion in 1992 the ways and means ap of my time proved bill with the drug amendment 0 1200 cost 9 8 billion the energy and commerce reported bill cost 11 8 billion mr duncan i yield at a meeting called by the speaker myself such time as i may consume attended by the chairmen of the two i rise in support of committees and their respective sub the substitute for h r 2470 committees plus chairman pepper i was gratified when and chairman roybal a package was president reagan placed catastrophic developed containing provisions from health insurance on the national both bills not everyone was totally agenda in my view the plan develhappy with this package frankly i oped for the president by secretary am concerned about the potential cost bowen of health and human services of the new prescription drug benefit was a reasonable response to the needs because of cost and the controversy of the elderly the bowen plan does over key features of this new benefit i not take care of all the potential fipreferred that the prescription drug nancial risks faced by medicare benefiprovision be considered by the house ciaries but it goes as far as i thought it as a separate amendment also i have should with respect to total program concerns about paying for respite care cost which is basically a social service unfortunately from my point of under the medicare program i think view the ways and means and energy that both of these new medicare bene and commerce committees went fits increase the likelihood that the much further than secretary bowen president will veto the bill obviously those committees brought the cost of there are those who disagree with me the plan from 12 billion over 5 years on these matters to 30 billion plus this new price tag in the spirit of unity i introduced a concerns me bill h r 2941 along with chairman the expansion of secretary bowens dingell containing the package of original concept is due to the more ways and means and energy and generous catastrophic limits set by the commerce provisions that had been committees and a multitude of noncadeveloped under the rule that has tastrophic addon benefits been adopted the provisions of this the addons go beyond the concept bill have been substituted for the pro of catastrophic coverage visions of h r 2470 as reported by the enough is enough if we keep on this two committees in other words it is path we are likely to derail the whole the package developed at the direction catastrophic coverage effort by invitof the house leadership that is before ing a presidential veto the house today since i have been in congress we the estimated cost of this package have been trying to pass catastrophic in 1992 is 10 billion for the medicare health coverage it always runs into benefits plus a net increase of 110 trouble when wellintentioned new million in medicaid costs at least 5 5 benefits and requirements make it too million of our nations elderly and dis expensive abled will benefit from the expanded it will be argued today that these benefits to pay for these benefits an new benefits are fiscally acceptable beincomerelated supplemental premium cause the elderly bear the cost and a higher part b premium will be through increased premiums well assessed medicare beneficiaries the you know as well as i do that as the level of these premiums has been set benefits get more expensive the elderso that the bill is budget neutral ly groups will come to congress seeking a cut in premiums and in the end the taxpayers will have to pay more or the congress will have to regulate the providers and cut payments even further to contain the new federal expenditures this is always what happens when the congress gets too freehanded with a good thing and passes the dinner check on to the next generation of taxpayers this is why i have chosen to support the substitute to h r 2470 being considered today it has a reasonable price tag and is closest to the original proposal set forth by the president i look to my colleagues to bring some levelheadedness to this process and join me in supporting this alternative to h r 2470 before the catastrophic health insurance train runs off the track i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00010558962821960449, 0.4998944103717804, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i am a little disappointed that the gentleman from new york mr rangeli had such a partisan statement to make on this issue after so many days of debating this issue in a bipartisan fashion quite frankly this bill is filed with joint efforts filled with efforts by democrats and republicans this member merely pointed out earlier that the threeuser accountability provisions did originate in the house republican task force and it was supported by vice president george bush and by the administration i am not going to get into the administrations position because i do not think drugs should be a partisan issue we have not allowed it to be up to this point and even though we have a presidential debate going on it should not be now what we should be concentrating on is the issue at hand and the issue at hand is how do we most effectively as a body create the kind of deterrence or incentives or disincentives that will yield the result of the reduction of the demand side for drugs in this country to win the war on drugs for several days now we have been over the question of how we should fight this war no one thing does it certainly what the gentleman is talking about and what i am talking about whichever provision comes to pass the anderson amendment or the mccollum amendment is that we will have a little better tool a new tool but it will not alone win the war we need the efforts in eradication we need the efforts on interdiction to stop drugs from coming into this country we need the assistance of local law enforcement and we need tough criminal laws including the death penalty we adopted a week or so ago we also very badly need to attack this demand side with education with rehabilitation and with user accountability this concept that is in the proposal that i have offered here today has been embraced by the gentleman from california in his amendment however i do not think unfortunately that this will work at all if it is adopted and that is the bad part of this this concept is just one other stage i would like to point out that the attorney general of new jersey where this concept did originate where they did adopt the provision of revoking the drivers license of anyone convicted of possession had comments about this because he is concerned about the young people in his comments to us earlier he said this in his testimony we are convinced that this form of mandatory punishment will be especially effective with respect to young people for whom the loss of driving privileges would be viewed as an especially significant and unpleasant sanction indeed as we may all recall from our own personal experiences a drivers license is one of the most precious commodities which an adolescent can own it is a privilege which young people look forward to with great anticipation by mandating the loss of driving privileges upon conviction of any drug offense including the simple possession of even a single marijuana cigarette we hope to provide students with one additional argument one additional rationalization to resist peer pressure and to resist the temptation to use drugs the problem with the substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from california is that it does gut my effort there is not going to be and there is no reason why we should expect there to be significant moneys appropriated to new grant program when we cannot even get a third of what we have had authorized for existing grant programs in this present congress why should we expect to see a new grant program on top of the 250 or 500 million we already have in this bill why should we expect to see that funded there is going to be no incentive for the states to come forward and enact these laws revoking driving privileges if the anderson substitute is adopted so i strongly urge my colleagues to use the stick in this case and do the same thing we did with the 21yearold drinking age there is no difference at all all the other arguments are bogus most members overwhelmingly voted to use the highways trust fund stick on the question of the 21yearold driving and drinking age let us use that today on the drug question"], [0.00011751055717468262,

that the policy did not fail but mistakes were made in its implementation i would argue that the policy has failed because it was born with original sin a flaw in design a mistake in the blueprint it was first a policy to interdict arms flowing from nicaragua then it became a means to pressure the sandinistas into crying uncle and come to the negotiating table but here is the flaw in conception the policy was advocated by the same people who have themselves refused to negotiate with the sandinistas and has been carried out by people who want to overthrow the nicaraguan government the contras certainly are not talking negotiations they want to lead an army into managua the president says that he does not seek the overthrow of the sandinista government he wants to negotiate their suicide the tower report makes clear that while we were given assurances of a renewed effort at a diplomatic solution a secret war was directed out of the basement of the white house we have armed an insurgent force called them the equivalent of our founding fathers solicited private funds on their behalf and broken our own laws to keep the war going the result has been not only a failure in nicaragua but severe damage to our credibility in the conduct of all our foreign relations one could argue that along the way we lost the support of the american peoplebut we would have to prove that we had their support for this war in the first place the moratorium on aid we call for today is a commonsense approach it is time to rein in the freelancers the arms brokers and the soldiers of fortune our efforts will end the era of the privatization of foreign policy it will allow us to take stock of ourselves and our policy that offers little hope for the people of nicaragua and of central america at the same time our efforts here signal the call for a new approach there are few illusions about the marxist character of the nicaraguan revolution the question is are we strong enough to negotiate our differences is there a conflict too great that the entire resources of the united states cannot be mustered to find a diplomatic solution i the united states has much more in common with the nicaraguan people than the nicaraguan people have in common with the soviet union isnt it common sense to drive this point home as the best way to be tough on communism again and again we are told that the nicaraguans have great admiration and affection for the american people it is just our official policy that they hate their ability to make this distinction is a source of strength for any new effort at forging better relations with nicaragua nicaragua need not be another cuba a second building block of our new approach to nicaragua is the peace plan offered by president arias of costa rica for the first time a document has been generated by the principals themselves designed to protect their own sovereignty and their security it merits our attention and our

of this i am not accusing members of doing that sort of thing but there are an awful lot of press releases that go out that say i voted to cut 70 million out of the appropriation bill it makes no difference about the merits they say all the big spenders were there to add the money to the appropriation bill it makes no difference that you are under the budget i spent 6 years on that budget committee and for the last 2 years i was there we have gone over it in detail we went back not to get billions of dollars but to get a few million here and a few million there to save udag and rea and medicare and all these other things if you brought them in here you would not have enough votes in this house to cut them the president sent up a budget that would have devastated some of these programs and got 27 votes we have a budget and we will get our 302 allocation and we will be under it our members have done a good job and we have come in under budget then here on the floor someone says that is not enough why not 10 percent less or 5 percent ninetenths of 1 percent is a little bit ludicrous to come in and offer that kind of cut on this budget when we have had hell to pay for 3 years i have visited these bases and we are not wasting money we have got experiments going on where the soldiers and the folks do things themselves and the air force people come in on weekends and they work to rebuild their barracks they do the work themselves and save tax money on contracting so i take it as an offense to this committee to come in and suggest that the members would cut even further when we have done a magnificant job had we known we were going to be cut 1 or 2 percent we could have easily added the money and accepted the amendment we can defend every dime that is in this budget and i would urge the members to reject this ninetenths of 1 percent cut"]]}
