said they arent going to take this up so then the question arises why are we doing this why arent we doing something that is more urgent and more pressing like passing a department of homeland security appropriations bill and lets be clear about what the problem is there is a bipartisan bill that democrats and republicans agree on on funding the department of homeland security what some of the more extreme elements in the house of representatives on the republican side have done is they have loaded it up with all kinds of antiimmigration provisions they have decided that that is where they want the debate on immigration so all of a sudden this bill has been loaded up with extraneous issues that dont belong on this bill quite frankly we think that that is wrong and democrats in the

sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing us those problems theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people theyre sending us not the right people its coming from more than mexico its coming from all over south and latin america and its coming probably from the middle east while much of what donald trump says is hilarious intentionally or otherwise baldfaced racism for political gain isnt funny his statements should disqualify him from being able to take the stage in any entertainment venue and speak to the american people as if what he said was no big deal it is not that i dont get the jokei havent been kidnapped by the politically correct policebut when public figures cross certain lines they should lose their privileges to host tv shows at least until they have apologized for their unacceptable behavior to put donald trump on the air in americas living rooms on the signature comedy show of one of the most important national networks after saying that mexicans are rapists drug dealers and criminals that is a corporate blunder too big to be ignored what happened nbc and comcast within a couple of weeks after trump launched those racist bombs you dumped trump you dumped his tv show on your network you dumped his pageants and other ventures on nbc and universal networks like telemundo in july nbc said due to the recent derogatory statements by donald trump regarding immigrants nbcuniversal is ending its business relationship with mr trump nbc said respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values nbc you were not alone in dumping trump macys department stores dumped trumps clothing line serta dumped trumps mattresses chef jose andres pulled his new restaurant from a trump hotel and univision dumped a trump pageant even nascar and espn dumped trump corporate america stepped up to the plate and dumped trump and we all applauded lets be clear the goodwill that corporate america earned from dumping trump didnt just come from the mexicanamerican community no when trump says mexicans are murderers rapists and drug dealers puerto rico knows he is talking about us too and colombians and salvadorans and pretty much everyone in the latino community look americans arent very good at telling us apart so when we are under attack by a tycoon running for the republican presidential nomination we cant tell us apart either we are all family what happened comcast universal and nbc now 3 months later have donald trumps words been expunged did i miss an apology on one of his almost nightly television appearances has he confessed his racist and hateful call to action well nbc installing trump as snl host may be good for ratings but it is a bigger deal than a cameo or being a guest on the tonight show i am calling you out if donald trump had said gays and lesbians were murderers and raping americans would he get to host a show it is every bit as much a fiction and a lie donald trump has said some pretty awful things about women individually and collectively but what if he said most women were criminals would the writers be thinking up sketches for trump if he had slandered an entire gender rather than an entire ethnic group trump says he wants to do away with the part of the constitution that allowed freed slaves freed african american slaves to be treated fully as american citizens yes trump thinks we do not need the 14th amendment to the constitution but what if he said that black people were murderers rapists drug dealers would you still pitch skits with donald trump and some lighthearted banter what if all the latino cast members all walked off the job at saturday night live oh wait you dont have any latino cast members i do seem to remember comcast spending a lot of time on capitol hill when they had a merger deal with time warner and they wanted support from members of congress comcast said latinos were so important to them and they had plans to do this and that and the other thing to support the latino and immigrant community what happened the merger didnt go through so you

point blank told me that she is a recovering addict tracy started smoking marijuana when she was 15 to numb the pain from past sexual abuse not otherwise knowing how to cope in a healthy way she moved from toledo to chillicothe ohio in 2001 where she met a man who introduced her to opioid pills and cocaine at age 24 she started using cocaine and it wasnt long before she used it every day eventually she started to smoke it and even inject for 6 years her addiction was so bad she lost everything jobs friends family everything she owned even her dignity and morals she was alone fighting the worst battle of her life in 2007 she was caught with possession of cocaine after reoffending shortly after she was sent to prison rather than give tracy any chance to seek treatment she was sent to prison for 5 years in prison she realized there were just as many drugs in prison as on the street being there did not help she needed treatment not a prison sentence it is nearly impossible to find a treatment facility because there are so few available from the age of 15 until may 4 2007 tracy abused drugs what drove her to sobriety she was so tired of losing everything living couch to couch doing illegal things to get drugs and having her dignity and morals stripped away because she was chasing a high she was ready for a change to take back the life she lost during her addiction today her life has changed dramatically a week ago on may 4th she celebrated 9 years of sobriety now she uses her experience of moving past addiction to help others she is in college studying psychology to become a substance abuse counselor she started a job at a recovery house as a resident advisor and is also an active member of team recovery the legislative action the house will address this week will provide much needed correction to our justice and health systemswhich have not adapted fast enough to this crisis i wish to emphasize a few lessons team recovery highlighted to me these are the recommendations of individuals who understand the plight of heroin and opioid addiction better than most 1 there needs to be more funding for detox beds they should not be limited to 16 beds per facility 2 medicaid should not cap facilities to 16 detox beds 3 prevention education and awareness are paramount the innovative approach of team recoverys school presentations allows students to better relate impacting their understanding and behavior 4 better monitoring of prescription prescribing and overprescribing is needed creating stricter limitations on prescription counts is highly

violence against women whether in times of conflict or disaster too often we see the worst battles fought on women and girls bodies tonight i am honored to recognize one woman who has survived unspeakable violence she is a survivor at 87 years old she traveled all the way from south korea her name is lee yongsoo known to everyone as grandmother lee she has become the voice of justice peace and reconciliation in 1944 16yearold yongsoo lee of tasegu korea was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older japanese man the man took the two of them and three other teenaged girls by train then ship to taiwan there the girls were forced into sexual slavery serving four to five japanese soldiers every day for a year ms lee suffered beatings and torture was infected with venereal disease was fed paltry amounts faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body and was never allowed outside only the end of world war ii brought her relief ms lee is just one example of the over 200 000 women from korea china the philippines burma thailand vietnam malaysia taiwan indonesia and east timor who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the japanese imperial army during world war ii these socalled comfort women suffered serious physical emotional and psychological damages as a result of their ordeal of her 200 000 sisters grandmother lee is but one out of a handful of survivors across asia pacific still alive former secretary of state hillary clinton was right when she reportedly called these victims rather than comfort women sex slaves when japanese prime minister shinzo abe addresses a joint meeting of congress next week on april 29 he has the opportunity to do right by these women he can make a full unequivocal and formal apology on behalf of the japanese government the prime ministers visit is indeed a historic one he will be the first japanese prime minister to address a joint meeting of congress he will address this institution on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii and the 50th anniversary of the normalization between korea and japan prime minister abe will address this hallowed chamber where president roosevelt delivered an address to our body as america entered war there is much to be expected and anticipated in next weeks address according to yesterdays editorial by the new york times the success of prime minister abes visit depends on whether and how honestly mr abe confronts japans wartime history including its decision to wage war its brutal occupation of china and korea its atrocities and its enslavement of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves or comfort women in wartime brothels in 2007 the house of representatives sent a profound message to the government of japan by passing h res 121 which i authored the resolution stated that it is the sense of the house of representatives that the government of japan 1 should formally acknowledge apologize and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces coercion of young women into sexual slavery known to the world as comfort women during its colonial and wartime occupation of asia and the pacific islands from the 1930s through the duration of world war ii 2 would help to resolve recurring questions about the sincerity and status of prior statements if the prime minister of japan were to make such an apology as a public statement in his official capacity 3 should clearly and publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women for the japanese imperial armed forces never occurred and 4 should educate current and future generations about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the comfort women and yet the japanese government has continued to fail to address this resolution to be fair the government of japan has made important and appreciated efforts to face its history in 1993 chief cabinet secretary yohei kono issued a statement saying the japanese military was involved in establishing the comfort stations he said the womengirls really from korea and elsewhere had been recruited against their own will this was based upon many documents in 1995 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of world war ii then prime minister tomiichi murayama admitted japans colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries particularly to those of asian nations in the hope that no such mistake be made in the future i regard in a spirit of humility these irrefutable facts of history and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology yet in 2006 during abes first term as prime minister he unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he undermined the 1993 kono statement incorrectly alleging that no documentary evidence existed of japans complicity in setting up and running the comfort women stations there was in fact plenty of evidence including the extensive personal testimonies of the survivors who spoke of being raped 10 20 up to 50 times per day in addition many international bodies have issued recommendations and conclusions on japans history and actions in 2003 the u n committee that evaluates japans compliance with the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment expressed concern regarding inadequate remedies for the victims of sexual slavery and violence particularly survivors of japans military sexual slavery practice during world war ii this committee also recommended that japan provide education to address the discriminatory roots of sexual and genderbased violence violations and provide rehabilitation measures to the victims in 2008 the committee that accesses japans implementation of the international covenant on civil and political rights concluded that japan should accept legal responsibility and apologize unreservedly for the comfort women system and take immediate and effective legislative and administrative measures to adequately compensate all survivors educate students and the general public about the issue and to refute and sanction any attempts to defame the victims or deny the events talking about educating students the books the textbooks in japan still do not address the history of the military action in asia during world war ii following the passage of h res 121 many countries followed suit and passed their own resolutions taiwan canada netherlands the european union and south korea there is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like japan to apologize for its past mistakes a government is a living breathing organism that is responsible for its past present and its future yet as the new york times editorial said history should have been settled that it is not settled is largely the fault of mr abe and his rightwing political allies who keep questioning history and even trying to rewrite it last year i along with 17 of my house colleagues wrote to the ambassador of japan to the unitedstates calling the timing and context of the japanese government report on the kono statement regrettable unfortunate unacceptable and destabilizing also last year the abe administration tried and then failed to get the united nations to partially retract the authoritative 1996 report which called on japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to the survivors who had been forced into sex slavery during the war most notably this year the japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in a history textbook about the comfort women during world war ii i believe the budget of japan prime minister abe was able to secure almost half a billion dollars to effect that kind of change wherever they deemed necessary now some say that japan has apologized enough and it is time to move on to those people i would say given these continued revisionist attempts for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation the government of japan takes two steps backwards enough is enough seventy years later it is time for prime minister abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology something that carries the weight of his government the german chancellor angela merkel has urged prime minister abe to face japans history germany knows something about this after world war ii it engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal in 1970 on a cold and wet day in warsaw thengerman chancellor willy brandt laid down a wreath at the memorial of the jewish ghetto then he fell to his knees in front of the memorial as a reporter who witnessed this event wrote later if this man who wasnt responsible for the crime who wasnt there in those years now decides to walk through the former warsaw ghetto and to kneel downthen its clear he doesnt kneel there for his own sake he confesses a guilt that he doesnt have to carry and he asks for a forgiveness that he himself doesnt need then he kneels there for germany and so 70 years later grandmother lee and the hundreds of thousands of souls of the departed continue to wait for their justice and peace as someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant i know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts in 1942 during world war ii my country my government put aside the constitutional rights of japanese americans and systematically incarcerated thousands of us120 000 we were unitedstates citizens but we also looked like the enemy decades later we the japanese american community fought for an apology from our own government in 1988 congress passed and president ronald reagan signed into law h r 442 the civil liberties act of 1988 this was a formal apology to united states citizens of japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during world war ii our government made a mistake but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result even though 40 years have passed it still warmed my heart to hear my government say were sorry japan must now do the same they must show the maturity of a democratic country apologize for their mistake and thereby gain the trust of their sister asian nations violence against women continues today according to the world health organization women aged 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than cancer car accidents war and malaria

reported being raped during the 1994 genocide and 72 percent said they knew someone who had been raped an estimated 23 000 to 46 000 kosovar albanian women are believed to have been raped between august 1998 and august 1999 the height of the conflict with serbia in 2003 74 percent of a random sample of 399 liberian refugee women living in camps in sierra leone reported being sexually abused prior to being displaced from their homes in liberia fiftyfive percent of them experienced sexual violence during displacement even today the u n labeled the democratic republic of congo as the rape

human rights watch report the extremist group isil has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against yazidi women and girls in northern iraq isis forces took several thousand yazidi civilians into custody in northern iraqs province in august 2014 according to kurdistan officials and community leaders witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and girls from

the asia pacific each year this number declines the survivors are dying by the day they deserve the justice that has been due to them for the past 70 years they deserve the justice that has been denied them these women want and deserve an official apology in 1991 with the swift courage of kim haksun she brought to light her story of being a sex slave to the japanese imperial army her story

30 minutes for debate this legislation as he indicated provides 3 48 billion for the house of representatives and joint operations of congress that is a 73 million increase over the current years levels but more than 150 million below the presidents request this legislation funds the salaries and expenses for the house of representatives the capitol police the congressional budget office the architect of the capitol government accountability office and the library of congress today is june 9 nearly 2 months have passed since my friends in the majority sailed past the statutory deadline for passing a budget without even looking back nearly 1 month has passed since house republicans began considering appropriations bills without first agreeing to topline spending levels republicans made passing a budget a top priority this year they insisted that we would return to regular order i really wish the american public understood the regular order concept yet here we are working without a roadmap and instead passing new rules to stifle debate on the house floor on controversial issues like equal rights but i will get to that in a bit for now i will just say it is disappointing because instead of considering appropriations bills funding critical investments for american families and communities the house majority has again chosen to take care of itself the partisan mishmash we are discussing today is no different here is an example this legislation forces the library of congress to continue to use the pejorative term illegal alien in its subject headings in another life as a member of the judiciary i refused to use that term when discussing persons that were before me i cant help but laugh at the absurdity of this weand i mean congresscant have a conversation about comprehensive immigration reform yet we are forcing the library of congress to readopt politically charged rhetoric for what how is this a priority the legislative branch appropriations bill is certainly not the appropriate place for a political debate on immigration this legislation continues to fund the energy and commerce select panel to target planned parenthood which thus far has conducted a completely partisan political witch hunt and come up empty this legislation continues to fund the select committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attack in benghazi which has already spent 7 million on just four hearings over the past 2 years in order to smear secretary clinton and what has it produced nothing i will note that the select committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attack in benghazi has overlapped a number of previous investigations that also found nothing you want to cut wasteful spending mr speaker look no further defund the benghazi hearings i am happy to say that the bill provides 563 million for members representational allowances for the coming fiscal year this is 1 5 percent increase over the current level but when we consider the fact that the mras have been cut by nearly 17 percent since 2011that adds up to 312 000a mere 1 5 percent increase is clearly inadequate i can make the argument that because of that we are unable to pay young people that come here and keep them with their institutional memory and in addition we are unable to provide efficient services for our constituents yet we cut that 312 000 out of the budget and now we are going to add back a little bit and claim that we are being efficient i wont even go into the salary and the costofliving adjustment but to say that people find it surprising that we are entering this legislation in 2017 year 9 without a costofliving increase for members of congress i wonder if that is causing some of them to live in their offices i wonder if it is causing them to breach tax considerations when they do that and perhaps even ethical considerations but i wont go into that furthermore an amendment has been offered that will require a 1 percent cut across the board to the bills spending levels such a cut would essentially wipe out this already diminutive increase members should vote this amendment down with salaries frozen where they are i just got through saying we cant retain the best talent we continue to lose staff i have three staffers that were perfect for their jobs that had to leave because they couldnt afford to live on the salary that we were paying them side note here mr speaker the median rent for a onebedroom apartment in washington d c was 2 160 per month last december and i will remind the members of this body that many staffers start here at 30 000 or less annually do the math we need to take better care of our people before i yield back i feel compelled to mention speaker ryans new rules governing the appropriations process on the house floor three weeks ago something particularly shameful took place in this room as we debated the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act an amendment by our colleague and friend sean patrick maloney reached the vote threshold needed to pass republican leadership apparently caught off guard held open the vote for nearly 8 minutes in order to make republican members change their vote they allowed this to happen in the back of the room and the amendment failed and what contentious subject was the amendment focused on i will tell you prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against lgbtq employees this episode demonstrated just how little courage some members of the republican party have a week later representative sean patrick maloney offered his amendment again this time to the energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act and it caused such a hubbub that the legislation collapsed on the floor i will say that again a provision ensuring that lgbtq contractors cant be fired solely because they are lgbtq proved so contentious to republicans that they defeated their own appropriations billi might add a good billto prevent it from taking effect as a result beginning this month house republican leadership is closing down the process and requiring all members to submit amendments for appropriations measures to the rules committee in advance and has announced regular order is being suspended in order to make sure republicans arent caught off guard by embarrassing amendments for instance ensuring basic civil rights to american citizens remember speaker ryans pledge to return to regular order where is that commitment now perhaps my friends should consider that the reason these amendments are embarrassing to them is because their position is in and of itself embarrassing i will note that representative sean patrick maloney offered his amendment again for the current legislation but this time republicans wont even allow it on the floor for a vote so mr maloney offer it again and again so we can continue to point out how ridiculous this is

in the carter administration that allowed us to be able to go in and then access this natural gas that is there the same concept as what you were talking about is putting the money into the renewables driving the costs down having the tax credits in place over a longterm period so that we can bring the costs down and incentivize some investments at the end of the day that is how you move forward with creating new sectors of the economy i see the gentleman from georgia and i thought he was just hanging on every word i was saying here and you were so enthralled and yet you were here to file a

agencies share information on potential child sex offenders with foreign law enforcement agencies i am opposed to how one particular provision added in the senate amendment before us today would work in practice other existing provisions of the bill already contain the following informationsharing requirements with and among law enforcement agencies here in the united states and abroad unitedstates sex offenders are required to provide international travelrelated information to the sex offender registries the department of homeland security is required to create the angel watch center to receive information on individuals seeking to enter the unitedstates who have committed offenses of a sexual nature as well as registered sex offenders seeking to travel outside the unitedstates in order to share all relevant information to federal state and local law enforcement officials the unitedstates marshals service is required to notify law enforcement agencies of sex offenders seeking to leave the united states who have not transmitted their travel information to sex offender registries the unitedstates marshals service is required to notify the international destination country of a sex offenders upcoming travel and the secretary of state should seek reciprocal international agreements or arrangements to further these goals if our goal is to ensure that customs and border as well as law enforcement officials are notified so that they may track and investigate those sex offenders who may be engaging in sex tourism or pose a threat of absconding these provisions have addressed those concerns as a result i am skeptical of what more we stand to gain by the senate amendments provision authorizing the secretary of state to use a unique passport identifier for covered sex offenders that is defined as any visual designation affixed to a conspicuous location on the passport indicating the individual is a covered sex offender at best if this vague language is meant to describe some sort of code or symbol embedded in the passport that is only discernible by law enforcement at the border indicating that the traveler is a sex offender it is redundant given the other informationsharing mandated by the bills other provisions however if this is interpreted to mean something akin to the words sex offender stamped on the identification page of the passport this raises serious problems and will lead to unintended consequences first it is simply bad policy to single out one category of offenses for this type of treatment we do not subject those who murder who defraud the government or our fellow citizens of millions and billions or who commit acts of terrorism to these restrictions second by treating all sexual offenders as one monolithic group ignores reality while some pose a continued and real risk of reoffending and may be traveling to engage in sex tourism or other illicit acts not all pose the same risk indeed the failure of this provision to allow for the individualized consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the travelers criminal history including how much time has elapsed since his last offense underscores how this provision is overbroad details such as whether the traveler is a serial child rapist versus someone with a decadesold conviction from when he was 19yearsold and his girlfriend was 14 just missing the romeo and juliet exception by one year are significant and would allow law enforcement to more appropriately prioritize their finite resources third a traveler does not have any recourse with the foreign destination country if he or she is refused entry solely on the basis of this unique passport identifier while the bill has some due process provisions those apply only domestically there is no recourse if a traveler is erroneously denied entry from the destination country fourth if the unique passport identifier is implemented in a way that makes it obvious to not only law enforcement officials but any member of the general public viewing the passport this could lead to unintended consequences of persecution and harm to the traveler this is especially troubling given that no factual context about the offense is provided if our goal is to ensure that domestic and foreign law enforcement and customs officials are notified of potential threats multiple existing provisions of the bill already achieve that goal without raising these problematic implementation and fairness concerns in summary while i support the underlying goal of ensuring that american law enforcement agencies share information on potential child sex offenders with foreign law enforcement agencies i have grave concerns about how the redundant and problematic provision regarding the unique passport identifier added as a senate amendment would work in practice therefore i urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying bill"], [0.00021857023239135742,

needed to fill those jobs according to a recent study by careerbuilder nearly 50 percent of employers nationwide cannot find skilled workers to fill open positions many of these jobs are located in lucrative career fields like welding emergency medical response electrical engineering robotics and carpentry this gap between employers and our workers is holding our economy back it is exacerbating our unemployment problem it is hurting our communities and it is placing unneeded pressure on our families the american economy needs qualified workers with the skills and drive necessary to fill these open jobs i believe part of the answer to how we address this problem is career and technical education career and technical education or cte is simply education that specializes in the skilled trades applied sciences information technology and similar disciplines career and technical education occurs in schools across america in my home state of west virginia about 65 000 students each year participate in cte courses those who do are much more likely to succeed over 80 percent of west virginia participants meet industrydriven performance requirements for the technical skills they receive and 95 percent go on to additional postsecondary education the workforce or the military i hear about cte all the time as i travel across my district in west virginia and visit schools and community colleges i have seen the classrooms and the students whose eyes light up when they show off their work i have spoken to the faculty and administrators who have committed their careers to training up a next generation workforce and i know that just a little more support will make a huge difference while there is no silver bullet to our nations unemployment problem additional investment in cte is one way to help put people back to work and grow our economy the skills provided by cte are some of the most highly soughtafter skills in our economy today but ironically enough these are the hardest jobs to fill in the united states because of the lack of adequately trained individuals according to a recent study by the manufacturing institute over 2 million manufacturing jobs will go unfilled in the next decade because of the skills gap i believe we can help that is why i joined with seven of my colleagues to introduce h r 4263 the teach act also known as the technical education and career help act my bipartisan bill will invest in our cte programs by providing new resources for the technical education teachers without authorizing any new spending my bill will authorize the higher education acts teacher residency grant program to be used to help schools recruit and train highquality cte teachers this is currently not allowed my bill will increase the quality of training that students receive by recruiting midcareer professionals in relevant technical fields having teachers with real work experience in the fields that they teach will ensure students receive the best training i

of the department of energy the army corps of engineers the bureau of reclamation and other agencies under our jurisdiction this is 259 million more than last years funding level and is 168 million above the budget request this is a responsible bill that recognizes the importance of investing in this nations infrastructure and national defense as we do each year we work hard to incorporate priorities and perspectives from both sides of the aisle the administrations proposal to cut the programs of the army corps of engineers by 1 4 billion would have led to economic disruptions at our ports and waterways silted in and would have left our communities and businesses vulnerable to flooding instead this bill recognizes the critical work of the corps and provides 6 1 billion for those activities this includes 1 8 billion for flood and coastal storm damage reduction projects these projects prevented damages of 14 8 billion in 2014 alone harbor maintenance activities are funded at 1

it relates to the public health to establish a factually and scientifically sound foundation prior to taking any action that would impact consumers in our economy the bill before us today h r 1599 does just that by ensuring national uniformity regarding labeling of foods derived from genetically engineered plants by preventing a patchwork of conflicting state or local labeling laws which inherently interfere with interstate and foreign commerce genetic engineering in agriculture has occurred for centuries ingredients from genetically engineered plants have been a part of the unitedstates food supply for decades in fact as much as 90 percent of our corn sugar beet and soybean crops are now genetically engineered and more than 70 percent of processed foods contain ingredients derived from such crops the fda oversees the safety of all food products from plant sources including those from genetically engineered crops these products must meet the same safety requirements as foods from traditionally bred crops the fda currently has a consultation process in place in which developers of the underlying technologies address any outstanding safety or other regulatory issues with the agency prior to marketing their products the fda has completed approximately 100 of such consultations no products have gone to market until fda safetyrelated questions have been resolved fda officials have repeatedly stated that the agency has no basis for concluding that bioengineered foods are different from other foods in a meaningful way and the world health organization has confirmed that no effects on human health have been shown as a result of consumption of such foods in fact they can grow faster resist diseases and drought cost less and prove more
