2012 in the longstanding tradition of this committee the bill has been prepared on a bipartisan basis and i support the bill i know that chairman rogers will be glad to hear that i am happy to report that the bill provides the funds necessary to support our troops both at home and in the field it also makes the investment in research and development and acquisition needed to fully equip our troops and maintain our nations technological edge within the funds provided and after careful review the committee exercised its constitutional responsibility to allocate resources to those programs that best support the requirements of our military forces in writing this bill the committee had to make hard choices the allocation for this bill is 530 billion 9 billion below the request while this is 17 billion above the fiscal year 2011enacted level much of the increase is absorbed by the military pay operation and maintenance and the defense health program accounts the bill also provides the funds needed to support unitedstates service personnel examples of this include the military pay accounts fund at a 1 6 percent raise consistent with the budget request and the level included in the housepassed fiscal year 2012 armed services authorization bill the bill also provides 32 3 billion for the defense health program including 125 million above the request to continue the committees longstanding efforts to improve research and treatment of traumatic brain injury and psychological health conditions the bill also includes funding increases for several research efforts including peerreviewed breast cancer prostate cancer ovarian cancer and lung cancer research the bill fully funds 2 3 billion requested for family programs and adds funding for several initiatives including 250 million to replace schools owned by local education authorities and 40 million for impact aid the bill addresses many of dods most pressing investment needs it funds 10 ships as requested in the budget and 32 joint strike fighter aircraft i would like to have seen more strike fighter aircraft because i believe theyre doing a much better job on this program last year it was in some trouble this year admiral venlet has said repeatedly that theyre in fact ahead of the training schedule so i think this is very good news the bill also adds funding to fill gaps in dod capabilities some examples include the m1a2 system enhancement package 272 million is included to prevent a break in production of tanks and this is something that our committee agreed with on an overwhelming basis that shutting down the tank line in ohio would be a terrible mistake because wed lose the skilled workers and then were going to reopen this tank line in 2 or 3 years and it would just be a waste of money so we bridged that gap hmmwv force protection 50 million is added to develop and test and improve armor and other blast protection technologies on the hmmwv long range strike 100 million is added to reduce technical risk and schedule risks for this program were moving ahead on a replacement for the trident submarine the c17 replacement is included to replace the operational loss of a c17 aircraft the committee has steadfastly replacedwhen there have been operational losses weve replaced the equipment this is another example special operation command shortfalls this is one thing we had in our bill in 2011 and this year an increase of 250 million is added to address unfunded requirements identified by the special operations command national guard and reserve equipment 1 5 billion is included to fund equipment shortfalls in national guard and reserve equipment intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance 50 million is included above the request to continue to fill gaps in dod isr equipment israeli missile defense programs 130 million is added to enhance israeli missile defense programs including the arrow missile defense system small business innovative research 50 million is included to continue the committees efforts for sbir phase iii transition historically black colleges and universities 20 million is added to continue defense research at historically black colleges and universities energy efficiency improvements the bill includes 82 million above the request to field equipment that will reduce the energy footprint of deployed marine corps units the bill also includes 10 million above the request for pilot programs to improve dod energy efficiency the bill provides 118 7 billion for operations in afghanistan and iraq and for continuing the withdrawal of unitedstates forces from iraq the bill ensures that troops have essential force protection and provides the means for the afghans to provide their own security the bill includes 12 8 billion to train afghanistans national security forces while the bill provides essential support for our troops i remain concerned about our nations direction in pakistan and ongoing operations in afghanistan there is cause to question the reliability of our partnership with both countries in the light of recent events we must reassess the extent of unitedstates military involvement and the objectives of unitedstates foreign policy in that part of the world reexamining whether unitedstates national security requires a continued deployment of over 100 000 unitedstates service personnel i welcome president obamas decision to start the withdrawals and i also urge a ceasefire and a political settlement after a careful review of the security situation i believe it is time to significantly accelerate the withdrawal of unitedstates forces to accomplish this objective responsibly will take some care by necessity a political solution in afghanistan will involve negotiations with taliban representatives it will also demand taking into account the interests of surrounding nations to ensure that those neighbors do not fight with one another along sectarian or tribal divides within afghanistan finally we must guard against creating a vacuum similar to the one that occurred at the end of the soviet occupation in 1989 even with these cautions in mind i believe it is time to begin the process of bringing the level of deployed unitedstates troops in line with a new assessment of our security interests in the region i look forward to hearing from general petraeus and general odierno we worked with them on the surge in iraq which turned out to be very successful the military has done a very good job in helmand and kandahar and has dominated the taliban in recent times which is very positive we still have a problem on the eastern front between afghanistan and pakistan and we need to continue to put pressure on al qaeda though the capture and death of osama bin laden was something that all the troops that have served here since 2001 should take satisfaction in the person who led the effort against the united states in one of the most horrific acts and one of the most economic destabilizing acts that has ever occurred to our country while i have concerns about our nations policies in afghanistan and pakistan i strongly support this bill its a bipartisan bill and it provides the resources needed by our troops i urge your support for the bill i also want to thank the staff i know chairman young will join me in this we have a tremendous staff that works together they worked together when i was chairman theyre working together now that chairman young hashe had been chairman before and has now regained his chairmanship and the staff has done an extraordinary job its a major piece of work to put together a 530 billion bill and know all these programs and i commend them for their good work i reserve the balance of my time"],

to argue that the republican spending plan does two extremely harmful things it weakens our economy and fails to seriously reduce our debt democrats agree that cutting spending is part of the solution to our difficult problems that confront us but we also believe that cuts should be smart and targeted not reckless rather than cutting investments in growthat the same time our international competitors are ramping up theirsdemocrats support the make it in america agenda a plan to invest in innovation manufacturing jobs and middle class opportunity thats what the president talked about in his state of the union and he was right unfortunately the consensus that the republican spending plan will halt our economic recovery and cost jobs is widespread and nonpartisan fed chairman ben bernanke appointed by president bush tells us that the plan will cost a couple of hundred thousand jobs macroeconomic advisers tell us that the republican plan will wipe out approximately 450 000 jobs moodys analytics chief economist mark zandi who advised senator mccain in his presidential campaign tells us that it will cost up to 700 000 jobs the economic policy institute puts the number at 800 000 jobs whatever the precise number it is a large number of jobs that will be lost if we pass the republicans budget solutions what they want to do as the gentleman from washington state said this is all exempt this is security these are all mandatory expenditures this small slice of the budget about 460 billion the republicans want to cut by 22 percent give or take a percentage point so they are holding harmless almost all of 85 to 86 percent of the money that we spent and say were simply going to cut from education from health care from children from community developmentprojectsthe guts of what makes our communities have a better quality at the same time i have argued the republican spending plan barely puts a dent in our budget deficit its reasonable to ask how can this plan have such severe consequences for our economy yet so little impact on our fiscal predicament this chart helps us answer the question all of the proposed cuts all of the cuts come from this small slice of the budget the category of our budget called nonsecurity discretionary spending but nonsecurity discretionary spending the gentleman from washington state said 12 percent we have here 14 percent its in that neighborhood depending upon exactly what you include as security or nonsecurity when you attempt to find 100 billion in savings and when you insist on getting these savings from 14 percent of the budget you have to cut very deeply into absolutely essential projects and programs for our people you have to cut billions in funding into new medical cures and energy technologies you have to kick 200 000plus children off of head start you even have to cut port and transit security by twothirds hear that again theyre cutting port and transit security by twothirds while theyre holding terrorism hearings the chairman of the house homeland security committee a republican said those cuts were too dangerous as david brooks recently argued congress should never cut without an evaluation process but instead legislatorshe referred to the republican initiatives are simply cutting on the basis of whats politically easy and what vaguely seems expendable it may be possible to portray taking on 14 percent of the budget as fiscally responsible but only because doing so exploits americans misunderstanding of the budget a recent poll shows that 63 percent of americans think we spend more on defense and foreign aid than we do on medicare and social securityall the blue all the green and then the yellow that small sliverwhich by the way includes discretionary foreign policy expenditures i urge our citizens to look at the consequences of these cuts and look at the small sliver that the republicans are focusing themselves on and you and me on we need to see the whole picture if were going to come to grips with the challenge that confronts us when another poll asked americans how much we spend on foreign aid the average estimate was 27 percentwhen the right answer is about 1 percent it is entirely out of step with fiscal reality to attempt to tackle our deficit while ignoring 86 percent of the budget fiscal responsibility is not synonymous with cutting nonsecurity discretionary spending in truth fiscal responsibility is much more difficult than that as former republican congressman joe scarborough put it this week the belief of some on the right that america can balance the budget by cutting education infrastructure the corporation for public broadcasting and home heating assistance to the poor is tantamount to budgetary witchcraft we have to start doing more we have to address the defense spending that takes up more than a quarter of our budget we have to make hard choices that can keep our entitlements strong for generations to come and with tax revenues at a 60year low we have to pass deficitreducing tax reform unless were willing to take on that hard work on a bipartisan basis none of us deserve to call ourselves fiscally responsible"],

justice for the syrian people alongside of me were syrian americans whose families were in houla and homs and had seen the brutality we had projections of the violence against children and bodies wrapped in white cloth we cry out and wonder why there cannot be more done by the world where is the outrage i congratulate the secretary of state and the president of the united states and other

abortions meaning that we do not disagree that that is heinous and horrific i fear the prenda legislation because it is not thoughtful and has not been drafted in a way that distinguishes the rights of women in this nation to have choice and what it does is it criminalizes a doctor and criminalizes a relationship between a patient and a physician in this country we have the right of choice that choice is between a woman her god her faith her family and her physician and what you do in prenda is that you taint and stigmatize the relationship between the doctor and the patient because how do you get in the mindset and the psyche of a physician who is doing his job providing the care that the woman has askedher choiceand begin to demonize and suggest that she is forcibly deciding to abort because she is forcibly deciding what gender she wants then of course you add insult to injury by profiling various countries as my colleague has previously said why cant we look for more positive ways of providing womens rights and discerning or educating people that women are equally valuable as human beings as men but the prenda bill demonizes the patient physician relationship we cannot

and none of us would be here today and if it is unfair for us it must also be unfair for the workers of this country the republicans gave up that demand thanks to the democrats the rule providing for

and to specifically focus on his leadership along with my colleague from maryland who as we were developing the affordable care act worked so hard on some of these finite issues ensuring that we had the oversight over insurance rates we tried to do everything that we could to produce legislation that embraced the concept of medicare for example recognizing and respecting medicare and then broadening the concept to ensuring that all people had access to health care but isnt it interesting just a few months later we are standing in the well of the house and we are literally having to hang on to the commonsense program of medicare if i could i would like to frame the discussion in this manner you have articulated a very commonsense approach that in any debt ceilingby the way let me give my editorial comment i have voted for a clean debt ceiling just simply to pay americas bills unfortunately that didnt carry the weight of the day but what i will say is that the discussions that are being crafted in the media or at least have been perceived in the media that our republican friends want to provide to the american people is that we are broke is that we have no way of doing anything i want to be very clear i am aware that americans are out of work i am aware that we have had 6 months without a jobs bill and that democrats are trying to put one on the floor but i want everyone to know that we have had a significant recovery because of the american recovery and reinvestment act so we are moving forward except for the fact that we have got to get jobs we have had seven consecutive quarters where the gdp has grown so to make our seniors the brunt of what we have made up in terms of saying we have no money we cannot think any other way we have to hit someone who has paid their dues if you will is simply wrong and unfair as i have said we are not where we want to be but the sacrifices that democrats have made in the recovery and reinvestment act have put us forward in addition we have seen growth now we have a budget first of all we started off in 2011 with a budget a ryan budget that then suggested that we were so broke we had to voucher medicare frankly vouchering medicare is extinguishing medicare its eliminating medicare as we know it it is telling a senior that you need a dollars worth of health care we can give you a quarter we are going to give a senior who has invested in america who has worked all of his or her life who as my colleague has said maybe has fallen on difficult times with a 401 k and certainly that is because markets have gone up and markets have gone down and you are going to say now you are going to get a quarter now bring us forward that bill of course was passed by the house predominantly republican with any number of members who believe there is nothing wrong with that it has gone nowhere in the senate now we are at a crucial point where the president has asked for us all to be adults to sit around the table and talk about how can we work this together can we do it with the airplanes and jets can we let the bush tax cuts expire can we call upon our friends in the energy industry that is leaps and bounds in profits to craft or to understand a way that we can recraft those particular provisions to bring that money here into the federal government and i would say to my good friends in business where it might be the climate of the united states allows you to thrive you are doing better because you live in a democracy you live in a place where we respect property where we dont run into a corporation and say you know what i think i am going to take about you know half a trillion dollars from you if you have that much just send that check over to the united states treasury we dont do that so i want the point to be made tonight that we are on the side of the angels because it is absolutely ludicrous to not see the difference in life span pre1965 before lyndon baines johnson a fellow texan announced his desire in the great society to find a way to in essence respect the senior citizens the elderly and at that time he was probably looking at individuals in their 60s because of the wear and tear and the lack of health care to be able to give them an extra lifeline to say that he was right and to make sure i just want to add these points as i come to a close to be able to suggest that the millions of seniors who now have access to guaranteed benefits are in jeopardy because of the games that are being played about the debt ceiling a simple procedural vote if you will that allows the debt ceiling to be raised so that we can pay our bills something that we have done if i may put in the record some 74 times since 1962 with no quarrel whatsoever finally i would argue this many of those on medicare are families of veterans themselves obviously may have served even though i know that they have veterans benefits but they are people who are willing to sacrifice to build this country they are seniors for us to take away this lifeline is unspeakable and i hope that as democrats we will draw a few friends a few reasonable friends to know that there should be no tying of raising the debt ceiling to medicare there should be a tie to raising revenue thats the commonsense approach to take"], [0.1803964376449585, 0.8196035623550415, 1, "i thank the gentlelady so

war against a tactic for instance the united states was not engaged in a war against the blitzkrieg or the kamikaze in 1941 through 1945 al qaeda and the taliban are indeed our enemy but we are not at war with al qaeda or the taliban they are simply the regiments and battalions of the ideological army to which they belong the united states was not at war with the 12th german panzer division or the 55th japanese infantry regiment from 1941 to 1945 in fact before the rise of al qaeda the terrorist group that had inflicted the most damage on the united states was hezbollah and let us never forget the loss in the beirut bombing of those 240someodd marines today hezbollah has evolved into a highly capable military force albeit one without state or uniform so capable in fact they have armed missiles within striking distance of every city in israel yet several american presidential administrations have failed to clearly identify hezbollah as an enemy until we as a nation are able to correctly and openly identify our enemy we will continue to put our men and women on the ground in harms way without a clear mission for success on this 21st century battlefield we are not fighting against a single organization a single leader or a single nation we are fighting against a radical islamic fundamentalism which knows no country recognizes no borders and wears no uniform it is islamism a theocratic political totalitarian ideology no different from nazism fascism and communism which threatens the free world our enemy does not distinguish between combatants be them lawful combatants unlawful combatants or even noncombatants as required by the geneva convention our enemy does not distinguish between military and civilian targets so how do we understand the complexities of this global conflagration in which we are engaged and how do we make the changes necessary to defeat it with the appropriate strategic level of perspective because we will never lose at the tactical level on the ground because the united states has the best soldiers sailors airmen marines and coastguardsmen the world has ever known but without the correct strategic and operational goals well be on the proverbial hamster wheel no matter how much effort we exert we will not make forward progress so now that we have defined the enemy we must develop strategic imperatives i believe that there are three strategic imperatives to engage to deter and to strike we must clearly then identify specific strategic level objectives and there are four first we must deny the enemy sanctuary the number one asset our military has is its strategic mobility when that is curtailed by a focus on nationbuilding or occupationstyle warfare we eliminate our primary advantage and worse turn our military forces into targets because this enemy truly indeed has no respect for those borders and boundaries therefore we must be willing to take the fight directly to him second we must interdict the enemys flow of men material and resources we have to cut off the enemys ability to fund supply and replenish his ranks as my colleague just spoke our own energy independence is a vital part of that goal third we must win the information war unfortunately the enemy is far more adept at exploiting the power of the internet broadcast media and dissemination of powerful imagery in addition i fear that there are some in our media who now see themselves as an ideological political wing if we cannot fully utilize information as a resource and part of our national power we will lose this battle if not our country the great example of this occurred during the tet offensive when the north vietnamese used information to their benefit against a superior american fighting force despite their own troops being badly depleted in the attack our enemies were able to paint the outcome as a devastating loss for the united states a former vietcong minister of justice truong nhu tang would later write it is a major irony of the vietnam war that our propaganda transmuted this military debacle into a brilliant victory giving us new leverage in our diplomatic efforts inciting the american antiwar movement and disheartening the washington planners today the islamic fundamentalist enemy collectively portrays themselves as the victims of imperialism just as the axis and communist powers defined the free world as aggressors in order to cover up their crimes and designs for global domination totalitarian islam seeks to replicate the exact same strategy the nowdeceased osama bin laden incited violence against americans by invoking just such language when he said unitedstates soldiers only fight for capitalists usury takers and the merchants of arms and oil including the gang of crime at the white house under these circumstances there will be no harm if the interests of muslims converge with the interests of socialists in the fight against the crusaders fourth as far as strategic objectives we must cordon off the enemy and reduce his sphere of influence we have to shrink the enemys territory and not allow any political cultural educational and financial infiltration into the united states what happened with major malik nadal hasan at fort hood texas should not have been possible in this country we must not turn a blind eye to a bold enemy who is telling us exactly what he wants to do and who is willing to bring the battle to our doorsteps furthermore for us to classify this jihadist attack as workplace violence defies sanity it is important that we must not hamstring our troops through the rules of engagement let us trust our men and women who are fighting for the preservation of this great constitutional republic and that includes our domestic law enforcement these should be our goals deny the enemy sanctuary cut off his flow of resources use information to our advantage and reduce his sphere of influence we must recognize that iraq and afghanistan are not wars but combat theaters of operation it is up to our elected leaders and strategiclevel military officials to identify and agree on the correct goals and objectives beyond identifying the enemy and defining our objectives in kinetic battle we must also understand and recognize the truly nonkinetic conflicts of the 21st century battlefield one need only review the collapse of the soviet union to understand great nations can be toppled economically as well as militarily in fact one country paid particular close attention to the fall of the soviet union and that was china in fact chinas efforts to modernize its economy were taken explicitly from the playbook of lenin during the period of the new economic policy lenin sought to place market mechanisms in a communist economy to preserve the rule of the party and modernize this wars industries it also sought to deceive the west into believing that communism had been weakened and was therefore a less formidable opponent china has been mimicking this tactic for decades its time that we took notice currently the united states is providing a great economic advantage to china by allowing them to have an incredible trade surplus and hold nearly 30 percent of our debt we must recognize that china is not using that advantage to improve the standard of living of its citizens instead it is taking its economic edge to the 21st century battlefield within 10 years the worlds largest bluewater navy will fly not under a united states but a chinese flag why is that important because no matter how technology changes in the future the earths surface will still be covered 70 percent by water all of the great civilizationsfrom the venetians to the romans to the portuguese spanish dutch english and the japaneseunderstood that the power and reach of a nation is extended not through a great army but through a strong navy in 1990 the united states possessed 570 naval war vessels today we have 285projected to go even lower if we cannot protect the sea lanes of commerce we leave ourselves vulnerable not just militarily but economically to a power in china that continues to seek world communism as its ultimate goal irrefutably so i could spend the entire special order talking about china because i believe in this century china could become the premier dominant nation in the world and while the relationship between china and the united states is based on mutual needs at this moment i am concerned for the day when china realizes this relationship is more of a hindrance than a need and we always need to prepare if that day is to come as a veteran of operation iraqi freedom who served during the initial battles of that conflict i am proud to be among the more than 1 million americans who served in iraq what my fellow comrades in arms achieved in that country is nothing short of historic together we defeated one of historys most tyrannical dictatorships and replaced it with what could be a free and democratic muslim government american soldiers sailors airmen and marines beat back a radical islamic insurgency and helped create what we hope foran ally and partner in freedom i will never forget those with whom i served and those who served after i left that battlefield i will always remember the sacrifice borne by so many servicemembers and their families however i have to question the motives of president barack obama in announcing a full withdrawal of american forces in october of 2011 did the president press the commanders on the ground before making that decision what kind of message does our sudden withdrawal send to our allies such as the kurds in the northern part of iraq do they feel abandoned yet again my fear is that political expediency drove that decision not recommendations from the military leadership not a strategic understanding of the 21st century battlefield for over 10 years our nation has been on the offensive against islamic totalitarianism radical islamic terrorism and specific individuals who want to harm our country and kill our citizens ten years ago a band of thugs declared war on the united states our fellow americans and our way of life the last decade in afghanistan has seen peaks and valleys triumph and tragedy unspeakable horror and unimaginable bravery during our long and difficult march towards victory while a decade may seem like a long period of time we must remember that our enemies have been at war with our way of life for nearly a generation from beirut to the khobar towers from the uss cole to the first bombing of the world trade center from the total destruction of the united states embassies in kenya and tanzania to september 11 we must never forget that we did not choose this fightthe fight chose us while we may not have executed this combat operation perfectlybut then no war ever has beenwe cannot pretend that radical islam does not exist the killings of osama bin laden and other radical terrorist leaders are significant victories however the fight continues there is evil in this world that must be confronted lest our nation sees more of its citizens maimed and killed in acts of terror i will continue to urge our president and his administration my colleagues on capitol hill and our congressional leadership to pressure pakistan to crack down on terrorists within their borders a particular concern is the haqqani network which is responsible for so much violence and bloodshed i urge our leaders on both sides of the aisle to finish what was started in this part of the world ten years after september 11 it remains absolutely vital to our national security that we succeed in afghanistan and how do we define success we cannot grant the enemy another opportunity to use that country as a home base for planning strikes against our nation deny the enemy sanctuary unconditional withdrawal from afghanistan as we have done in iraq without considering the ground situation or the advice of top military advisers would be absolutely reckless allowing afghanistan to revert to its previous condition under taliban control overturns the progress made so dearly by our forces and it creates new threats to all americans and this world let me be clear if we exit without delivering a crushing blow to the taliban and other extremists therein they will bring the fight to us and while i believe the men and women serving in afghanistan are performing bravely above and beyond it is vital that they are given all the tools necessary to succeed we must ensure that they have the proper equipment the proper weapons systems a clearly defined mission but most importantly flexible rules of engagement that do not needlessly put their lives at risk recently prime minister benjamin netanyahu was in the united states delivering remarks that reinforce that the state of israel is a bright light in a dark ocean of tyranny and oppression israel must be allowed to defend itself from external and internal aggression the israeli people must be allowed to continue to build within their own borders and jerusalem must be recognized irrefutably as the nations only capital furthermore the united states must stand by israels side in the face of a united nations which clearly views the state of israel through a lens tinged with antisemitic hatred which unfortunately we just saw played out in france anything less than full support for israel and its citizens at the united nations by the united states government is simply unacceptable i am concerned that israel americas strongest and most loyal ally in the middle east has become more isolated and vilified since barack obama became president than ever before in its existence and i believe the united states congress has a solemn duty to ensure that the homeland of the jewish people remains as such the united states and israel share the common bonds of freedom liberty and democracy and the right to worship in the name of any religion as you see fit we share a common enemy though in radical islam and we have both seen our citizens murdered by these terrorist thugs we are indeed each others greatest ally for without the united states israel would not exist and without israel the united states would soon fall today the bonds between us must be stronger than ever because those bonds are threatened as never before israel is a small country surrounded by enemies the united states however is a large country being infiltrated by the same enemies like us the israelis seek only to be one nation under god with liberty and justice for all and as the bible makes clear in leviticus chapter 25 verse 10 our purpose is to proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof the bottom line is this our judeochristian faith heritage calls us to duty to stand beside the modernday state of israel therefore if we discuss israel we must discuss the palestinian authority it is quite simple no entity that aligns itself with a group that calls for the complete and total destruction of another country should ever be granted statehood i will never support funding for the palestinian authority or the recognition of a palestinian state as long as they are reconciled and connected with hamas further i have cosponsored house resolution 394 to support israels right to annex judea and samaria if the palestinian authority continues to press for the unilateral recognition of palestinian statehood at the united nations a united nationsrecognized palestinian state could place israelis under the sovereignty of a group that actively seeks their destruction this is unacceptable and in the absence of a negotiated peace agreement israel has the right to protect its citizens living in judea and samaria by annexing those territories there cannot be peace without a growing peace party now more than ever is a time to stand with our ally israel and thanks in large part to the socalled arab spring of democratic revolutionaries israel is beleaguered and surrounded by hostility on all sides the israeli embassy in cairo egypt was almost seized and turkey once a prominent ally has even shown intimations of threatening israel with war all the while hamas terrorists in gaza fire rockets into israeli cities on a pretty much daily basis there is a realistic chance that many european countries will recognize a palestinian state russia is already offering enthusiastic support for a declaration of statehood and last year president obama expressed his hope for such an outcome the palestinians are now using that support as part of their media campaign even the democrat party is opposing congresswoman ileana roslehtinens commonsense legislation house resolution 2829 this bill seeks more transparency and accountability within the united nations an organization that allows countries like china cuba saudi arabia and others to control the human rights council the bill also requires steps to be taken to dismantle terrorist infrastructures and arrest terrorists control palestinian security organizations and end the incitement of violence and hatred in the palestinian media educational institutions and mosques and most importantly it requires the united nations to recognize israels right to exist as a jewish state i am pleased to support this legislation and commend my florida colleague the chairwoman of the committee on foreign affairs for introducing this legislation lets be clear there is no greater threat to israel and the united states today than the development of nuclear weapons by iran president obama has tried to take the diplomatic route when negotiating with iran but that is an effort that has indisputably failed iran has twice sent their warships through the suez canal within the last year in a blatant message to israel and recently an iranian defense official threatened to send warships to the east coast of the united states of america i believe iran poses a genuine threat to democracies around the world iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad spouts hatred against freedom of speech and religion everywhere while opposing his own people at home further he denies the holocaust ever happened and has stated that anybody who recognizes israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury iran continues to push for nuclear weapons and has the capability to enrich uranium it remains a state sponsor of terrorism and has aided internationally recognized terrorist organizations like hezbollah hezbollah along with organizations like hamas and al qaeda is committed to seeing the destruction of the democratic freedoms that we treasure along with the state of israel in its entirety as a member of the united states house of representatives one of my objectives is to protect the safety and security of israel a stable israel is important to a stable united states and iran is a constant threat to that stability we must stop lying to ourselves about iran for we are barreling toward a point at which we wont be able to prevent that nation from acquiring nuclear weapons without a massive military strike it must not come to that iran is merely months away from producing sufficient weaponsgrade uranium for a 15kiloton bomb a development which will put american naval vessels and the strait of hormuz at risk as you know i have spent a lot of my adult life in uniform some of it on that field of battle in iraq those of us who fought in operation iraqi freedom knew that our enemies received considerable assistance from the islamic republic of iran many of the terrorist thugs who targeted american troops in that combat operation just as many of those who target our troops in afghanistan today received guidance training weapons money and an untold number of explosives that have killed or terribly maimed so many of our nations finest our comrades we knew it without a doubt we knew it because the components of those bombs bore irrefutable proof of iranian manufacture yet to this day most americans are unaware of the support the iraqi insurgency received from the iranians iran declared war on the united states of america nearly 33 years ago and has waged that war ever since the iranian war against america is not limited to our troops indeed as we have recently learned from the attorney general and the director of the fbi the iranians are prepared to kill american civilians right here in washington if they happen to be in the same place at the same time as an intended target of assassination our dealings with iran are not a partisan political matter a failure to respond to their murderous attacks is a national failure not a failure of one party or another or one leader or set of leaders this is a war whether we decide to fight it or not they are waging war against us yet our public discourse rarely if ever bothers to mention that fact every so often someone will remind us that iran is the worlds leading sponsor of terrorism but even that does not encapsulate the truth of the matter they are killing us every single day if you want to see what the consequences of an iranian victory would look like just observe what life is like for the citizens of iran anyone who voices opposition to the government or complains about the oppressive treatment of the nations women is arrested tortured and often killed independent newspapers have long since been silenced access to the internet is blocked or filtered with the same technology used in the peoples republic of china the washington post editorialist writing about the iranians feverish efforts to construct atomic weapons put it very bluntly when they wrote by now it should be obvious that only regime change will stop the iranian nuclear program and only regime change will stop the iranian war against america only regime change will bring an end to the mullahs global dream the washington post thinks that sanctions can help provided they are serious sanctions that strike at the heart of irans financial system i have no problem supporting such an effort but i doubt that that will be enough because sanctions are only effective when a regime cares for its people iran is a theocracy an acquisition of a nuclear weapon will enable them to achieve their goal the restoration of the islamic caliphate we have another even more powerful weapon to aim at the islamic dictatorship of iran the iranian people and its time to use it there can be no doubt that the people of iran are yearning for new leaders 21 2 years ago millions of them took to the streets to protest against election fraud and to call for an end to the islamic dictatorship there can be little doubt that unlike so many of the uprisings in the muslim world the overwhelming majority of the iranians do not want radical jihadist overlords they want a separation of mosque and state with the mullahs in the mosque not running the state of all the opposition movements in the muslim middle east the iranian one is the closest to us the only one that surely wants to be part of the western world so why then has the iranian opposition movement not been explicitly endorsed by our government why do the president and the secretary of state continue to talk about reaching an agreement with the tehran regime why does the president not say that ahmadinejad and khomeini must go if qadhafi had to go and mubarak had to go and assad must go why not the iranian terror masters since the president and the secretary of state are unwilling to spell it out i will offer my assistance ahmadinejad and khomeini have to go along with their evil henchmen we need clear language from our leaders that states down with the islamic republic of iran which represents a clear and present evil in our world we hereby call for a free iran and we are willing to support an effort by the iranian people to liberate their country president ronald reagan recognized the threat of inaction and he laid out a road map on how to confront evil in our world three decades ago first tell the truth tell it often tell it everywhere the truth is that iran is in the clutches of evil people who kill iranians and support the killing of israelis and americans every day and who will kill even more if and when they get nuclear atomic bombs and warheads the truth is that we have tried to reach some sort of reasonable agreement with them for more than 30 years the truth is they dont want it they want to destroy us and thats what they mean when they chant death to america second our leaders and representatives must call for the release of political prisoners being persecuted in that country to include the iranian christian minister being threatened with execution when our diplomats attend international conferences they should arrive with lists of victims in iran and they should read those lists its harder for totalitarian regimes to kill people with names than to slaughter faceless victims third we should broadcast the facts to the iranian people they need to know that we stand with them they need to know whats going on inside their country this is based on our experience during the cold war when it turned out people inside the soviet union knew more about events in london and paris and washington than inside their own borders thats why radio free europe and radio liberty were such potent instruments of peace our broadcasts are often jammed by the iranian regime we must defeat their censorship finally we have to track down the killers of americans and bring them to justice the world must know anyone that takes an american life will be targeted and taken out in any country on the planet those who kill our citizens will not find safe haven in iran a majority of the america media did not feel it was important to report that iranian president ahmadinejad visited cuba venezuela ecuador and nicaragua this past january president ahmadinejad threatened almost 200 years of precedent established by the monroe doctrine when he declared that from now on latin america will no longer be in the backyard of the united states president ahmadinejad is assisting hugo chavez with missile sites and has joked with that south american dictator about pointing a warhead at the united states and there are hezbollah camps in south america chavez himself has offered to send troops to fight with the taliban and has reportedly funded al qaeda president ahmadinejad has recruited the mexican drug cartels for an attempted assassination of a saudi ambassador in the united states president ahmadinejads sphere of influence is not limited to the middle east he is entering our hemisphere and showing the influence that he has in this region and that goes back to our fourth strategic objective president obama seems to be uninterested in the principles of the monroe doctrine because after all he did take the wrong side in honduras and he has laughed it up with hugo chavez the syrian government meanwhile is continuing its vicious crackdown on innocent syrian civilians seeking only freedom and democracy according to available figures almost 10 000 syrians have lost their lives and thousands more have been injured many more have been forced to flee the international atomic energy agency also recently concluded that the secret syrian facility destroyed by israel in september of 2007 was very likely a nuclear reactor based on a north korean model capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons the syrian government has become a conduit in irans arming of hezbollah shiite forces in lebanon and hamas in gaza they have provided a safe docking station for iranian warships and they possess an arsenal of chemical weapons and missiles that i fear could end up in the hands of terrorists with which they are associated the threat posed by the assad regime to the united states to our allies and the syrian people is stark and growing the time to increase pressure on that regime is now that is why i joined other members of congress in sending a letter to president obama requesting that he implement additional sanctions on syria the people of that country deserve a government that represents their aspirations and respects their basic human rights it is clear that bashar alassad is not willing to implement genuine reforms and that he lacks the legitimacy to lead the syrian people the united states and all responsible nations must hold the regime accountable and the brutality must end additional sanctions would show the syrian people that we stand with them in their struggle for democratic freedoms while also making it clear to the syrian regime that it will pay an increasingly high cost for its gross violations of human rights and dignity which is why unesco should expel syria and strongly condemn them and not repeatedly attack israel but however we must realize that theres an interesting turn in syria with the iranian and russian presence evolving it was not too long ago the american people watched a transition in egypt with this administration claiming we were witnessing a new dawn of democracy today instead we are witnessing the nightmare of one of the greatest threats to the stability in the middle east a new egyptian government under the muslim brotherhood the egyptian parliament is now controlled by a majority of radical islamists and the muslim brotherhood is turning egypt into a radical islamic state the muslim brotherhood also maintains active ties to hamas a terrorist organization that openly calls for the destruction of israel of course america should stand with the egyptian people however if the radical elements of the muslim brotherhood are left unchecked in that country the security of the citizens of israel egypt and the united states all will be in jeopardy on july 19 2011 i wrote a letter to the house committee on armed services chairman buck mckeon on the troubling revelation of a possible unitedstates military sale to the government of egypt it stated in my letter it has come to my attention that the defense security cooperative agency notified congress on july 1 2011 of a possible foreign military sale to the government of egypt for 125 miai abrams tank kits for coproduction and associated weapons equipment and parts training and logistical support america must continue to stand with the egyptian people and encourage them to build their own democracy with new political parties and freedoms however we must exercise caution with regard to military sales and support to the egyptian government until a government is formed absent of the radical elements of the muslim brotherhood that would maintain an active peace with israel speaking of the muslim brotherhood i would like to quote to you directly from a former supreme guide of the international muslim brotherhood in december of 2005 mohammed akef said the brotherhood is a global movement whose members cooperate with each other throughout the world based on the same religious world view the spread of islam until it rules the world three years ago a court found a muslim charity right here in the united states guilty of funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group hamas that was the holy land foundation trial the council of islamic relations cair was named as an unindicted coconspirator that case included testimony that hamas parent organization the muslim brotherhood planned to establish a network of organizations to spread the militant islamist message right here in the united states in its own explanatory memorandum for north america the muslim brotherhood stated that its strategic goal is to establish an islamic center in every city in order to supply our battalions through its various front organizations in the united states the muslim brotherhood is succeeding in cultural whitewashing to eliminate all references to islamist terrorism in our public discourse after the 9 11 commission identified islamic terrorism as a threat in this country the muslim public affairs council recommended the united states government find other terminology as a result the fbi counterterrorism lexicon and the 2009 national intelligence strategy included not a single reference to islam muslim the muslim brotherhood hamas or hezbollah furthermore after major nidal hasans attack on fort hood the department of defense report used the terms violent extremism and islam only once in a footnote again that incident was officially classified as workplace violence we must also be concerned about north korea i was stationed in north korea in 1995 along the demilitarized zone i stood on the 38th parallel and looked through the barbed wire and landmines and there you can see a repressed nation i saw for myself what a ticking timebomb that country can be sooner or later north korea will either implode or it will explode the situation in north korea most closely resembles a street gang where the leader of the gang is killed and a young guy must step up in that instance it is critical for the newly appointed top dog to establish his credibility by proving himself and today north korea is ruled by a 28yearold appointed fourstar general now it took me 22 years to become a lieutenant colonel you can begin to understand how dangerous a situation is brewing just west of the sea of japan the tactics do not change and the game is getting tired anytime north korea finds itself in need of money it saber rattles with the threat of a secret nuclear arms program it has fired artillery onto the south korea island and sunk five south korean naval vessels again and again the international community responds with misguided attempts to buy the country off threaten to go nuclear and get funding in exchange i call that international extortion the dprk newspaper nodong sinmun and other mouthpieces for the workers party of korea sensed this policy of weakness and referred to the disbursement of food and aid as tribute if theres one thing weve learned its that the north koreans cannot be trusted to voluntarily disarm they are playing our country and the entire western world for fools sooner or later well need to step up and stand up to this simmering menace just a few hundred miles from japan in conclusion if we miss this opportunity to recognize the 21st century battlefieldand understand we did not talk about africa we did not talk about somalia and we did not talk about our own border security i thank my colleague from indiana for speaking about energy independence but if we miss this opportunity for understanding what this battlefield truly is to understand the threats and to lay out a strategic vigil for victory we will lose the opportunity to ensure that our children and grandchildren of america will have a secure future as a country we must roll up our sleeves and devise a roadmap for security we must be mindful of the wise words penned by sun tzu in the book the art of war more than 25 centuries ago to know your enemy and to know yourself and to know your environment in countless battles you will always be victorious if we do not understand this simple maxim we face dark days ahead indeed and that shadow could not only fall on this country but on the entire world because no matter what our detractors may think we are that beacon we are that lighthouse we are as president ronald reagan said the shining city that sits upon a hill for the sake of our nation and of all nations that seek freedom for their citizens we must be prepared to fight on this 21st century battlefield and we can settle for no less than victory upon it those of us who have served in battle are the last to desire it but as john stuart mill once wrote war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse policymakers and those of us here in washington d c should heed the wise words of george santayana he who does not learn from history is doomed to repeat it i will always stand by the men and women of the armed forces and i am proud to represent them as a combat veteran in the united states congress i will always continue to protect our nation as i once did on the battlefield and as i am now

line of duty congress has amended the psob program many times since its inception some of the changes have resulted in inconsistencies within the law or have unintentionally resulted in a delay in the psob benefit process for example each psob claimant must be examined by an impartial medical examiner who then advises the justice department regarding their decision to award benefits but the psob statute and its regulations require that the medical examiner be hired from the city where the officer was killed or injured this causes significant delays and adds expense in processing psob claims and in administering the overall program the department spends significant time and resources to find a medical professional who is familiar with the psob program and its requirements that medical professional must also be available and agree to perform the necessary medical exam this process can take weeks if not months to complete this bill provides a solution to this inefficiency it allows the department to develop and draw from a pool of trusted qualified medical professionals to perform the necessary examinations across the country this is similar to how the psob program authorizes their hearing examiners this simple change saves valuable time and taxpayer dollars it also ensures that the public safety officers and their families receive these muchneeded benefits more quickly h r 4018 also clarifies who are eligible beneficiaries when an officer is killed in the line of duty currently the payment of benefits is often postponed sometimes for years while the issue of who is the proper beneficiary is litigated this bill creates a new category of beneficiaries adult children of deceased public safety officers to clarify eligible beneficiaries in certain cases where there are none these cases include when a public safety officers children are all adults there is no surviving spouse no applicable designation of beneficiary is on file with the public agency and the

truthtellers people in congress who will just tell them what the problems are that this country faces give them options and help them make the right choice people who are strong enough to lead and bold enough to lead at a time when the country needs leadership when it comes to the budget when it comes to the economy where the president has failed house republicans will lead the paul ryan budget helps spur job creation in america today it stops spending money the government doesnt have it lifts the crushing burden of debt this plan puts the budget on the path to balance in paying down the debt over the long term and it puts the economy on the path to prosperity lets talk about the economy it is the number one concern of most people and the debt and deficit have a lot to do with it we are undergoing one of the worst recoveries weve seen in a long time it is two to three times slower than the reagan recovery and there is reason for that we were told by the president and congressional democrats that if we just spent money spend it in the stimulus and spend it in increased deficits that the economy would recover and they were wrong after spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the stimulus we have 2 million fewer jobs in america today than when the stimulus began we have fewer jobs today than when all that spending took off we were told if congress passed all the stimulus bills that our unemployment rate today would be 6 8 percent its 8 8 percent and its only that low because so many people have given up simply looking for work anymore theyve lost hope and then finally for those who say we just spend more to create this economy they were off their predictions by 7 million american jobs its time to stop listening to the economists who got it wrong and start listening to economists who got it right lets take a look at what spending has done to our economy in america here is a chart it looks back on the last 40 years in america and it tracks federal government spending against job creation along main street not government jobs but jobs in the private sector the small medium and largesized businesses that our economy depends upon the blue line is government spending the red line represents jobs along main street you can tell with the blue line look at how different job creation is in fact over each of these four decades not only is there no correlation between federal spending and jobs along main street but its a negative correlation in each of the 4 decades as government spending goes up jobs along main street go down look at this next chart we also went back the last four decades in america and asked about private business investment what happens when companies large and small buy new equipment buy new software buy new buildings and invest back in the economy here is the chart the blue is the private fixed investment from business the red is job creation along main street as you can tell its a very close correlation in fact there is no substitute in america for private investment in the economyno substitute no rebates no stimulus no shovelready projects nothing is a substitute for creating jobs like getting businesses to invest back in their workforces in their workplaces and in the economy recently i had the joint economic committee take a look at the economic studies over the last 40 years of our competitors around the world competitor countries that got themselves into debt trouble but that worked their way out of it you would be interested in the results of this study and there are three key points to it one is that the countries that were most successful in getting their debt down in getting ahold of their financial paths didnt do it by raising taxes that didnt succeed they did it by reducing spending thats how they best and most successfully got ahold of their debt there were 21 times that 10 different of our global competitor countries got a handle on their debt successfully by reducing spending the second takeaway from this study called spend less owe less grow the economy was that countries that got ahold of their debt the right way also grew the economy as well economists agree that the countries that get their financial houses in order grow their economies over the long term what this study shows is that with our competitors if you get a handle on your spending the right way you grow your economy in the short term as well here is canada neighboring canada got themselves in financial trouble their economy was growing at a paltry pace less than 1 percent a year they lowered their debt as a nation by about 12 percentage points and their economy took off for almost 16 years theyve averaged economic growth of almost 31 2 percent sweden another developed country with an economy like ours actually had an economy that was shrinking it was actually contracting they got ahold of their financial house and put that in order as well reducing their debt by more than 11 percentage points their economy took off growing 31 2 percent a year on average for almost a decade new zealand did the same you may say look were not canada were not new zealand were not sweden yet 26 times nine of our competitor countries around the world that lowered their debt by reducing spending grew their economies strongly not just in the long term but in the short term they didnt grow them a little those countries rocketed to the top quarter of economic growth in the world countries that reduce their spending and do it the right way grow their economies here is a third and another again telling point about this which is that not all spending cuts are the same when it comes time to grow the economy not all spending cuts are the same what these economists showed is that the nations that grew their economies the most successfully undertook cuts that were large credible and difficult to reverse so they made cuts in savings that mattered and the cuts in savings that grew their economies made sense they shrunk their federal workforces they rightsized them to what they could afford they eliminated duplicate programs obsolete programsas a business wouldprograms that waste money they reduced subsidies to corporations which were interfering in the free marketplace finally they tackled their entitlement reforms in health care and in pensions what is interesting is that even if the reforms they made in their entitlements didnt affect their current beneficiaries and even if they phased those reforms in over time the reforms sent the right signals to the marketplace then what happened in each of these countries is that businesses in no longer facing higher taxes because of all that spending felt comfortable getting to reinvest back into their workforces back into their countries economies households like ours in no longer facing higher taxes to pay for all these spending sprees felt more comfortable buying larger ticket items like cars and houses as we know when businesses invest jobs along main street grow it has been made clear time and time and time again like businesses countries that can get ahold of their debt that can do it the right way and that can put themselves on financially sound paths grow americas economy can grow as well the budget resolution presented tonight by chairman paul ryan meets the test that spending reductions must be large credible and difficult to reverse once made to boost our economy the ryan budget attacks the medical entitlements that are driving federal spending higher it attacks corporate welfare by phasing out government guaranties to fannie mae and freddie mac it eliminates subsidies for green energy and it reduces agriculture subsidies by 30 billion over the next decade the ryan budget rolls back nonsecurity discretionary spending to its 2008 levels and then freezes it for 5 years it adopts a number of the recommendations from the presidents own fiscal commission to eliminate waste and to achieve real savings in our budget it eliminates agencies and programs identified by our own government as wasteful and duplicative that alone will save over 100 billion in the next decade it reduces the federal workforce it rightsizes the federal workforce by 10 percent over the next 5 years by attrition simply by hiring only one new federal employee for every three employees who leave or retire together that saves almost 400 billion the ryan budget envisions a progrowth tax reform that lowers the top income tax rate for both individuals and companies to 25 percent and makes us competitive again in this world the ryan budget is a fiscally responsible plan that accelerates economic growth and job creation it is a gamechanger for this nation and tells the truth about our challenges and addresses them with ideas and proven solutions that move us forward i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.8144082427024841, 0.8144082427024841, 0, "simon garfunkel said in the song

commission to address the deficit i called it the safe commission short for securing americas future economy everything would be on the table for discussionentitlements all other spending programs and tax policyand like the brac process congress would be required to vote up or down on the commissions recommendations my colleague and good friend jim cooper of tennessee joined me in sponsoring this legislation in 2007 and in subsequent years it ultimately became the blueprint for the presidents national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform more commonly referred to as the simpsonbowles commission the simpsonbowles commission produced a credible plan that gained the support of a bipartisan majority of the commissions 18 members called the moment of truth the commissions report made clear that eliminating the debt and deficit will not be easy and that any reform must begin with entitlements mandatory and discretionary spending also has to be addressed as well other sacred cows including tax reform and defense spending had just three more members of the simpsonbowles commission supported the recommendations this plan likely would have passed the congress and be law today i was disappointed that the president and his administration walked away from the commission the president failed the country leadership on both sides of the congressional aisle has done no better this town is dysfunctional if the plan had advanced we would already be on our way in getting our nations fiscal house in order over the past year and a half i have repeatedly said that while there are some changes i would make i would support a budget proposal similar to or based on simpsonbowles if it came to a vote on the house floor i want to commend mr cooper and mr latourete today for offering this substitute amendment which was drafted using the bipartisan principals of the simpsonbowles commission simpsonbowles provides the framework for the most comprehensive and realistic solution to our nations fiscal problems i have submitted the preamble of the simpsonbowles commission report for the record which i believe is a worthy read as we debate the cooperlatourette substitute every member of congress and the president know the dire economic situation facing our country a debt load over 15 5 trillion annual deficits over 1 trillion and unfunded obligations and liabilities over 65 trillion on the books to pay for programs such as social security medicare and medicaid were borrowing this money from nations such as chinawhich is spying on us where human rights are an afterthought and catholic bishops protestant ministers and tibetan monks are jailed for practicing their faithand oilexporting countries such as saudi arabiawhich funded the radical madrasahs on the afghanpakistan border resulting in the rise of the taliban and al qaeda we always say we want to leave our country better than we found it and to give our children and grandchildren hope for the future just today noted historian niall ferguson testified before my subcommittee and said that if we do not change course the debt burden will not only crush our children and grandchildren but also the current generation in the very near futu re according to the congressional budget offices long term estimate every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025 every penny that means no money for national defense no money for homeland security no money to fix the nations crumbling bridges and roads no money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or alzheimers or parkinsons diseases we have to find a solution to this debt crisis failure is not an option congress and the president must be willing to support a plan that breaks loose from the special interests holding washington by the throat and return confidence to the country congress and the president also need to be honest with the american people and explain that we cannot solve our nations financial crisis by just cutting waste fraud and abuse within discretionary accounts the real runaway spending is occurring in our outofcontrol entitlement costs and the hundreds of billions in annual tax earmarks until we reach an agreement that addresses these two drivers of our deficit and debts we cannot right our fiscal ship of state i amand have beenwilling to make the hard choices to ensure a better future for our children and grandchildren every two years i take an oath to support and defend the constitution i do not sign pledges to lobbyists or special interest groups if the cooperlatourette substitute does not pass today i will vote to support the ryan budget proposal so that we may move the budget process forward and continue the necessary discussions to address our nations financial crisis but i hope this substitute passes it is a balanced and ambitious roadmap to address our deficit it also is the only truly bipartisan plan that is being offered and i believe the only plan that has the opportunity to be approved by the senate more important this proposal calls for difficult decisions by finding savings to completely turn off the budget control acts looming sequestration which could devastate our defense capabilities as i mentioned earlier i do not agree with every recommendation in the simpsonbowles plan nor do i support every part of the cooperlatourette substitute for example i fully support efforts to repeal and replace the patient protection and affordable care act and regret that cooperlatourette is silent on the need to address this issue i am also concerned about the instructions proposed for the committee of jurisdiction over the federal workforce this could impact workers including the fbi and cia agents serving in afghanistan cbp agents stopping illegal immigrants coming across our borders the va doctors caring for our veterans and the nih medical researchers working to develop cures for cancer diabetes alzheimers and autism however the cooperlatourette substitute is the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we must have it is the kind of forthright realistic conversation about our nations fiscal future in which we must engage across the aisle across the capitol and down pennsylvania avenue if we are to have any hope of coming up with a credible plan to protect the future for our children and grandchildren every member should support this substitute preamble throughout our nations history americans have found the courage to do right by our childrens future deep down every american knows we face a moment of truth once again we cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer without regard to party we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of america to give our children and grandchildren a better life our challenge is clear and inescapable america cannot be great if we go broke our businesses will not be able to grow and create jobs and our workers will not be able to compete successfully for the jobs of the future without a plan to get this crushing debt burden off our backs ever since the economic downturn families across the country have huddled around kitchen tables making tough choices about what they hold most dear and what they can learn to live without they expect and deserve their leaders to do the same the american people are counting on us to put politics aside pull together not pull apart and agree on a plan to live within our means and make america strong for the long haul as members of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform we spent the past eight months studying the same cold hard facts together we have reached these unavoidable conclusions the problem is real the solution will be painful there is no easy way out everything must be on the table and washington must lead we come from different backgrounds represent different regions and belong to different parties but we share a common belief that americas longterm fiscal gap is unsustainable and if left unchecked will see our children and grandchildren living in a poorer weaker nation in the words of senator tom coburn we keep kicking the can down the road and splashing the soup all over our grandchildren every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only forces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next generation over the course of our deliberations the urgency of our mission has become all the more apparent the contagion of debt that began in greece and continues to sweep through europe shows us clearly that no economy will be immune if the unitedstates does not put its house in order the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe the president and the leaders of both parties in both chambers of congress asked us to address the nations fiscal challenges in this decade and beyond we have worked to offer an aggressive fair balanced and bipartisan proposal a proposal as serious as the problems we face none of us likes every element of our plan and each of us had to tolerate provisions we previously or presently oppose in order to reach a principled compromise we were willing to put our differences aside to forge a plan because our nation will certainly be lost without one we do not pretend to have all the answers we offer our plan as the starting point for a serious national conversation in which every citizen has an interest and all should have a say our leaders have a responsibility to level with americans about the choices we face and to enlist the ingenuity and determination of the american people in rising to the challenge we believe neither party can fix this problem on its own and both parties have a responsibility to do their part the american people are a long way ahead of the political system in recognizing that now is the time to act we believe that far from penalizing their leaders for making the tough choices americans will punish politicians for backing down and well they should in the weeks and months to come countless advocacy groups and special interests will try mightily through expensive dramatic and heartwrenching media assaults to exempt themselves from shared sacrifice and common purpose the national interest not special interests must prevail we urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about any of our recommendations to follow what we call the becerra rule dont shoot down an idea without offering a better idea in its place after all the talk about debt and deficits it is long past time for americas leaders to put up or shut up the era of debt denial is over and there can be no turning back we sign our names to this plan because we love our children our grandchildren and our country too much not

according to the gao they cant reconcile their books it was stripped out in the conference committee senator ayotte from new hampshire got one in the authorization bill it was stripped out in the conference committee now this time theyre acting proactively theyre prohibiting us from bringing an amendment to the floor of the house that would requireand were letting up on them a little bitthat 3 years from now the department of defensethats 1 8 trillion from nowshould have to pass an audit and theyre saying no no no no they cant be required to do an audit until they spend 3 6 trillion in the year 2017 this is an abuse of the american taxpayer and an abuse of our servicemen and women the waste that goes on at the pentagon has to stop we need a meaningful audit"], [0.004244118928909302,

bankruptcy and we have got to change course now as someone who until last year was protecting our cherished way of life by serving in the united states army ive got to tell you that i dont see this as a partisan issue both parties got us into this mess and were going to need leadership now to get out this has become the generational issue of our time and we need to begin to move towards a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility and everything needs to be on the table my family took the first cut to lead by example were giving back to the unitedstates treasury my pension that i earned this substitute amendment was intended to be a nonpartisan approach to an american issue cuts across the board democratic and republican priorities treated the same in this cr rolling back to 2008 levels rather than eliminating programs outright in the cr there will be time for those kinds of investigations later on in the budget process and in committees where programs can be singled out for deeper potential cuts and longterm structural changes as has been pointed out in the process of writing this there were some technical issues with it that we regret but the point of this substitute amendment remains the same that this is an american issue we both have to come together to solve this were going to have to get our fiscal house in order and to do that many steps are going to be necessary and among them is rolling back spending americans today are wondering whether or not were going to do the right thing and whether or not were going to cut that spending and whether or not our best days are in front of us that choice is up to us and we will get it right"], [0.005866378545761108, 0.4941336214542389, 0, "i understand the concerns of my friend across the aisle but im telling you this is a great day for congress for america going back to 1974 the most liberal congress in america until the time when speaker pelosi took the gavel in 1974 rules for cbo were put in place making it difficult to ever make actual tax cuts to help the economy grow as john f kennedy made clear and showed by his actions but that was also a time when congress thought it would be a good idea to create automatic increases of every discretionary departments budget in the federal budget automatic increases i mean there are times when increases would be appropriate and there are times when it would not be but why should the government not have to deal with financial issues like any responsible american like any responsible family there will be times when you should have to make cuts there will be times when you should have to make increases but what we saw through the 1990s back during my days when i was a judge i heard a guy named rush limbaugh bring up why do we have this automatic increase because then when conservatives try to slightly decrease the amount of increase theyre said to be making draconian cuts well i made a mental note when i got to congress in january of 05 i couldnt believe it to find out that we still had those automatic increases every year and then to be going through a troubled time like we are now when families across america are having to learn to do with less and make cuts across the board congress was still dealing with decreasing the amount of increase because we had these automatic increases we had a supercommittee that was formed last fall and try as they might they didnt even deal with the issue of the automatic increases the committees projections have had to be used because cbo because of the same 1974 rules ended up saying well gee the formula can slightly change each year so theres no way to know exactly what it will be over 10 years well one things pretty clear it would have been enough to clear the 1 2 trillion threshold in cuts and all it would have been doing is decreasing the amount of increase this is a great day for america when congress after all of these years 3738 years now congress is dealing with a financial issue that should have been dealt with long ago i brought this up back in 2005 and 2006 when republicans were in the majority and i was told back then by the chairman of the budget committee that well the law is that weve got to do the automatic increases so were just going to do it it is really thrilling to me to have a chairman of the budget committee who saw this as a real problem this should have been lowhanging fruit as people like to say this should have been an easy nobrainer cut out the automatic increases we have a chairman of the budget right now who saw it as a problem and it was also exciting to me to have a freshman like rob woodall come in and see it as a problem and collaborate discuss the matter because really to get a bill like this through you need to have somebody that will shepherd it all the way throughsubcommittee committeeto get it to this point so im very grateful to chairman ryan and im very grateful to mr woodall amazing as a freshman hes done an outstanding job and now here we are about to do what could be the most responsible financial thing this congress has done this house has done in the whole last year it could be 1 4 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years and all were doing is just stopping the automatic increase theres a lot to be said for finally coming around to responsibility theres a lot to be said if you need an increase come justify it dont get it automatically and we now have responsible action being taken and i urge adoption"], [0.006129145622253418, 0.5061291456222534, 0, "texas is burning since november texas has experienced

the state of texas and local governments along with our firefighters and our other first responders have done a magnificent job of responding to the threats of these wildfires however the resources of the state and the local government have been stretched responding to fires we have already had and the threat of wildfires continues without additional assistance the capacity to respond to future wildfires will be greatly diminished that is why governor perry requested a major disaster declaration and federal disaster assistance unfortunately president obama denied this request many in texas
