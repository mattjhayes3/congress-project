and consequences that have arisen since the passage of the original act over 30 years have passed since that time that has given us an awful good opportunity to see what sort of insight and experience in terms of what has worked in preserving and protecting endangered species and habitat and what just as importantly has not worked california faces numerous challenges in complying with the endangered species act like many parts of our country in california we have 293 threatened and endangered species in the state the second largest number in the nation we also have 11 million acres of designated critical habitat of which 30 percent of it is privately owned in kern county part of which lies in my district we have more listed species than any other county in the state of california to relay an anecdotal story of which there have been many here today in 1995 we had a chinese immigrantfarmer who believe it or not was jailed and prosecuted due to an accidental taking of a species on his land that he had farmed for years as a matter of fact his tractor had been confiscated as corroborating evidence as a result of that i and others in the california legislature led a successful effort to change the law to ensure that that would not happen again during the committee markup last week i successfully passed two amendments that clarify local governments role in participating in the development of habitat conservation planning as we know many of the habitat conservation plans have had difficulty in their adoption the ontheground information from our local governments and water agencies and land use agencies is beneficial in the crucial input in the listing process and for trying to provide recovery efforts that are successful the endangered species act needs improvement and i think this bill is a step in that direction it obviously is a work in progress but we should understand that the dilemma that we face in america today is that while we all want to protect native plants and species the dilemma is that our population growth has threatened the habitats for many of those plants and animals and therein lies the dilemma we must continue to work on efforts thati think are included in this legislation realizing that we are going to have to revisit them in future years i applaud the bipartisan efforts of the gentleman from california and the ranking member the gen tleman from west virginia and their staff for working with all the members of the committee and the gentleman from california for addressing the problems of the original bill i urge my colleagues to vote for its passage i would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the committee on resources my amendment that i referenced a moment ago that was accepted by the committee is meant to assure that states and units of local government have fair input in the listing process for threatened and endangered species local governments we know often have the best ontheground information on the status of communities of plants and animals that are in the area this bill would formally recognize the local governments rights to comment on the listing process and the acquisition of the best available sci entific data in many areas of california we have water districts that are an extremely active part of the local governmental units that are involved in the species recovery process the contributions that they make are many in order to understand the status and the challenges of the various species that are listed is it the chairmans understanding that the reference to units of local government in section 8 of the bill would include water districts"], [0.44000208377838135, 0.5599979162216187, 1, "i rise as a strong supporter of our armed forces a

national drug control policy reauthorization act and i was pleased that the house judiciary committee adopted two amendments that i offered and that they are part of the base bill street drug markets such as open air drug dealing at the corner and at drug houses are a serious public safety problem often located in poor minority and disadvantaged communities they cause severe harm by easing initiation into drug use supporting addiction and by drawing youth into the drug trade my first amendment which is designated sec 14 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to shut down illicit drug market hotspots by deterring drug dealers or altering the dynamic of drug sales this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to coordinate an effective intervention using a credible deterrent message this would encourage criminal justice agencies to collaborate with researchers and social welfare agencies to analyze local conditions and develop strategic problemsolving interventions such an approach was proven successful in high point nc upon identifying the drug market and its small group of active dealers law enforcement carefully monitored and documented drug activity and probation parole violations through surveillance and drug buys offenders with any violent criminal history were immediately arrested nonviolent offenders on the other hand were confronted by law enforcement city officials service organizations and their families with a strong deterrent message they were given a choice between facing immediate legal action or ceasing dealing and receiving rehabilitative services consequently the drug market promptly collapsed with minimal police intervention or crime displacement within one year of implementation the drug crime rate of high point fell by 34 and the violent crime rate was cut in half sec 14 of this bill authorizes 10 million for the next three years to fund demonstration programs supporting these interagency collaborations the agencies would be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the strategic intervention and the director would be responsible for submitting to congress a report identifying the best practices in drug market eradication my second amendment which is designated sec 15 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to coerce abstinence in chronic harddrug users under community supervision through the use of drug testing and sanctions this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to reduce the use of illicit drugs by chronic harddrug users living in the community while under the supervision of the criminal justice system approximately 80 percent of the nations cocaine is consumed by a relatively small group of chronic users approximately 4 million threequarters of these users are under the supervision of the criminal justice system by deterring these users we would be able to reduce the nations cocaine consumption by 60 percentand these numbers are similar for other hard drugs such as heroin and meth coerced abstinence is a highly effective means for targeting these users this model is based on predictable frequent drug testing and known nonnegotiable immediate graduated sanctions for example a system where a participant is tested every 72 hours and a dirty test led to an immediate unpleasant sanctionfor example 8 hours in a jury box or 24 hours in jail participants are simultaneously offered incentives such as drug treatment or other rehabilitative services an ongoing example of this model is being used in hawaii where substance abuse violations are common with meth being the drug of choice in october 2005 one year after the program began program participants had an 83 percent reduction in positive test results from 21 9 for control group to 3 8 for program participants and an 87 percent reduction in missed appointments for testing from 10 for control group to 1 3 for program participants this level of effectiveness we cannot ignore for this reason sec 15 of h r 2829 authorizes 10 million for the next 3 years for demonstration programs that administer drug tests to individuals at least twice a week and swiftly impose a known set of graduated sanctions for noncompliance the program must include a plan for monitoring the progress toward reducing the percentage of positive drugs and missed testing appointments and the director would be responsible for submitting to congress a report identifying the best practices in reducing the use of illicit drugs by chronic harddrug users i commend the office of national drug control policy for publicly committing itself to the goal of reducing illegal drug use and abuse in the united states however i also call on the director to increase the allocation of funds dedicated for treatment and demand reduction efforts which have shown to be very successful in reducing drug use to achieve this national drug control policy that efficiently reduces drug use and abuse in the united states we need strategies that are as smart as they are tough this requires that we remain

crossroads of the american revolution in new jersey as a national heritage area what a great and important story we have to tell our children that we have to tell the world the story of our war of independence and the land the houses the bridges and so much of new jersey today tell that story as many of my colleagues know new jersey is often referred to as the crossroads of the american revolution for a number of reasons thousands of troops crisscrossed the state and fought on our soil the states strategic location between the british stronghold of new york and the rebel capital in philadelphia meant that new jersey new jersey citizens were at the crossroads in fact new jersey had more military engagements during the revolutionary war than any other state although historians may know this some of us are working hard to make sure that the role of new jersey during the revolution is understood more broadly some of the most important events of the war especially the pivotal battles of trenton and princeton took place in new jersey new jersey has hundreds of remnants of the war today surviving including over 250 national register revolutionary war sites that are included in this heritage area designation covering 15 counties many traces of our nations revolutionary war heritage still exist mines mills encampment sites battlegrounds and barracks some of the sites include the hunt house in h5614 co hopewell new jersey the first headquarters of general washington as he chased the british from new york to pennsylvania or the old barracks in trenton where the troops were housed rockingham house where general washington wrote his farewell message to the troops or a road through the woods now long abandoned on which the soldiers marched to the battle of monmouth the sandy hook lighthouse which was the guardian of new york harbor and used by both british and american armies the list goes on and on and that is why this designation of a heritage area is so important for new jersey most notable in our history books of course is the famous crossing of the delaware by general washington and his men what happened at the crossing of delaware is a story that must be told again and again so all generations will know this military feat and the new life it gave to the american revolution by the winter of 1776 the war for independence was going badly general washington and his continental army had experienced defeat after defeat and retreated to pennsylvania for the winter it was brutally cold and morale was low many were losing faith in the leadership of general washington by late afternoon on christmas day 1776 over 2 400 troops began to cross the icy water of the delaware the weather made the operation difficult the troops were forced to fight their way through blinding winter weather the sleet and snow proved too much for two of the divisions to the south and general washingtons troops made the attack alone against all odds washington and his soldiers completed the crossing marched silently to trenton with cannon and on christmas night arrived taking the hessian garrison completely by surprise this engagement followed by the pivotal battle of princeton has been called the beginning of the winning military engagements were fought throughout new jersey and they gave the first glimpse to the world that the american people might succeed in this fight for independence in new jersey also there was the crossroads of ideas there were people loyal to the crown and those who were loyal to adams and washington and the other revolutionaries the difference was contested within families in towns and on farmsteads new jersey really was at the crux of the revolution the crossroads of the american revolution i became involved in this effort to establish the crossroads when i first came to congress in 1999 and with the guidance and leadership from historians and planners champions of open space preservation such as

like to turn to a matter of some significant concern to me and t6 the gentleman because as he said we both serve on the house armed services committee we both have worked diligently to see a good defense authorization bill put together this year and finally we thought put to bed last week but here is what is happening to everybodys dismay on this side of the line on thursday afternoon the house appointed conferees on the defense authorization bill to go to conference with the senate thursday afternoon within hours the conference committee met for the first and only time we made a cursory review which is all we had time for of the conference report which staff and mainly the republican members had worked up and put together over the last several weeks we reviewed it we reviewed the salient points we made some objections and finally we approved it this summary procedure is not my idea or i think the framers idea of how we would make law particularly law that authorizes the expenditure of 440 billion for something as important as the defense of this nation this kind of summary procedure should not be repeated this year we were late getting started the senate was even later getting started so we had to do it in record time and i am glad we got it done but it is not the best procedure as bad as that procedure is the worst was yet to come after the conference report had been signed signed by the democratic conferees signed by the republican conferees signed by the senate signed by the house after it had been signed the republican leadership decided it needed a mustpass moving vehicle some kind of bill to which they could attach legislation that otherwise could not be passed maybe would not stand the light of day reputedly it dealt with section 527 political advocacy corporations and campaign limits we suspected it also dealt witha bill known as pencewynn we do not know yet because we have not seen the conference report that they have tried to amend in any event we know this these bills are about campaign finance reform they have absolutely no thing to do with the defense of the united states this is not a technical change they are trying to make it is not even about defense far from it worse still it is fundamentally serious major legislation it is not something minor that you bobtail on or piggyback on another bill pencewynn if that is the legislation they are trying to append to this conference report is a major fundamental revamjing of the campaign finance laws of this country lifting the limits enormously on all kinds of corporations from pacs and individuals creating virtual carte blanche for the wealthy of this country to contribute to political campaigns our ranking member mr skelton of missouri heard what was happened to the extent that he could find out anything he protested and pulled our names on the grounds the house democratic names from the conference report on the grounds that they were amending or seeking to amend that the conference agreement that had been signed and sealed and all but delivered to the house floor for action amending it after the fact members ho were not even parties to the agreeent trying to change the bill in a significant way without any kind of collegiality any kind of comity any kind of consultation with our side he pulled our names in the senate the chairman of the senate armed services committee republican the very distinguished senator warner was so outraged to see this gross violation of the processes of the house the procedures of the house and the congress of fundamental fair play that he said if the republican leadership in the house tried to unilaterally change this agreement after it had been signed he would vigorously object and pull out the signatories at least on the republican side and mr levin the gentleman from michigan who is the democratic senator who is the ranking member of the senate armed services committee said the very same thing now we ask tonight what is the status of this bill that has taken months to produce that addresses our troops deployed all over the world that contains important personnel provisions that probably will not be overlapped in the appropriations bill where is the bill that we have worked and produced that we signed and had ready to go where is the bill where is the defense authorization bill where is it left if we do not take action on it it is left in limbo it is left hanging it is left unauthorized unpassed a hard effort coming to no worthy conclusion representative pryce who chairs the republican conference is quoted as saying in the cq daily that congress may not even consider this bill before christmas why not it is ready to go all we need is 1 hour on the floor it is written the conference report is ready to come to the floor why would we not consider it before christmas and more importantly what are the consequences if we do not consider it before christmas well

they are standing up for freedom let me just mention a few things that are not covered in the appropriation bill and may never come to pass if we do not pass this bill there is a 3 1 percent pay increase not a big increase but i am sure that every troop will be glad to get it there is an endstrength increase we think the ground forces are undersized so we have called for a couple of years for an increase in the size of the ground forces army and marines 30 000 in the army 4 000 in the marines in fiscal year 2006 that will not be done there is a death gratuity the conference report increases the death gratuity for all active and activated servicemembers up to 100 000 retroactive to october 7 2001 for the 2 100odd troops who have been killed in iraq and afghanistan in iraq in particular i am sure this would be welcomed by their families as some token of appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice they had to pay tricare for the first time ever reservists who agreeto continue service in the selected reserves will have an opportunity depending on their status to buy into the governmentsubsidized tricare standard health program for themselves and their families recruiting enlistment bonuses will expire unless we reauthorize it there is a whole list of things like this life insurance it was previously increased for servicemen life insurance sgli to 400 000 in amount we said in this bill if they are in iraq if they are in afghanistan if they are putting their lives on the line in a hazardous duty zone by golly as a part of their hazardous duty pay we will pay that first 150 000 i wanted to pay more of it but that will be a nice addendum a nice christmas present for the troops who are in the field and for their families back home who worry if our servicemember does not come home who will provide for us the least we can do is increase the life insurance i could go down the list with other personnel changes they are numerous let me give you just one this conference report would extend tricare coverage also for children of servicemembers killed in the line of duty until they reached the age of 21 this is just a sampling of what will not be done if for petty highhanded partisan reasons the conference report already finished on the defense authorization bill is not brought to the floor this is an outrage it is an outrage it is sort of inside baseball

of revocation so on the occasional though rare occasion where the gun dealers license is actually revoked for what is perceived to be a minor violation it generates perceptions of unfairness and breeds disrespect of the regulatory process if a violation is challenged the system perpetuates a further appearance of unfairness by using atf employees responsible to their supervisors to decide the

this is about today let me tell members what this is about this is about reforming programs that are important to the american people but they do not always work properly they do not always reach the people that the programs are intended to reach and these positive reforms which are a modest a tiny percentage of the 2 5 trillion that this government will spend next year more than 12 5 trillion over the next 5 years to save 50 billion is not a very big percentage i would say to my colleagues where is your plan to reform programs where is your plan to achieve savings what are you doing for the american people the american taxpayers and yes even the people who depend upon the programs that you claim to so strongly support and yet you will do nothing to protect the programs by putting in the reforms that are necessary i will tell you where their plan is it is locked up and i will tell you why it is locked up because what that plan primarily consists of is raising taxes on the american people the reason they want to raise taxes is because they are opposed to the effort to do what has done wonders for our economy in the last few years and that is to extend the tax relief that we have provided to stimulate the economy create jobs bring the unemployment rate below 5 percent and they have done nothing except wait in the wings to raise taxes on the people of this country that is what this is all about that is the party of spending they will not come forward with any savings that is the party of taxes the tax and spend democrats the same way they have always been that is why we are here today with a responsible plan in response to this abuse that they would sit here and attack modest reforms of important programs and suggest that as a result of that they can sit back with nothing and wait for the opportunity to raise taxes yet again on the american people the last time they were in power the last thing they did was to impose the largest tax increase in history on the american people and we should not ever allow them that opportunity again that is what they are trying to achieve here by bringing down this plan and they should not be allowed to succeed let me talk briefly in the time remaining about the reforms we have made in important programs under the jurisdiction of my committee first of all we have approached this across the board we have achieved fair savings in farm programs which keep the programs intact we have achieved savings in conservation programs that make those programs work better we have achieved savings in research for agriculture we have achieved savings in other areas that are important and yes we have also achieved savings from the food stamp program onehalf of 1 percent of the 180 billion that will be spent on food stamps in the next 5 years is what we are hopingto achieve it is less than onehalf of 1 percent it will affect less than 1 percent of the 24 million americans that receive food stamps and it is targeted at whom people who are not citizens of the united states who signed a document that said they would not become wards of the state and who by virtue of having been in this country for more than 5 years are eligible to apply for united states citizenship and avoiding the savings we are attempting to achieve by not giving food stamps to people who are not citizens of this country secondly we say that under the food stamp program if you are attempting to achieve food stamp benefits through a particular states programs you ought tp qualify for real welfare programs like the tanf program the bridge from welfare to work ought to be sustained but it ought not be abused by those who would do so those are the savings we want they are good reforms and we ought to pass them we are here today in a good faith effort to continue putting the nations fiscal house in order some have questioned the need or the degree to which mandatory spending should be reduced i would remind my colleagues that mandatory spending today takes up almost 55 percent of the total federal budget and if left on its current path it will within a decade consume 60 percent of the federal budget clearly it is unrealistic to think we can meet the pressing challenges facing our nation without reducing federal spending and redirecting priorities the house and senate agreed to reduce mandatory spending by 34 7 billion earlier this year to start reining in mandatory spending paying for hurricanes and other disaster assistancein addition to addressing the threat of international terrorism here and abroadhas necessitated targeted reductions in spending by all authorizing committees including agriculture eight house committees were instructed to put together a reform savings plan to reduce the growth in mandatory spending over the next five years to reduce spending and address some of the nations most pressing financial needs the committees were asked to do more and i am pleased to report that the committee on agriculture headed this call and reported out savings above the 3 billion we were originally asked to find from the beginning of this process it was the goal of the house agriculture committee that no single program should bear a disproportionate share of the spending reductions the committees final recommendations are balanced terms of the impact they will have on the many diverse interests that will be affected by this reform savings plan the agriculture committees savings plan includes an overall reduction in mandatory spending of 3 48 billion over five years fy0610 the savings package includes reductions in a variety of programs under the committees jurisdiction including commodity conservation energy rural development research and food stamp programs there are some who have suggested that food stamps take a disproportionate share of the spending reductions this is simply not the case while food stamps comprise nearly 60 percent of the agriculture committees mandatory spending they account for only 19 percent of the total savings under the package the proposed reductions account for less than a half a penny for every dollar spent on the food stamp program under the agricultures reform savings plan eligibility requirements are harmonized between federal assistance programs so that food stamp benefits go to those truly in need by tightening the categorical eligibility for some temporary assistance to needy families tanf recipients as well as the eligibility requirements for noncitizens this legislation ensures that the nations most needy will continue to receive this federal assistance when an individual enters the country to become a legal permanent noncitizen an affidavit is signed indicating that they will not participate in programs such as food stamps however this is not the reality under current law noncitizens are eligible for food stamps after five years of resident status the house agriculture committees savings reform plan extends this time requirement to seven years this provision will not affect children noncitizens noncitizens who are 60 years old and above and are currently receiving food stamp benefits on the date of enactment will not be affected additionally noncitizens who have submitted their citizenship application by date of enactment and currently receive food stamps would still be eligible to receive food stamps after five years noncitizen residents can apply for unitedstates citizenship if approved they can apply for food stamps immediately if someone chooses to remain a noncitizen that choice will result in a longer waiting period to qualify for food stamps it is essential that the house approves a reform savings plan while all government safety net programsincluding agricultureneed to be sustainable the burden of addressing the nations budget pressures needs to be broadly shared in order to be effective let me also say that in an ideal situation we would have had the support of the minority in moving this reform savings plan forward however in the absence of bipartisan cooperation it is incumbent on those of us who are privileged to serve in the peoples house

major legislation to the house floor before members have had a chance to find out the details of bills will do more to improve the legislative process and restore public confidence in this institution than will imposing new registration requirements on lobbyists or making staffers waste their timeat an ethics class i am disappointed but not surprised to see that congress is failing to go after the root cause of corruption instead we are considering placing further burdens on the peoples exercise of their free speech rights h r 4975 will not deter corrupt lobbyists staffers or members what h r 4975 will do is discourage ordinary americans from participating in the policy process among the ways h r 4975 silences ordinary americans is by requiring grassroots citizens action organizations to divulge their membership lists so congress can scrutinize the organizations relationships with members of congress the result of this will be to make many americans reluctant to support or join these organizations making it more difficult for average americans to have their voices heard is an odd response to concerns that congress is more responsive to special interests than to the american public this legislation further violates the first amendment by setting up a means of secretly applying unconstitutional campaign finance laws to section 527 organizations this is done by a provision in the rule under which this bill is brought before us that automatically attaches the 527 legislation to h r 4975 if h r 4975 passes the house andis sent to the senate for a conference h r 4975 also contains minor reforms of the appropriation process to bring greater transparency to the process of earmarking where members seek funding for specific projects in their respective district i have no objection to increased transparency and i share some of the concerns raised by opponents of the curreht earmarking process however i would like to remind my colleagues that since earmark reform does not reduce the total amount of spending instead giving more power to the executive branch to allocate federal funds the problem of members trading their votes in exchange for earmarks will continue the only difference will be that instead of trading their votes to win favor with congressional appropriators and house leadership members will trade their votes to get funding from the executive branch transferring power over allocation of taxpayer dollars from the legislative branch to the executive branch is hardly a victory for republican government reducing congresss role in allocating of tax dollars without reducing the federal budget also means state and local officials to say nothing of ordinary citizens will have less input into how federal funds are spent earmarks like most of the problems h r 4975 purports to deal with are a symptom of the problem not the cause the real problem is that the united states government is too big spends too much and has too much power when the government has the power to make or break entire industries by changing one regulation or adding or deleting one paragraph in an appropriation bill it is inevitable that people will seek to manipulate that power to their advantage human nature being what it is it is also inevitable that some people seeking government favors will violate basic norms of ethical behavior thus the only way to effectively address corruption is to reduce the size of government and turn money and power back to the people and the several states the principals in the recent scandals where not deterred by existing laws and congressional ethics rules why would a future jack abramoff be deterred by h r 4975 h r 4975 is not just ineffective to the extent that it burdens the ability of average citizens to

president currently fannie mae and freddie mac are the only two publiclytraded companies in the fortune 500 that are exempt from regulation by the sec the only reason fannie mae and freddie mac were forced to reveal their accounting errors is because in july 2002 under pressure from congress and the administration the two companies finally agreed to comply with certain reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 fannie mae followed through and registered in 2003 but failed to file a report in the third quarter of 2004 and is now in the process of restating those reports it did file freddie mac simply never lived up to the agreement i believe all publicly traded firms should play by the same set of rules and am pleased this legislation codifies the 2002 agreement this legislation should go even further by requiring fannie mae and freddie mac to comply fully with the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 regarding the powers of the new regulator due to the enornity of the gses holdings it seems to me we should go even further in empowering this new office economic experts most notably federal reserve board chairman alan grebnspan have warned this congress that the tremendous concentration of mortgage assets at fannie mae and freddie mac coupled with the dangers associated with interest rate risk may pose a systemic risk not only to the unitedstates capital markets but indeed the global financial system later today i intend to support an amendment to empower the regulator to reduce fannie and freddies mortgage assets if it determines these assets pose a systemic risk i oppose placing statutory orhard caps on the gses portfolios but consistent with the treasury departments recommendation it is prudent we provide the new regulator with the authority to consider systemic risk finally regarding the affordable housing fund despite my concern that creating this fund will only deepen the perception the gses are backed by the federal government those concerns are outweighed by the pressing need for more affordable housing in connecticut and around the country year after year we vigorously debate the amount of federal funds to allocate for public housing section 8 and other housing programs and it is my strong conviction that we must creatively address the affordable housing crisis it seems to me this fund is a worthy solution nonprofit organizations and social service providers in connecticut do an amazing job and are continually finding ways to do more with less but the needs are tremendous and

h r 479 corrects several florida mapping mistakes implemented in the enactment of the coastal barrier improvement act of 1990 under current law only congress can add or delete property from the coastal barrier resources system under the bill 20 acres of privately held land would be removed from the system ensuring that the affected homeowners are eligible for federal flood insurance in the future we would be making this change because this property was mistakenly included within an otherwise protected area unit it was designated based on the faulty assumption that this property was included within the boundaries of the grayton beach state park and that the land was undeveloped in fact a number of those lots were fully developed with homes constructed by 1983 and therefore this property does not qualify for inclusion in the system with the federal flood insurance program experiencing a large number of claims congress should be cautious about providing access to additional beneficiaries however in this case h r 479 satisfies the threshold of fixing legitimate mapping mistakes in addition the new corrected map will add almost 1 600 acres of state parkland that was

modest reforms to the occupational safety and health act these measures ensure that small business owners who make good faith efforts to comply with health and safety laws are dealt with fairly and equitably by the occupational safety and health administration nearly every employer recognizes that improving workplace safety is good for business and it is good for workers employers are subject to fierce competition both at home and abroad and must compete in the face of high taxes skyrocketing health costs escalating litigation and burdensome government regulations these osha reform bills are designed to improve worker safety and enhance the competitiveness of small businesses that are the real engine of job growth in our country the unitedstates economy continues to grow and more and more employers are continuing to hire workers each month last week the labor department reported that more than 3 7 million new jobs have been created since may of 2003 marking 25 consecutive months of sustained job creation but we need to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire new workers and compete in our economy that is why these bills are so important since republicans assumed leadership of congress 10 years ago we have undertaken considerable efforts to make bureaucracy more responsive and more accouintable to workers and taxpayers let me give just a few examples we stopped unwarranted and invasive osha regulations proposed by the clinton administration that would have held employers liable for the safety of their employees who work from home we stopped one of the most over reaching attempts at regulation in our nations history by repealing an irresponsible and unworkable ergonomics regulation that would have cost employers billions of dollars and killed millions of jobs we have dealt with the problem of costly unfunded mandates by ensuring that congress does not pass expensive legislation and then place it onto the backs of state and local governments this decade of progress on regulatory reform should give every american confidence that congress is making positive steps every year to improve government accountability and today we want to take one more step one more positive step to help improve workplace safety i think a goal we all share osha under the bush administration has made significant efforts to supplement traditional enforcement programs with cooperative partnerships between the agency and employers i am pleased to report these voluntary programs have proven successful in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses in fact if we look at this chart workplace injuries and fatalities have declined significantly during the bush administration and as this chart shows workplace injuries and illnesses have declined significantly under the bush administration to their lowest point in history to a rate of just five injuries or illnesses per 100 workers moreover workplace fatalities have made similar declines there has been a 5 8 percent reduction in workplace fatalities since the bush administration took office and that is significant progress why has such progress been miade because under this administration osha and employers have started to work together more cooperatively and more proactively to solve workplace safety problems before injuries and fatalities occur a gao report released last year said voluntary partnerships between osha and employers have considerably reduced the rates of injury and illness and have fostered better working relationships with osha improved productivity and decreased workers compensation costs we strongly support osha targeting the bad actors that defy the law and compromise the safety of their workers but we also need to recognize that most employers are good actors who work hard to address job safety concerns no employer wants to deal with unnecessary osharelated litigation and escalating attorneys fees that would result from that enforcement most employers want to comply with the law and the offer of assistance from osha is enough to provide the incentive they need to make this investment employers will use these resources because safety pays the reform measures we will consider today are proposals that while fairly modest in substance are important to small business owners who struggle every day to comply with the complex osha laws and provide a safe working environment for their workers while facing an increasingly competitive worldwide economy efhployers who make good faith efforts to comply with osha standards deserve to be treated fairly and have their day in court and these commonsense bills will help ensure that they receive that opportunity the first bill on tap today the occupational safety and health small business day in court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary 15day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason this bill essentially codifies administrative action taken by the labor department last year and ensures appropriate disputes are resolved based on merit rather than legal technicalities it passed the house with strong bipartisan support last year and it deserves

military operations except in accordance with article i section 8 of the constitution of the united states the intent of this is simple to prevent the president from committing unitedstates forces to additional wars without first coming to congress for a vote authorizing such military action if the president wishes or feels it is necessary to have a war with syria iran north korea or any other nation then under the unitedstates constitution and my amendment he must first come to congress some will try and argue that this would tie the hands of the president and the pentagon and the cia when it comes down to tracking down al qaeda my amendment would not impact the governments ability to hunt apprehend or kill members of al qaeda on september 18 congress adopted a broad authorization of force that says the president is authorized to use all necessary appropriate force against nations organizations and persons he determines planned authorized committed aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons referring back to the preceding list of countries if the president could demonstrate that any of them were involved in 9 11 he would not need further authorization from congress nor would my amendment impact on our ongoing military operations in iraq on october 16 2002 congress authorized those actions under the united states constitution further there are those who would say what about covert activities it is important to note that title 50 united states code section 413 already provides congressional authorization pursuant to amendments in 1980 to the national security act of 1947 for the president to authorize covert operations under certain circumstances on behalf of the united states h4772 co in other words if my amendment passes the president will still have all of the authorization from congress he needs to actively pursue al qaeda operations in iraq and other terrorist activities around the globe the amendment simply seeks to reinforce war powers granted solely to congress under the unitedstates constitution to ensure the president cannot launch a major war against iran syria tlorth korea or any other nation without a vote from congress some will say is that really necessary on april 18 2002 in response to a letter i and other members sent to the president about the need to authorize the war with iraq i received a letter from thenwhite house counsel alberto gonzalez now attorney general mr gonzalez stated that the president has broad constitutional authority as commanderinchief and as the sole organ of the federal government in foreign affairs to deploy the armed forces of the united states a formal declaration of war or other authorization from the congress is not required to enable the president to undertake the full range of actions that may be necessary to protect our national security that is an extraordinarily broad assertion not supported by a president after more than 200 years of interpretation of the constitution so i feel my amendment as narrow as it is is necessary to protect the war powers separation of the president as the commanderinchief the congress of the united states has the sole authority to declare war except in case of sudden attack upon the united states its citizens or armed forces ample opportunity exists for the president to continue to pursue al qaeda and others and the war in iraq under this amendment i urge my colleagues if they support that interpretation of the constitution which is broadly acknowledged by most legal scholars except mr gonzalez and i do not know if he is a legal scholar and would uphold our authority"],

i am the only one we know for sure has ipf e 1815 i am here to bring this resolution to the floor to talk about what this disease is what ipf is and to say it over and over again because that is how you get the word out i can speak from personal experiences that ipf is a serious lung disorder many may not know it but ipf is the most common form of interstitial lung disease i guarantee you most of us do not know that idiopathic and i have been asked this 1 000 times means that there is no known cause it is hard to cure something when you do not know what caused it pulmonary fibrosis has no cure or treatment however i wouldsay to my friend the gentleman from ohio having a new lung certainly extends ones lifetime and i am going to be here to argue with him a lot longer than the statistics say so do not give up i am going to be with you awhile with this disease a persons ability to breathe becomes increasingly restricted and it is painful and eventually of course it results in death as we review the legislation today and as we think about what we are actually asking to be done i want us to remember there are 83 000 americans today right now that are facing this painful reality of ipf and they all cannot get a lung i was blessed to have one but not everybody can unfortunately an unknown number above and beyond those 83 000 americans succumb to its fatal outbome without even knowing they have had ipf there is little awareness of ipf and it is often missed or underdiagnosed in this nation as the gentleman from georgia pointed out it is true in fact a recent study found that ipf may be five to ten times more prevalent than we previously thought it is unknown whether this increase is due to an actual spike in the occurrence of the disease or simply a previous lack of definite guidelines for diagnosing ipf even those who are properly and quickly diagnosed as i was fortunate enough to be must face the facts that the medium survival rate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients is 2 to 3 years i would say to the gentleman from ohio do not count on that i have a new lung i am going to be around a lot longer than that about twothirds of the ipf patients die within 5 years of developing the disease i am not going to do that i was blessed to have a new lung furthermore knowledge of this disease is hindered by very low public awareness awareness that is alarmingly low when compared to other less prevalent diseases a recent poll indicates only 29 percent of americans know the first thing about ipf half of which are familiar only with its name this resolution is a start it is an effort to make ipf idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis a wellknown name lastly i make a plea to all of americans and all of the families in america to consider being organ donors it is not simply a matter of simply deciding you will be a donor you must talk this over with your family at your kitchen table i want to talk to everyone about this donor list you cannot just be a donor it does not just work that way you have got to talk this over with your family and you have got to talk to them at your kitchen table god forbid if you or any of your family have to have this discussion in an emergency room that is not the place to have it my donor saved my life and four other lives a year ago october 5 this is important stuff that is affecting thousands of people it is worth doing but you must discuss this with your family on behalf of other ipf pa tients and others who are suffering i hope all americans will consider this and discuss and talk over being an organ donor
