29 of this year as i have indicated earlier on the floor i sent the chairperson of the armed services committee a communication suggesting that we expand the parameters of the discussion in the debate in the armed services committee in light of the fact that this administration has proposed a military budget in excess of 1 6 trillion in the first 5 years of the decade of the 1980s and with the fact that millions of american people and millions of people around the world are raising significant questions with respect to our lockedstep effort toward thermal nuclear war i felt that we had a profound obligation to go beyond the parameters of the armed services connittee to hear from other witnesses who had a positive and constructive alternative to our present military policies in this country and around the world the chair sent back a polite letter indicating that for a number of bureaucratic reasons they had an obligation to go forward with the military budget i understood that and responded to the chair by indicating that it was my belief that it is a moral imperative that we establish a platform to provide an opportunity for brilliant minds to come together to pose an alternative to americas present military and nuclear policy therefore in april of this year we held 6 days of hearings to look at the full implications of the military budget we looked at the national security and foreign policy implications of the military budget the tactical and strategic implications of the military budget and arms escalation versus arms control we looked at the economic implications and the moral implications of the military budget we looked at the economic implications of americas global arms sales and finally we looked at citizen responsibility in ending the absurdity and the insanity of our nuclear arms race and our rapidly escalating military budget a number of brilliant witnesses came to washington from all around the country to testify at these hearings i would like briefly to give a few highlights that a number of the witnesses presented during those hearings in april the first witness was former senator j william fulbright of arkansas former chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee from 1959 to 1975 senator fulbright led off the hearings he stated as follows and i quote this budget together with the propaganda to sell it to the public and the congress has the effect of shifting the focus of our policy from that of deterrence of nuclear war to the waging and the winning of a nuclear war further quoting he said this military budget is so large and the emphasis upon nuclear weapons so strong and the rhetoric about the soviet threat is so extreme that one cannot resist the feeling that we are preparing to fight and win a nuclear war i believe if this is the case that it is a dangerous game and could easily get out of control and lead to a disaster it is not only dangerous it is costly and it threatens the stability and the soundness of our domestic economy mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified as follows there is no basis in fact for the assertion that the soviet union has strategic nuclear superiority we lead in strategic warheads again it really doesnt matter but we have a lead we also lead when it comes to survivable forces mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and dis irmament agency there is no credible scenario in which we and the soviet unioh could fviht a nuclear war and have either one of us be declared the winner either one of us might come out somewhat better than the other but we would be worse off than uganda or bangladesh we would no longer be recognized as superpowers in fact the question is would we be recognizable as a national entity ms randy forsberg president and executive director of the institute for defense and disarmanent studies pulling the nuclear tripwire ever tighter by improving first strike capabilities is extremely risky and dangerous if we continue to make nuclear escalation in a first strike format easier and more likely then in a crisis it will become inevitable clearly the stakes in the third world are not worth the risk to the whole of humanity what in the extraordinary is the hubris the arrogance the almost criminal carelessness of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence that they can play nuclear chicken forever without ever losing control of the situation once dr paul p walker charter member of the boston study group and coauthor of the price of defense the defense department states boldly that this naval plan is based on the determi nation to restore and maintain maritime superiority over the soviets in order to wage severa wars worldwide against the soviet military empire such planning is based on several false assumptions one that we have somehow lost naval supremacy two that overwhelming maritime superiority enhances nationql se curity and three that aircraft carriers around which the current fleet is designed continue to be the most effective way to build and deploy

the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the first reading of the bill is dispensed with since the report on the bill has not been available for the required 3 days the rule waives clause 2 1 6 of rule xi againd consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing of these commemorative coins was in the judgment of the committee sufficient to move forward with the bill the banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all

marketing approach to the olympic coins mr annunzio is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage which reported by a 6 to 0 vote a procedure which varies signifi cantly from the procedure adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of

marketers selected through a process overseen by the treasury department and allowing for competitive bidding a 30 million guarantee to the olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are

countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial

weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me

effectively with the many crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual

leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things

showed such sensitivity to antitrust laws the next logical question is who will finance these forays into merger land now any eighth grader will tell you that it is better to use someone elses capital

perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and monitoring the information on a xetltime basis is this what those opposed to the sale want i do not think so but it is exactly what they are going to get let history judge which side of this debate best served the cause of freedom peace and security"], [0.8841140270233154,

budget for nasa we can work out the details in conference the new administrations proposal is outlined as follows the administration has agreed to add 30 million to aeronautics in each fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 without changing the total from the presidents budget the reductions in fiscal year 1982 would be taken by relatively minor reductions less than 1 percent 20 million from space shuttle and operations 7 million from space science and applications and 3 million for tracking and data acquisiton in fiscal year 1983 the administration would make a similar set of reductions in amounts of 14 million from shuttle operations 2 million from spacelab development and procurement 7 million from science andapplications 2 million from space research and technology and 5 million from tracking and data acquisition in light of the present status of the programs we believe these reductions can be made without serious program impacts the additional aeronautics money would be

tions of women we would not be able to obtain that type of equality under the law that this gentleman believed was so very necessary the argument that we do not need the era because there are no longer any discriminatory laws is completely wrong genderbased laws can be as picayune as the north carolina statute that requires a husband but not a wife to go to court for a legal name change if the couple wants to use a combined or hyphenated name or the laws can be reflective of deeprooted stereotypes such as the georgia law that states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife i subject ot him married women are the big losers property rights marital regulations provisions for separation and divorce and statutes concerning wills and intestate succession combine to discriminate against womenwhether they are homemakers work in a familyowned business work outside the home are widowed are divorced or getting a divorce so despite the many rights that women have won over the past decade equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law are incomplete and impermanent the rights we have gained could be revoked by changes in the political balance of congress administrative action or a realinement of the supreme court without the era in the constitution the shift of a few votes could wipe out equal employment opportunity equal access to credit and equal education many womens rights were enacted by small margins for example the law that gives a woman the right to sue an employer who discriminates against her would not be on the books if three senators had changed their minds the reason the era has not yet been ratified is because a few state legislators who ignored the wishes of their constituents and a vast majority of citizens throughout the country these legislators bottled the era up in committee tied it up by parliamentary maneuver and used backroom political pressure to defeat it but those days are past i expect the new erawith the

accountable i believe the era drive will be looked upon as the turning point in the womens movement women will move from being spectators to the inside political track i firmly believe that era more than anything else is a bread and butter issue for women 70 percent of the nations poor are women according to the national advisory council on economic opportunity this figure could rise to 100 percent before 2000 thp irony of this decade of advancement for women is that it has also been the decade of the feminization of poverty while this is most prevalent among elderly black and hispanic women the fastest growing segment of poor women are single white and ralsing children with no or little support jobs alone are not the answer while mens poverty is a consequence of unemployment womens is the result of occupational segregation in spite of the fact that more women are employed now than ever before 80 percent of these women are concentrated in traditional womens work service and cler

md is indeed in the metropolitan washington area it is all of approximately 10 minutes from the district of columbia line his defipition of metropolitan area is extraordinarily small if he maintains that largo is not indeed in the metropolitan area but notwithstanding that fact let me comment on the fact that the district of columbia convention center proposal did not move my friends from 1972 until 1978 and what was the impetus that made this proposal move it was that the state of maryland and prince georges county md proposed the placing of a convention center next to and in conjunction with the capital centre located at largo md the argument then ran as to the convention center in washington and still runs that the convention center would drew visitors from throughout the country and the gentleman from connecticut of course has reviewed the record90 percent of the debate in 1972 dealt with what a great facility the convention center would be for those who were going to come to washington and participate in the bicentennial and how there would be 80 buses traveling between the visitors center at union station which would have been of course funded by that time to provide a beautiful facility for bicentennial visitors that of course did not happen it is clear that the proposal for a convention center in maryland in 1977 which would have been located adjacent to the sports arena and obviously a complement to that arena was the impetus for the congress moving to fund the district of columbia convention center which clearly was also perceived to be complementary and not competitive to the capital centre we have supported that effort i continue to support that effort and will support that effort in the future however i might say that my friend from connecticut has observed that i have fought the good fight i want to let the gentleman know that i continue what we offered today as the gentleman knows was an agreement worked out between the district of

overwhelming bipartisan support in the judiciary committee provides the most effective way to continue the protections of the voting rights act of 1965 in particular i feel it is essential to support the section 5 preclearance provisions of the committee bill in its 16year history the voting rights act has proven to be the most important civil rights legislation ever passed by congress largely because of this law registration and voting by minority citizens has increased dramatically as has the number of minority elected officials the discriminatory practices of an earlier era have been largely eradicated and more and more americans are being given a real opportunity to exercise the most important right and responsibility of citizenship nevertheless the recurring theme in testimony by more than 100 witnesses before the committee was that threats to the political equality of minorities continue to exist for this reason i believe it is essential that congress approve the preclearance provisions of the legislation in a form which will make them effective and enforceable the committee bill provides that formit requires that those local jurisdictions with a proven history of voting discrimination seek d partment of justice approval bwfore making changes in voting laws extending the preclearance provisions to all 50 states would do irreparable damage to the laws effectiveness rather than making enforcement more equitable the amendment before the house would make the bill largely unenforceable in this time of programmatic and budgetary reductions the department of justice simply does not possess the resources to consider and investigate proposed voting law changes in every local jurisdiction nationwide the preclearance provisions of the committee

involvement in the lobbying to gain approval for the proposed procurement of the c5 the departments opting for the c5 over the c17 has been questionable from the start the c5 is a clearly inferior plane with a higher price tag and a terrible track record even its alleged earlier delivery date cannot justify the decision since a comparable fleet of 747s could meet our shortterm airlift needs at a savings of 4 to 5 billion the facts thus raise questions about the extent to which the decision was based on the goal of enhancing our national security or politics now we have learned that defense department practices in the c5 issue have extended into the lobbying area with press reportdand backup documentsrevealing the use of government funds and military personnel to coordinate an effort to urge members of congress to support the questionable c5 choice it is essential that we obtain all the facts pertaining to this possibility illegal effort this resolution of inquiry will help us answer these questions with the information thus obtained we might gain some better insight not only into the defense department lobbying activities but also how they arrived at the original decision to proceed with a bad program we will ultimately be in a better position to assess the military budget and make sure that the large sums we allocate to defense will truly enhance our national security

from the knowledge and insight of one of the best minds in congress i would also point out that after surviving these 12 years we have arrived at the point this year where i am the ranking republican on the committee and mo of course is the chairman one would think that with a conservative republican and a leader of the democratic party heading up the committee there would be a lot of infighting but i submit that the house committee on interior and insular affairs is one of the most productive committees in this body with one of the best legislative success records of the entire house i consider mo to be very largely responsible i consider him to be one of my very best personal friends the reason of course lies in the kind of man mo is as a colleague he is helpful as a chairman he is fair and as a friend he is loyal above all mo is the personification of the term gentleman his first 20 years in the congress of which tomorrow is the anniversary have set a standard of statemanship

as it relates to daht y legislation for the past 2 years dairy farmers have been frozen in terms of the amount that they receive on their milk check this provision in the reconciliation bill today means that as of october 1 of this year the secretary cf agriculture wihl have the authority to effectively reduce by 50 cents per hundredweight the effective income for dairy farmers by theimposition of an assessment against that milk check on first handling it also provides that on april 1 1983 the secretary will be given additional authority to provide an additional 50 cent reduction per hundredweight at that time one of the problems that i have with this proposal is that in addition to what it means to the income of the average dairy farmer in this country there is no effective and i underline the word effectivedistinction being made in this legislation between farmers who are overproducing and farmers who are not overproducing what it means in essence is that this legislation will not have any significant incentives to reduce production which many observers see is at the root of the problem i am not a lawyer but my brotherinlaw is he told me last weekend he has over the past years handled about four abstracts per year involving farm bankruptcies he is now up to about five or six a week and i would suggest to the members that with this provision that number is not going to go down that number is going to go up the cost of production for dairy products right now is higher than this bill will allow under the secretarys authority i would suggest any person from a dairy area to take a good look at it before he votes yes on final passage"], [0.002393662929534912, 0.4976063370704651, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in opposition to this amendment notwithstanding my great respect for the gentleman from ohio i strongly oppose the lukenlee professions exemption from ftc jurisdiction the luken amendment would exempt doctors dentists lawyers and scores of other professionals from ftc jurisdiction it is difficult to imagine a more objectionable piece of commercial legislation than an attempt to exempt professionals from the ftc the luken amendment would force both businesses and consumers to pay higher prices for all sorts of professional services the luken amendment would fan the flames of health care cost inflation at a time when americans already spend 287 billion annually or nearly 10 percent of the gnp on health care the luken amendment would be a burden on the federal budget driving up further the cost of medicare and medicaid most ironically the luken amendment would not be in the longrun interests of the professions themselves which would be tarred in the public eye as seeking a special status above the law the arguments advanced by the proponents of the exemption amendment are without merit the proponents say that protection of competition and of consumers raise issues of quality of service which are best left to the states this is a false issue the house should be aware that the vast majority of ftc enforcement activity has nothing whatever to do with the prerogatives of the states it is focused on private law breaking including price fixing boycotts and coercion what about the limited area where state laws are involved the states do not agree an exemption is desirable in a resolution adopted by the chief law enforcement officers of the states the national association of attorneys general opposed any reduction in ftc jurisdiction over the professions the proponents of an exemption also contend that the professions are different from other businesses because they deal with quality issues that the ftc cannot evaluate but the ftc has not pursued such matters it has dealt with garden variety commercial practices like price fixing and boycotts which no one should be permitted to engage in and which do not raise genuine quality issues for example the ftc has challenged physicians attempting to boycott health maintenance organizations it has attacked efforts to fix fees through boycotts of blue cross it has helped bring down the price of eye glasses and saved consumers millions by challenging restraints on advertising of eye wear and it has challenged deceptive advertising by health providers it is unthinkable that the public should be left unprotected against such practices it is offensive that some professional organizations should be fighting to shelter themselves from scrutiny for such conduct and yet it is this kind of enforcement that has unleashed a display of raw lobbying such as we have not seen in this town for a long time todays professional services simply bulk too large and the stakes in terms of equitable access are simply too high to permit removal of the means of maintaining public accountability we simply cannot enact a statute that makes the question of whether a person is subject to the principles of free and fair markets depend on whether he has gone to graduate school we work from the premise in this country that before the law the attorney is equal to the plumber the doctor equal to the mechanic on grounds of economy on grounds of

to congratulate him on his statement i think it is balanced and one with which i strongly agree i think it would be costly and complex and time consuming to make this change at this time and i think the gentlemans statement is right on target when the rousselot amendment was offered last october i voted for it so did 253 of my colleagues since that time i have done more homework on the issue i have concluded that i cannot support this amendment to the urgent supplemental appropriation i havealways believed that the free enterprise system cannot survive if it is entangled in excessive regulation but it also cannot survive if it fails to meet its responsibility to protect the safety and health of workers and that is the fundamental issue here how can we best protect the workers in surface stone sand and gravel mining the argument for this amendment is that with msha barred from using its funds to inspect and regulate certain surface mines osha will automatically have the authority to step in and fill the breach i know that my colleague from california mr rousselot can cite an impressive number of cases to try to show that this is so but i must point out that there are many doubts about this argument it has been suggested that under the rousselot language osha does not have the authority to take over from msha i do not pretend to have a definitive contribution to make in this debate but given the disagreements between honest men and women of good will i am certain of one thing the lawyers will have their hands full the losers will be the workers whose safety may be jeopardized so long as the matter is disputed as labor secretary donovan has written resolution of this litigation may take some time while this or any other issue is being litigated the contesting operator need not comply with an osra abatement order some of my colleagues have pointed out if the legal problems are so complex how come all that litigation hasnt surfaced yet the answer is that osha has not yet gone full speed ahead into mine inspection osha is only now attempting to take mshas place and we are feeling the calm before the storm when osha starts to inpsect in earnest industry and labor alike will be consulting their lawyers more often i recognize that a completely different scenario is possiblethere may be little or no litigation this could come about if osha is unable to take mshas place this would leave mines uninspected and workers unprotected when msha was inspecting surface mines there were over 1 800 inspections between january 1 and april 1 1981 in the same time period this year osha has performed only 17 inspections all of oshas were in response to complaints or fatalities there were no routine general inspections i know that secretary donovan has assured my colleagues that he will do his best to equip osha for the task of surface mine inspection my fear is that realistically he may not be able to achieve that goal the proposed rousselot amendment transfers many of mshas responsibilities to osha but none of its funding last december secretary donovan pointed out that this would be costly complex and time consuminginspectors would have to be trained new rules and regulations would have to be promulgated and inspections would have to be scheduled and madeall within oshas present resources last december these obstacles were so worrisome that secretary donovan said he did not think osha should take over mshas surface mining responsibilities the possible outcomes then are not very appealingwe face legal problenis over oshas authority to regulate surface mines and administrative problems involving oshas ability to enforce that authority if indeed it exists i am afraid that despite good intentions all around the safety of workers may be at risk if this amendment is adopted and where human lives are at stake i do not think we can afford to take chances i urge my colleagues not to adopt tills language"],

massachusetts and the gentleman from virginia this legislation is long overdue i think they have done a great job i certainly hope the members will give it the strongest support because we need this kind of legislation on the statute books the primary purpose of this measure is to enhance the protection of unitedstates intelligence operatives working under cover such legislation is of compelling urgency as there are individuals including former unitedstates intelligence officials who are busily and systematically engaged in efforts to destroy our intelligence capability by disclosing the identities of those clandestinely employed by the various unitedstates intelligence agencies an episode in jamaica illustrates what i am talking about in july of last year the homes of our embassys first secretary in jamaica and an aid employee were fired upon shortly after the american editor of covert action information bulletin claimed in a press conference that these unitedstates officials and 13 other americans as well as jamaicans were connected with the cia not only were tie names of these individuals disciosed but also their home addresses telephone numbers and auto license tag numbers fortunately unlike the cia station chief in athens who was killed in december 1975 after his cover was blown in a similar fashion by the migazine counter spy the american officials and families involved in tile kingston attack survived unscathed it was a close call however as twvo of the bullets penetrated the bedroom window of one of the children who was providentially away at the time with that as backdrop it is little wonder that our human intelligence collection efforts are in serious jeopardy around the world selfpreservation is a very basic instinct and wvhy should anyone want to be associated with an intelligence community that cannot provide adequate protection for those it asks to undertake dangerous assignments of significant national se curity import in evaluating the merits of this legislation i find former cia director william colby especially persuasivr when he while participating in an american enterprise institute panel discussion of intelligence matters observed that the journalists believe they should protect their sources i think our nation should protect its sources we need a discipline over our employees to make sure that when they undertake to keep the secrets they are going to learn whien they go to work for inteiiigence they darn weli keep them if they violate that trust they should be subject to criminal action there are thirtyodd statutes in our criminal code that punish government officers for revealing information they learned during the course of their workthe agricultural department employee who reveals the crop statistics for example and a variety of others our natioival secrets and the officers who serve their country are entitled to that same protection from someone who reveals them the soldier does not mind the enemy shooting at him but he certainly does not want a fellow american shooting at him the intelligence officer does not mind thle threat and the danger from the enemy or the foreign country but he cannot accept thle possibility that some american can freely reveal is name and endanger him finally i would like to address briefly the first amendment questions of this bill that have been raised by somec of my colleagues especially with respect to criminalizing disclosures of undercover intelligence identities by individuals who have never been affiliated with the unitedstates government of special concern in this regard are journalists this bill was drafted with great care and sensitivity to this issue and i believe has resolved it in a responsible and constitutionally acceptable manner such individuals can only be prosecuted under this legislation when it can be clearly demonstrated that the disclosure occured in the context of a practice of identification and disclosures intended to impair unitedstates intelligence capabilities this means that to be criminally culpable one would have to be engaged in the business of naming names like the publishers of the aforementioned covert action information bulletin or counter spy this approach makes eminently good sense and is consistent with the point made by justice oliver wendell holmes in the famous espionage act decision of 1919 thatthe first amendment 0 obviously was not intended to give immunity for every possible use of language 0 the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic also very relevant in this connection are the remarks of zechariah chafee a leading defender of free speech during his 37 years at the harvard lawv school and the uncle of the distinguished senator from rhode island who introduced the senate version s 391 of this bill in a book entitled free speech in the united states the elder cliafee wrote that the true boundary line of the first amendment can be fixed only when congress and the courts realize that the principie on which speech is classified as lawful or unlawful involves the balancing against each other of two very important social interests in public safety and in the search for truth every reasonable attempt should be made to maintain both interests unimpaired and the great interests in free speech should be sacrificed only when the interest in public safety is really imperiled and not as most men believe when it is barely conceivable that it may be slightly affected in war time therefore speech should be unrestricted by the censorship or by punishment unless it is clearly liable to cause direct and dangerous interference with the conduct of the war thus our problem of locating the boundary line of free speech is solved it is fixed close to the point where words will give rise to unlawful acts in sum what we have before us is practical commonsense legislation that addresses a problem of paramount national security importance while carefully insuring no genuine civil liberties are infringed upon i therefore urge its immediate passage it is the least we can do for those who literally put their lives on the line for us"]]}
