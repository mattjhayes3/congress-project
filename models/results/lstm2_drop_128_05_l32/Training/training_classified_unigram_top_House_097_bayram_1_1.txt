side of the aisle that reaganomics is not working that the republicans are the party of high interest rates and that inflation is not coining down and that there is no productivity that is exactly the opposite of what is happening we have here a few figures which i think the members will find very enlightening in 1976 in the last year of a republican administration under president ford the inflation rate by the consumer price index was but 4 8 percent by 1977 it had climbed to 6 8 percent by 1978 it had climbed to 9 percent by 1979 it had climbed to 13 3 pecent and by 1980 it had reached 12 4 percent in 1081 it is expected that the inflation rate will end up being about 9 5 percent and in 1982 it will drop further into the low 8s or the high ts that is a dramatic change in direction from the direction we had been going in over the previous 4 years of rapidly rising inflation rates we have turned the corner and inflation has started to come down if we look at productivity we see that over the last 4 years productivity has had an absolutely abysmal record in 1976 the last year under a republican administration productivity as measured by output per hour had climbed by 3 3 percent in 1977 productivity only increased 2 1 percent in 1978 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 2 percent in 1979 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 3 percent and in 1980 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 2 percent it is projected that for 1981 productivity will grbw by 1 4 percent this is the first year in 5 years that productivity has grown and not gone down that is a dramatic turnabout in productivity the republicans are quite often right now accused of being the party of high interest rates that is just not the case at all if we look at what happened to interest rates in the last 5 years we find that in 1976 the average 3month treasury bill rate for the calendar year was 5 percent in 1977 the average rate was 5 3 percent in 1978 the average rate was 7 2 percent in 1979 the average 3month treasury bill rate was 10 percent in 1980 the average 3month treasury bill rate was 11 5 percent and on january 1 1981 the 3month treasury bill rate was 14 7 percent under the last auction that came out yesterday the 3month treasury bill rate had fallen to 11 1 percent for the first time in 5 years we see the treasurybill rates going down not going up if we look a~t the real gross national product growth we see that in 1976 real gnp climbed to 5 4 percent in 1977 the real gnp growth climbed 5 5percent but from that point on gnp went down in terms of growth rates 4 8 percent in 1978 3 2 percent in 1979 in 1980 a negative rate of 0 2 percent it is projected that in 1981 the year we are in now we will have a real gnp of 9 1

been widely characterized as abuses while leaving intact the structure of safe harbor leasing that was designed to allow our basic capital intensive industries to benefit from the tax depreciation rules we enacted in 1981 for needed new plants and equipment since last fall we have been inundated with sensational press accounts of a few extraordinary leasing transactions these perceived abuses generated many calls to repeal the safe harbor rules the rhetoric has waned sufficiently to allow the purpose and results of the safe harbor rules to be more fully examined as a result recent discussion has centered on how best to reform the rules to eliminate abuses rather than to repeal the rules even more recently there have been suggestions that safe harbor leasing can be reformed by codifying into law a series of bureaucratically created irs requirements for a leverage lease transaction that existed prior to 1981 such an actioneven if one or two of the old irs rules were modifiedwould mean repealnot reformof the safe harbor leasing rules and a return to old law and damage to those industrial corporations which need to leasefinance their capital equipment in deciding to introduce this measure i took into account the following major factors first leasing is not new the traditional leverage lease that involves the lessee the equity lessor and a debt lender has been a widely used means for transferring tax benefits for many years therefore the 1981 act did not create the ability to shift tax deprecation deductions from one company to another second safe harbor leasing is substantially more beneficial to an intended beneficiarythe lessee which is the industrial or transportation company investing in capital equipment the old irs rules on leverage leasing imposed a series of strigent requirements that often resulted in the lessee the real operating company having a relatively small portion of the financial benefit of the transaction that involved its assets a range of 20 percent to 40 percent of such benefits was common as much as 50 percent was virtually unseen large percentages conversely went to equipment lessors brokers lawyers and accountants treasurys intitial analysis of information returns for 1981 safe harbor transactions indicates that as much as 84 percent of the financial benefit went to lessees 15 percent to lessors and only 1 percent to brokers lawyers and accountants thus under the safe harbor leasing rules the intended beneficiaries are receiving major benefits while the transaction is still sufficently attractive to create a large pool of lessors third as i emphasized earlier a return to the old rules would be repeal not reform by definition replacing the existing safe harbor rules with prior rules is a repeal of the current rules proposals to codify the irs revenue procedures on this mattereven those making modificationsconstitute a return to old law lessees who need to finance their capital equipment purchases plus some companies that are using safe harbor leasing to sell their products on an installment basis to farmers and small businesses at lowinterest rates are supporting actively the bill i

retirement income challenges of this nation in the 1980s and beyond an identical measure is being submitted today in the other body by senators nickcles and wallop our national pension system is at a crossroads the present means of delivering retirement income will be faced with far greater demands in the future barring significant changes in our national pension policy each of the three major components in the delivery or retirement incomeemployersponsored pension plans social security and individual savings and investmentwill be hard pressed to meet the retirement income needs of our nations working men and women the expansion of private pension coverage and benefit levels has been stayed for the moment due to uncontrolled inflation slower economic growth and to a lesser extent the effects of erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the demographics of the future cast doubt on health of the social security system it is difficult to foresee how current levels of support can be maintained yet far too many workers already depend on social security benefits as their sole source of retirement earnings on the other hand individual incentives for personal retirement savings and investment are not emphasized enough new inducements will be necessary to encourage individual retirement intiatives particularly during this era of shrinking disposable income when this aspect of retirement planning is the first to be dismissed the retirement income incentives and adminstrative simplification act of 1981 sets forth the necessary blueprint for building on the strengths and correcting the weaknesses of our present system of providing retirement income by preserving our private pension system and strengthening it through tax incentives and other means the bill sets the stage for expanded capital formation and increased productivity in the 1980s and beyond which will lead to greater retirement income security for all of americas workers and their families title i of the bill establishes the employee benefit adminstration eba a single independent agency to consolidate federal regulation with respect to employee pension and welfare benefit plans the eba is charged to carry out a newly stated national policy under erisa to first encourage the establishment and growth of employee benefit plans and second encourage savings to meet the needs of employees and their families in the event of death disability or retirement title ii permits federal income tix deductions for employees whu aupplement their employersponsored pension with individual contributions to their plan or an individual retirement account ira experience in canada under a similar provision suggests that nearly onethird of individuals earning 15 000 or more will expand their

experienced with respect to lumpsum distributions rollovers and tax qualification the contribution limits to h r 10 self employed plans are doubled the policy to allow plans to coordinate benefits

liquidation should render moot the current discussion in pension accounting circles as to any need for pension fund liabilities to appear as an item on the balance sheet of sponsoring employers in

on the house steel caucus executive committee to discuss the concerns and continuing problems facing the domestic steel industry the main reason for this special order today is to focus on the situation created by massive dumping of steel into this countrys markets at the expense of thousands of domestic jobs when you realize that foreign imports result in one steelworker out of work every 9 minutes of every day of 1981 including sunday and holidays it puts the picture into agonizing perspective right away i represent an area dependent on the health and vitality of the american steel industry and am proud to have the bethlehem steel headquarters located in my congressional district pennsylvania 15th we have seen significant relief provided to revitalize the steel industry over the last year for example congress passed a steel stretchout bill which extends the compliance date to meet clean air act mandated environmental standards for steelmaking facilities in order to spur modernization this bill which was signed into law last july was supported by labor industry and environ mental groups it is interesting to note that despite their financial difficulties the nations steel companies have increased their rate of modernization a dramatic number of new projects have been announced or undertaken during the last year despite the generally unfavorable economic environment at the same time the steel industry has made progress in cleaning up the environment since the key environmental laws were enacted most of the steel industrys major pollution sources have been brought under control at the end of 1979 the steel industry was controlling 98 percent of its airborne particulate emissions and 91 percent of its water pollutants by 1982 as required by the clean air act the steel industry will be removing 96 percent of its airborne particulate emissions by 1984 under require ments in the dean water act the industry would control over 99 percent of its water pollutants this year the steel industry also enjoyed significant tax reform as the congress passed the taxincentive act of 1981 this measure included the much desired and needed capital cost recovery act the new law replaces the present asset depreciation range system adrs with accelerated cost recovery system acrs this will allow steel industries to write off their assests over a period of 3 5 10 or 15 years in addition the new law raises the regular investment tax cr~dit for used property to 125 000 for 198184 and to 150 000 in 1985 extends the carryover period of unused investment credit to 15 years and provides an election to expense the cost of new or used personal property depreciation rules for leased assets are also liberalized in order to encourage profitable businesses to lease assets to distressed industries who would not benefit from acrs because they have mord tax deductions than taxable income this liberalization will enable unprofitable firms to modernize their plant and equipment under the new rules businesses that grant such leases may borrow up to 90 percent of the cost of the assets and remain eligible for the depreciation allowance all of these depreciation provisions are retroactive to january 1 1981 unfortunately with all the advantages this new direction has provided because of the massive imports pouring into this country the industry is still fighting to keep its head above water in the words of chairman of bethlehem steel corp donald h trautlein on the october 1981 steel import levels it is obvious from the october figures that steel imports are still a major problem for american steel producers more than 1 87 million tons of steel came into the united states in october and took over 22 percent of the domestic steel market while steel imports continued at the high levels of recent months the domestic steel industrrys rate of capacity utilization last week fell below 60 percent as a result operations have been reduced and over 50 000 american steelworkers remain on layoff the loss of business to enormous tonnages of dumped and subsidized foreign steel is intolerable and must not be allowed to continue mt~ speaker i share the concerns and sentiments of mr trautlein with regard to the impact of foreign imports on the domestic steel industry the american steel industry supports an open world trade system foreign steel should have an opportunity to compete in the american steel market so long as it is fairly traded the industry has been a supporter of the tokyo round trade agreement involving more than 100 countries which reduced tariffs and promoted efforts to remove nontariff barriers domestic steelmakers believe they are the principal lowcost producer for the american market but the united states the only major open steel market in the world cannot ignore the penetration of unfairly traded imports heavy flows of such imports cripple the domestic industry and undermine its capability to continue as the principal supplier of steel for this market steel companies are making progress in their efforts to modernize and become more competitive government policies appear to be headed in a direction which could speed progress however what has been done is merely the beginning much more needs to be daneby the steel companlies through the installation of more modern facilities and by government in the form of policy changes unfair steel imports transfer to american steel producers and workers the unemployment and adjustment problems that foreign producers and their governments are seeking to avoid enforcemrent of the unitedstates trade law through the trigger price mechianism tpm is the most effective answer to the problem and is essential to the industrys revitalization pro gram recently

single am radio station cuba can completely block the signal from reaching the island the state and defense department have said so as have the fcc the ntia and the ica that being the case to invest 10 million in radio marti in its present form would be a total waste of the publics money there is a better way the time proven method used by international broadcasters to overcome jamming is to broadcast on multiple frequencies as the house committee on government operations found in its december 11 1981 report on international broadcasting multiple frequency broadcasting gives the jammer more to deal with and increases the possibility that listeners will be able to tune in an audible signal there is a strong argument to be made that cubans would be more likely to listen to existing am stations than to radio marti there are a number of stations from the united states and from other caribbean countries that can be heard very well in cuba in fact there are at least two very worthy precedents for this type of paid rebroadcasting after 1962 wobs wkwf in key west wwl in new orleans radio caribbean from the dominican republic transmitted programs prepared by the cuban freedom committee founded in washington by representative roman pucinski who believed that cubans had been brainwashed with a hate america campaign and thereafter they responded by taking money and buying

talking about these stationswckr wgbs wmie all from miami wsb in atlanta wgn in chicago wwl in new orleans wcky in cincinnati wrul in massachusetts wgel in belmont calif the last two being shortwave

the bib prepare the material in any way that they want to take the money and buy time on commercial radio stations buy it on winz radio in miami or wqba or wwl or any other radio station that would be willing to broadcast to cuba and i guarantee my colleagues if given the money to buy the time they will broadcast and rather than having castro try to jam just one frequency he is going to have 10 or 15 frequencies out there beaming into cuba so i submit if members really want to get a message across to cuba support this amendment no 1 it will be a volunteer effort by radio stations to go ahead

committee makes it perfectly clear that the feasiblility study report should contain the type of detailed information relating to the effects the proposed project might have on wildlife habitat that

from colorado and the others for arranging this special order marking the start of a new campaign to give women and men equal protection under the law today with the reintroduction of the equal rights amendment we recommit ourselves to the struggle for equal rights two weeks ago as the deadline for era ratification passed we were just 3 states short of the 38 needed to make it the 27th amendment to the constitution the disappointment was deeply felt by everyone who had been involved in working for its passage the era opponents rejoiced apparently presuming there had been a death but i believe their celebration was premature and i know it will be shortlived they have failed to grasp a fundamantal realitythat the efforts to pass this amendment will not cease until it becomes part of the constitution the reservoir of public support for equal rights is deeper now than ever before polls consistently show that twothirds of americans favor passage of the era public support and understanding of the need for era is just one of the benefits reaped in this decadelong struggle among the era forces there is a heightened political sophistication a keener understanding of the opposition and a resolute determination to continue fighting on other fronts as well as the era drive the first focus will be to defeat the opponents of equal rights in addition lawsuits and boycotts will be directed against corporations that practice sex discrimination meanwhile the era opponents are still claiming that the era is not needed because women can win equality through federal laws already on the books and changes in state and local statutes but no statute can provide the allencompassing protection of a constitutional amendment statutes can be repealed or undermined a lesson we are learning only too well under this administration support for equal rights can disappear as quickly as changes occur in the white house the congress or the state legislatures currently we have a president who pays lipservice to womens rights but works actively to subvert the gains women have made nothing so dramatizes the need for era as the administrations pathetic record on equal rights antidiscrimination laws such as the title ix prohibition on discrimination in federally funded education programs are being weakened social programs that seek to equalize opportunity for women in employment education housing and other areas are being reduced or eliminated fewer women are being considered for judicial and federal appointments than under past administrations women cannot even rely on existing statutes to protect them the equal pay act for example was passed in 1963 but women are still paid less than men for doing the same work in every job classification in the labor force college educated women on the average earn less than men with an eighth grade education poverty has increasingly become a female phenomenon two out of every three poor adults are women era is not just for women in the labor market fulltime homemakers will benefit from it as well since discrimination against women is still rampant in our tax and retirement systems insurance policies family law and other areas moreover by eliminating sex as a factor in determining legal rights for all citizens the era will protect men as well as women a man should not be denied the opportunity to learn nursing for example any more than a women should be denied the opportunity to learn engineering family law and criminal law should not treat men more harshly than women the era in its simplicity offers the best argument for itself equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex i am confident that those words will become part of the constitution before another ratification deadline has passed"], [0.4177107810974121, 0.9177107810974121, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i merely want to remind the gentleman from michigan

the enforcement of the nuclear nonproliferation act of 1978 they are doing many other very worthwhile things in research and development at this facility i would urge my colleagues at this time to

myself such time as i may require in the history of our great country i do not believe any group has faced the problems that we have within the house during the current year we have been faced with the budget of the outgoing president the original budget of the new president the rescissions and amended requests along with the serond budget and periodically we have had other things that intervened with our normal procedures notwithstanding that your committee on appropriations in the house has proceeded with its hearings we have not yet finished this year but we had about 10 000 witnesses in the last congress and it has gone along pretty much the same way this year we have passed nine of our bills and may i say that we are some 3 900 million below the budget request in the bills that we have dealt with that is in terms of new budget authority notwithstanding all of this and the fact that we have sent the bills to our colleagues on the other side none of those bills are enacted into law it leaves us where under the opinion of the attorney general of the united states of a few years ago unless we act tonight and unless the other body goes along with us and we get the bill signed by the president most of the government would come to a close beginning in the morning so we bring you tonight a continui resolution that will continue the operations of the various departments in connection with that the departments will operate under the time limit that we have set with one exception in one bill they would operate under the continuing resolution until november 20 now our colleagues on the other side of the capitol have a weeks holiday that is already provided in that period so where we had provided that the continuing resolution last until november 1 the agreement in the conference was that it go to november 20 the rate at which the departments will be operated will be by and large as they have up until now but generally the rates of operation are those as provided for in the continuing resolution as it passed the house so in carrying out the record that we have made through the year of holding our appropriations below the budget this continuing resolution will continue to hold spending at the levels that are below the budget recommendation in toto later in my remarks i will go into more detail but let me repeat to you again that i am proud of this record which has escaped the attention of the press and just about everybody else but this congress in trying to cooperate with our president on his request that we cut 15 1 billion in the relatively few months left of the fiscal year your committee recommended and you voted for and we passed on june 5 a bill which cut 14 3 billion of the 15 1 billion in rescission that had been requested not only that but we cut over 1 5 billion in supplementals requested by the president so we were under his total figures this was done with a minimum of dislocation because in the committee we assigned the items to each subcommittee familiar with the subject so we start off with a splendid track record with your help we recommending and you approving what we have done so tonight in behalf of the conferees we bring you a continuing resolution which is i think another step showing that we can act when we need to and certainly we need to now when most of the government will come to a close beginning tomorrow morning unless we act tonight"], [0.4481123685836792, 0.9481123685836792, 1, "i rise in support of h r 6113 this legislation reflects a carefully designed compromise worked out by members of both the merchant marine and fisheries committee and the committee on public works and transportation i do not believe the measure is controversial and i hope that it will be approved without difficulty today during the course of debate on this legislation within the committee on merchant marine and fisheries i offered an amendment to provide a more specific definition of the term montto ing this definition was later the subject of discussions between the two committees but the final language retains the purpose of the amendment as it had originally been proposed the purpose of the amendment quite simply is to increase the likellhood that we will learn the effects of what we are doing in the ocean in a manner sufficiently timely to permit us to alter our activities if necessary to prevent longterm or irreversible damage to vitally important resources the definition of monitoring contained in the bill is intended to guarantee the development of a flexible but comprehensive program of monitoring using a broad range of data collection options it will also facilitate the development of more uniform monitoring practices throughout the environmental protection agencys national structure than has been possible in the past finally i believe that this revised definition of monitoring is necessary to keep faith with the public we have an environmental protection agency we have a requirement for the monitoring of dumpsites the public ought to be able to derive from these facts a sense of confidence that the environmental effects of ocean dumping will be carefully observed and that these observations will play a major role in any decision to continue permitting such dumping this amendment is designed to improve the chance that

recognition of the baltic states on june 14 1940 during the early days of world war ii the soviet union fulfilled its end of the bargain struck in the infamous molotovribbentrop act of august 1939 the soviet army marched into the baltic republics violating the neutrality of these nations and effectively sealed the nations of estonia latvia and lithuania f from the prying eyes of western iedia and the governments of the west in lithuania alone the soviets used more than 300 000 troops along with armor and aircraft that is one soldier for every 12 inhabitants of the country the soviets immediately formed a puppet regime and called it the lithuanian peoples government the legislature now dominated by communist party members petitioned the supreme soviet of the unitedstatess r to incorporate lithuania and the soviets were ready to complyon august 3 1940 lithuania was designated a soviet republic estonia and latvia were also summarily dealt with and became soviet republics i am proud that the united states government has consistently refused to recognize such a blatant violation of international law it is not just a matter of principle but also a matter of public education that we continue our diplomatic recognition of the baltic states it has been 42 years since the soviet union perpetrated this great fraud against their neighbors an entire generation has been born and grown up without any first hand experience or memory of world war il it is therefore essential that the public be reacquainted with the events of the last european war time has not altered the basic principle that a great injustice was committed and remains unsettled although we cannot bring about a resolution now a time will come when the baltic states will be able to rejoin the family of independent nations this latest period of foreign occupation and domination is just an interlude in the long history of the estonians latvians and lithuanians during some centuries the baltic peoples lived freely and during some they suffered the iron hands of foreign tyrants it is interesting to note that lithuania has in the past enjoyed a longer period of freedom and independence than our nation has existed fiercely independent in their thinking and very stubborn i have no doubt that the baltic nations will see an end to soviet repression in the meantime the united states must do its share to keep the issue of baltic independence on the agenda of world politics the people of the baltic nations are doing their part in resisting sovietization and russification of their national character their belief systems their democratic spirit nations made up of small industrious farmers the baltic states before the outbreak of world war ii would have seemed familiar and comfortable societies for thomas jefferson and john adams everyone had a stake and interest in developing their societies and raising their standard of living as soon as the soviet army arrived and the incorporation was declared the soviets began a systematic campaign of violence against the populations of these nations the soviets needed to wipe out any opposition to the new order and to consolidate their position in the newly acquired territorles by way of note we know from soviet maps captured during world war ii that the soviets had designs on the baltic states long before they actually invaded those countries over 665 000 estonians latvians and lithuanians were deported to siberia and thousands more killed in the war with the baltic guerrillas who took to the forests to establish a network of armed opposition to the soviets of course more people were killed when the front changed and nazi germany invaded her old ally the soviet union so many people were lost during the war that the baltic countries are only now regaining the population figures they had before the war of course the population mix has changed and the nations are in threat of being swamped by settlers from other soviet territories when the soviets returned the second time in 1944 they were determined to stay and began a brutal plan of collectivizing the countryside farmers were forcibly evicted and deported more troops than ever were brought in to destroy the guerrilla movement even so the partisans continued their struggle until the early 1950s when isolated by numerous div sions many in the resistance movement gave up their arms in an amnesty program offered by the soviets over the years the baltic peoples have found their own ways to resist the soviet plan to alter their historic paths of economic and social development cne of the institutions which has grown up to be a real thorn in the side of soviet rule has been the chronicle of the catholic church in lithuania and the church of the catacombs which it represents the chronicle has managed to publish a record of soviet violations of religious freedoms for 10 years now it is true samizdat literature being copied by hand or on type writers and circulated to whoever will risk wrath of the soviets as the ranks of the leadership are thinned by kgb arrests and prison sentences new people step forward to carry on the work of the chronicle the helsinki watchdog committees in the baltic also attest to the gutsiness of their peoples there are presently over a thousand batlic political prisoners known to western sources we cannot abandon these people they have already demonstrated their determination for freedom and their willingness to do what is necessary to keep their national characters intact the least we can do is remind the world that there once were free and independent states on the eastern coast of the baltic sea e"]]}
