from harvard to boston college to mit to stanford to rice and none of them came up with a 60 percent tax rate guess who did a committee whose members have their entire political capital invested or their intellectual capital invested in the tax code they would lie to get this thing defeated because we have depreciated their intellectual capital if we get rid of all the income taxes and all the difficulties and the taxes are transparent and easy to understand they will not be needed any more if we get rid of this tax code with a single transparent straightforward simple sales tax americans will know what it costs every time they buy something what it costs for government what they are not telling the american public is that currently as the gentleman from ohio pointed out we know that 22 to 25 percent according to various studies of what taxpayers currently pay for at retail is the current embedded cost of this tax system they would rather have a hidden tax than a transparent tax because they know if taxpayers saw how much government was costing them they would rebel and ask us to reduce the role of government in their lives we are currently paying it it is hidden they like that this income tax was originally intended and promised to only tax the top 2 percent of the income earners in america that was the promise that was made in 1913 and indeed if we think back to the last two tax increases 1990 and 1993 the promise was made we are only going to raise the taxes on the top 1 percent well guess what in 1990 the top 1 percent paid 106 billion in taxes and after the tax increase on them the following year they paid 100 billion because rich people are often smart people they can find ways to rearrange their income but each of these tax increases that these folks so love reverberates through the system and we all pay we all pay all we want is to get rid of a monstrosity that no one understands that confuses every taxpayer and keeps hidden what the actual cost of government is and then let us have a debate on what to replace it with it may not be my tax bill perhaps it will be the bill offered by the gentleman from texas or the gentleman from ohio or the gentleman from louisiana but it will be simpler more understandable and it will be fairer one of my favorite stories about the 1913 debate on the 16th amendment to impose the income tax was that one of the senators was ridiculed and laughed off the floor of the united states senate for saying something absolutely outrageous he said this mark my words before this is over the government will be taking 10 percent of everything you earn it was considered so outrageous by his colleagues that they ridiculed him off the floor of the senate i feel certain that is what gave fresh meaning to my

we are collecting more in social security receipts than we need for benefits so whatdo we do with it do we give it to the secretary of the treasury to put under the mattress no those excess dollars are invested in treasuries interestbearing treasuries the interest income goes back into the trust fund it is just like us taking our dollars our hardearned dollars and putting them in a bank we can

do and anytime we come to withdraw those funds the bank will have other revenues other mortgage payments other loan payments to give us our money back and that is what the current system is doing

amendment we cannot play it straight on anything this amendment should not be politicized what we should be doing with this amendment is to provide every single dollar that we need to conduct the operations now going on in kosovo we should not provide one dime less and neither should we try to use this to play games on the budget i am baffled by the fact that last week this house declined to support the operation that is now going on in kosovo and yet this week the same people largely who opposed that motion last week are now suggesting that we should double the amount of spending for the operation which last week they said we should not be conducting at all that gives confusion and inconsistency a bad name immy view i did not vote for the administrations original request on ranbouillet i did not feel that we knew enough about what the results of that discussion would be in order to cast a vote at that time and i did not believe in giving any administration a blank check i know that there are a lot of people in this house who do not like president clinton and i think a number of members have gone overboard in trying to politicize this war because they have such intense dislike for the president i have seen quote after quote in the newspapers saying this is clintons war we do not want our fingerprints on it i think those kind of comments are irresponsible this is the wests war this is natos war and in my view the president is doing the best that anybody can under very difficult circumstances that does not mean i agree with everything the administration is doing i agree with senator mccain i believe that this war needs to be prosecuted in the most aggressive way possible and i believe that the best way to assure the success of the air war is to threaten use of a ground war so i do not necessarily agree with the administration on the fine points but he is our commander in chief he is the elected leader of this country we are also elected leaders of this country and we ought to be behaving ourselves in a manner consistent with the honor that has been afforded to each and every one of us by our constituents i do not think we do that when we in one week decide that this house is not going to support that operation and again then in the next week decide but oh by the way we are going to use this war as an excuse to move billions of dollars from next years appropriation into this years appropriation put an emergency label on it which will enable the congress next year to spend 3 billion more on military pork that has nothing whatsoever to do with kosovo in my view that is what is happening today so i want to explain the amendment that i will be offering later in debate the administration has asked about 6 billion to cover the cost of this war plus they have asked for humanitarian assistance the amount that they have requested will pay for an 800plane war 24 hours a day bombing of virtually every target in yugoslavia that one could imagine anywhere that will be sustained on a daily basis through the end of the fiscal year in addition the administration has asked for enough money to fund not just the 24 apaches which are on the ground now but a contingent of 50 apaches over 700 million just to finance that the administration has taken the full estimate of what it will cost to run that war for the remainder of the fiscal year and then on top of that just to be safe they have tossed in an extra 850 million in a contingency fund that is such a large operation that we will run out of targets before we run out of ammunition we will in the words of winston churchill be bouncing the rubble if this continues that long now the committee has done some other things the committee has decided that they would raise the spending for that bill by 125 percent they have asked for 460 million more in munitions my amendment says all right we are not going to argue about that we will accept it they have asked for 400 million for procurement and again we say okay we are not going to argue about it we will accept it they have asked for a billion dollars more than the president in order to avoid having to reprogram from lowpriority items to highpriority items we say okay i doubt that that is fully necessary but we will accept that too what we do not accept are two other items in the bill the budget rules under which we are supposed to operate say that if we want to designate something as an emergency so that it is exempted from the spending caps in our budget it must meet two tests it must first of all be an unanticipated expense and secondly it has to be an expense which will be incurred immediately for an immediate purpose there is 3 billion in the committee bill that does not meet those tests example they have 2 billion in this bill for operation and maintenance which is nothing but moving forward from next years budget 2 billion into this emergency supplemental there is also 1 billion added for 77 military construction projects in europe thirtyseven of those items are not even on the pentagons 5year plan we do not have physical plans for them we do not really know what they are but the money is thrown at them why the reason is very simple there is an agenda on the part of some members of this house which says let us throw in as much as we can call it an emergency kosovo supplemental even though it is not at all related to kosovo and that will enable us to spend 3 billion that we would not have otherwise been able to spend on the regular bill for pork that is what is going on in my view so my amendment does not accept that 3 billion the only military construction items that we fund are those directly related to kosovo three key items that are fully justified including one operation at aviano and the rest we simply say deal with next year in the regular course of business because they do not relate to kosovo in addition we do two other things the committee has 1 8 billion in the bill which they suggest should go for a pay raise and a retirement enrichment package for the troops i support that the problem with the committee amendment is that it is subject to authorization and that means that even though the money is in the bill it cannot actually be delivered to the troops until further legislation is passed so we remove that impediment we remove the language that makes that subject to authorization so that this is not just a potentially empty promise we actually deliver the money that we say we want to provide so in other words we make that pay raise real the second thing we do is to take the supplemental which the house passed previously which is languishing in the senate which the president asked for it to deal with the largest natural disaster in this hemisphere in this century hurricane mitch and to deal with the emergency facing many farmers because of weather and because of the collapse of prices and we include that in this package as well so that we take care of the home front as well as kosovo if we do not deal with that we face the prospect of 100 000 refugees trying to make their way from central american countries through texas through new mexico and it would cost us far more than dealing with it in this bill so what i will simply say is this amendment is an honest effort to reach a compromise position between the administrations original request and the committees overblown efforts to throw in everything but the kitchen sink in this bill so that they can make more room for military pork in the regular military bill i would urge that my colleagues do the responsible thing adopt the obey amendment when it is offered that will send a signal that we are indeed going to play this straight we are not going to abuse the emergency power that we have in the budget act but we will make every dime that is necessary to the kosovo operation available and then some we are exceeding what the

you could find george brown unlike any other person in this house if you wanted to find him at his office you could when you walked in the door he was not returning other peoples phone calls do members know what he was doing he was reading the journals the technical journals the scientific journals that had been published that masterful intellect applied to the good of our nation in 1961 president john kennedy challenged america to put a human being on the moon before the end of 1969 that was a huge challenge we take for granted what happened and thousands of individuals throughout our country listened to this call and took him up on his seriousness and what that meant not only for our nation but what it meant for us as a nation as a global leader many worked in their own significant way to accomplish that feat one of them was george brown how indebted we are to him as a nation for his leadership and his courage many of us as i said take these decisions for granted and these accomplishments for granted once they take place but it always takes individuals of courage and vision to make them happen i think george brown always made sure that we were looking toward the stars i think that just as we had americans that walked on the moon that were launched that he today is walking among the stars and in heaven he certainly has earned it we are indeed a grateful body and we are grateful to his constituents for sending him to us he was a gentle man he was a refined legislator he was a proud californian he was a compassionate human being and i thought that when god called him that he could really answer and say you didnt call me to be successful you called me to be faithful and that he was to what he believed in and what was best in humanity he never left anyone behind i think for that reason marta he walks now not only among the stars but among the saints thank you for sharing george brown with us god bless you george i will always picture you standing there at that bench and i do not think that there is anyone that could ever come into the congress to take your place you will always always be a member here and part of our delegation"],

resolution by april 15 we are going to do that that is the good news the bad news is h that it is a joke s if we look at this and listen to what the gentleman from south carolina o said the gentleman is 3 one of the most thoughtful one of the most intelligent people he actually was a banker once he knows about t money he gave a very erudite explanation of this budget if we listen to the gentleman the most important thing he said was that this resolution puts us on record for the train wreck in september we are right on track we are going to do it all over again this year what we did last year we could talk about medicare medicaid and all those issues social security and education all the issues that are not dealt with here but this budget resolution contains 100 billion more in cuts we did not do that last year we added and we are heading right down the same track i know peoples eyes kind of glaze over when we talk about the budget resolution what is this this is an outline for what is going to happen in this country in this congress one of the issues on 1 9 trillion that is a figure that is sort of out of the reach of most of us but let us just take one issue that is the issue of pharmaceutical prescription drugs how people how seniors are going to get that paid for everybody says it is a good idea but when we look at this budget resolution i have brought this chart here because it really points out what is all about this budget resolution the democratic proposal was for 40 billion locked in for the drug benefit the republican budget says if the committee on ways and means gets around to it we could spend up to 40 billion which would we rather have have it locked in or if they happen to get around to it does it require action this year the democrats say yes the republicans say no there is no requirement in this budget the gentleman from south carolina"], [0.9947549421340227, 0.005245057865977287, 1, "first of all let me again thank the gentleman from florida for his leadership on the substitute and let me also thank the gentlewoman from ohio and the gentlewoman from ohio for this legislation that i had the pleasure of cosponsoring the focus of the amendment that i am offering is to emphasize the heinousness and the tragedy of child sexual abuse so my amendment offers to clarify that child abuse includes child sexual abuse and this will add to the information that the child abuse workers will be able to secure and to be able to investigate in order to determine whether there has been child sexual abuse let me emphasize why this is an important distinction because most often when we think of child abuse we think of the physical abuse that may be noticeable the knocked head the bruised arm the broken arm the brokenleg the burn on the body physical things that can be seen by a school counselor a teacher a friend or a pastor but sometimes children suffer in the quietness and the horror of sexual abuse that cannot be detected by looking at a child fully clothed and the idea is to ensure that in this new legislation we have a circumstance where this is on the minds of those child abuse investigators should they not also inquire look examine and determine whether the child has been sexually abused let me cite the numbers of sexually abused children the numbers are going up in 1990 there were 127 000 children abused sexually in 1991 it goes up 129 425 when we go to 1992 sexual abuse goes 130 000 14 percent 1993 139 000 each year the number of children sexually abused increases when we look at close to 3 million children who are reported abused we find that 12 percent of them suffered sexual abuse might i offer to those who are able to i guess tolerate hearing about the horrificness the heinousness about what happens when a child is sexually abused by citing the report on the autopsy of jonbenet ramsey a case that still stands as one of the singular cases of terrible child abuse and of course an unsolved murder of a child what the autopsy says is that this particular child was found to have been whacked her head was whacked against something and then she was still alive and strangled the autopsy goes on to note there are two injuries in that autopsy that could have killed her one is a strangulation the other is the assorted brain injuries it is not clear in what sequence meyer found an abrasion on the girls hymen which other experts said could indicate a sexual assault the size of the girls hymen which meyer measured at 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter should have more significance the thing that concerns me is that the hymenal opening is measured at 1 centimeter which is too large said kirschner a child abuse specialist but if in fact that was the real measurement that is twice the diameter that it should be usually a hymen in a young child like this should be 4 millimeters and so there was discussion horrible discussion about whether or not jonbenet ramsey was sexually abused there is blood and contusions in the vagina and the hymen has been torn yes descriptive horrific but every day our children face this kind of assault so i think it is extremely important that this language emphasizes the protection of our children as the legislation already does but it emphasizes a real focus on sexually abused children along with other abuse it does not in any way diminish the importance of other abuse but realizes that children can suffer in silence with child abuse and it cannot easily be detected i would hope that my colleagues would support this amendment because it again states to our child abuse investigators be thorough in your work do not be limited in your work and realize that our children suffer in silence when they are sexually abused and you need to inquire and draw from them the information that will protect and save the lives of american children i have an amendment that i would like to offer to this bill in its present form this bill has a tremendous impact on the current abuse and neglect system by enhancing the services available this amendment i am offering would give child protective and child welfare workers additional access to criminal records that would include convictions for sexual abuse according to the statistics on abuse 12 percent of the abuse is sexual abuse any discussion of child abuse is incomplete without including the growing problem of child sexual abuse and exploitation child sexual abuse is any sex act performed by an adult or an older child this includes actual physical abuse such as touching a childs genital area or molestation and it also includes sexual assault selfexposure flashing voyeurism and exposing children to pornography sexual abuse is often committed by a family member incest is the most common form of child sexual abuse however anyone can commit sexual abuse against a child it is often perpetrated by adults that have been entrusted with caring for a childa family friend babysitter a teacher day care worker or even religious leaders even a child can commit sexual abuse against another child the purpose of my amendment is to specify the importance of sexual abuse as a crime that should be recognized by child welfare and child protection workers when investigating incidences of child abuse it gives protection and child welfare workers access to the conviction records and orders of protection based on sexual abuse in addition to domestic and child abuse a history of sexual abuse whether it is against a child or an adult is significant information sexual abuse against children is a harsh reality that is very common at least one out of five adult women and one out of ten adult men report having been sexually abused as children these cases may represent the untold stories of many children now adults who suffered in silence due to sexual abuse now we have mechanisms in place to investigate inciclences of child abuse however in some cases certain information about an alleged abusers past may not be available this bill remedies that situation by making criminal records for sexual abuse available in texas there were more than 111 000 investigations of child abuse and neglect by the child protective services in texas of those cases 7 650 were sexual abuse in one infamous case the death of jonbenet ramsey sexual assault may have been a factor in her death the autopsy was released this summer and was inconclusive as to whether the child had been sexually assaulted however it was clear to the investigators that in a case such as this an inquiry had to be made concerning possible sexual assault this change only adds the term sexual abuse to the bill in an attempt to give child protection and child welfare workers another factor to consider when assessing the risk related to the protection of children i ask my colleagues to support this technical amendment to this bill it is uncontroversial and it would further enhance the ability of the abuse and neglect system to combat child abuse thank you"], [0.9947124272584915, 0.005287572741508484, 1, "i have no further requests for time i yield back the balance of my time

gentleman from virginia for this resolution i want to thank the gentleman from ohio and i want to associate myself with his words that were just spoken james madison a young aristocrat who began his public career in public service at age 23 would become indelibly linked to three great works of american democracy the constitution the federalist papers and the bill of rights in 1776 madison was a member of the virginia constitutional committee a body that drafted virginias first constitution and a bill of rights which later would become a model for the bill of rights appended to the united states constitution when madison was elected to the united states house of representatives he became the primary author of the first 12 proposed amendments to the constitution ten of these the bill of rights were adopted at the constitutional convention which opened on may 25 1787 madison set the tone by introducing a document he authored called the virginia plan the plan called for a strong central government consisting of a supreme legislature executive and judiciary it provided for a national legislature consisting of two houses one elected by the people and the other appointed by the first from a body of nominees submitted by statelegislatures representation in these bodies would be based on the population of the states it provided for an executive to be elected by this national legislature the plan also defined a national judiciary and a council of revision charged with reviewing the constitutionality of legislation as the driving force in the formation of the constitution james madison organized the convention set the agenda and worked through many obstacles that threatened the process the notes he took throughout the convention constitute this countrys best and most complete record of the 1787 constitutional convention madisons notes which comprise a third of the federalist papers were published in the 1830s as we honor james madison today we remember his role in the great debate on slavery he openly acknowledged that slavery was a great evil was a member of an antislavery society and even authored a plan for the emancipation of slaves nevertheless history documents that he continued to regard and hold slaves as property until his death in fact he himself said that slaves remain such in spite of the declarations that all men are born equally free as i reflect on this serious dichotomy i am mindful of a quote from madisons 1810 state of the union address that is applicable to our moderi society he stated that american citizens are instrumental in carrying on a traffic in enslaved africans equally in violation of the laws of humanity and in defiance of those of their own country the same just and benevolent motives which produced interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be felt by congress in devising further means of suppressing the evil it is my hope that 190 years later this congress heeds these words and makes a strong commitment to suppressing the evil of racism and prejudice against minorities that exists today as this congress labors through this week to complete its work on the many pending appropriations bills i urge my colleagues to keep one of madisons messages on public leadership in mind he said the aim of every political constitution is or ought to be first to obtain for rulers men and women who possess most wisdom to discern and most virtue to pursue the common good of the society i believe that all of us who are elected to serve in the congress come to serve the common good

the president said in his state of the union message was it those issues that finally lead to well as soon as the vice president said it the next thing we know we have this bill here it is the history
