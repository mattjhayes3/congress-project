"that they had worked hard for this day we know from the nonpartisan director of the congressional budget office that apparently what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public wants to do what the gentleman from massachusetts said where we find problems and where we need to make adjustments we should do it

thank you to my colleague from north carolina you are very gracious in yielding to me and it has been a pleasure to work with you i thank those assembled here tonight i just want to talk a little bit about some of the issues we have going on in the west in northern california first of all the excitement we have of coming init is a new congress it is a new direction for our country i think we have a stronger majority in the house of representatives of the republican house as well it is a different majority over in the senate a lot of people arent too concerned with what party it is or what partisan issues are they want to see results that is what i am looking for as well many bills were sent out of the house last session and languished on a desk over on the senate side and i think we will now see action on those commonsense measures that are going to help jobs in america help our economy rebound and help people get out from under the grip of government power and government regulation that is just killing their hopes and killing their ideals we are looking for that in this new session and we expect we will be held accountable to make that happen it is not going to be a miracle we are not going to get all the results we hoped for but at least there are going to be things on the record now that have gone through this house and have gone to the senate that will be showing the american people what our agenda is and what it has been about bringing it back home to california i represent the first district in the northeast portion of the state it is a beautiful district i am very proud to have been elected for a second time to represent the first district it is an area that has a lot of great resources that benefit our whole state even our whole country to be able to have my family here with me in washington attending the festivities the honor of being sworn in and getting started getting a fast start going to work here in this new 114th has just been a real delight what we need to be happening in california is a better and wiser use of our resources you may have seen at the end of the last session we were working towards better management of our water supply now we have a deluge of rain once in a while even when we are suffering drought for the last few years in california the water seems to all come at once if it isnt being saved in snowpack it will come quickly via rain through our streams and that is an opportunity for us that we should be retaining that behind the dam so that we have as well the water that gets down the feather river and the sacramento river and can be transferred and put somewhere to be used later we have the ability to have the water allocated as needed for fish for habitat but there is excess water that needs to be stored i dont know why that isnt the automatic protocol but congressa bill i cosponsored with many of my other colleagues put forward reminding the bureau of reclamation and others that they need to retain this extra water it isnt needed for fish and it isnt needed for the normal runs so we will have more stored later that is what we will continue to work for but i still go back to the vision that people before us had that have given us shasta dam lake oroville and the whole state water project and the central valley project that we have in our state that we have benefited from for so many years that everybody benefits from whether you are an environmentalist a farmer a person who lives in a city or if you just have a tap in the country if you are not on a well you are probably benefiting from these projects because we had the vision in the past to build them and we didnt have nearly the roadblocks now of course we have great environmental concerns and environmental awareness to do things better than we did in the 1850s or the 1880s or what have you we know how to do these things but it doesnt mean that because of a handful of people who dont want to see things happen we stop the progress for all the rest of us so that is what we will be pushing for in this new congress to build more water storage we can do that in northern california sites reservoir and there are other projects that can be enhanced to retain more water and there are smarter ways to keep the water that we do have to make the water go further because it is necessary the way california is suffering from droughts agricultural land is going to be the first thing to go any time an emergency can be declared to switch whatever water does get to agriculture to meet other needs around the state we have to take care of people first and we have to take care of cities but when we see so much being run out through the golden gate that could be saved or for questionable tactics on fish that really havent been proven for that kind of habitat then we are missing the mark so we will be working very hard to add to our water storage and to be smarter with the water we have available to us because we cant count on a record rainfall this year we are very thankful and we have been blessed with good rainfall in november and the early part of december but it has tailed off lately we will need record rainfall the rest of the season up through the spring to have the kind of water we need to get through a good crop year in the meantime we should be doing everything possible in government to enhance to retain to be smarter with the water we have when we hear ideas of removing dams in the north part of the state part of my district that produce hydroelectric power because of dubious studies that might benefit fish we are hurting our region of the state we are hurting our grid by taking enough renewable electricity off the grid that would somehow need to be replaced with other green power to manage 70 000 homes in the state because of dubious lack of science we need to battle through this and have smarter use of our resources another thing that we are very rich in in our part of the state is timber each summer we see the crisis of nonmanagement of our timber and what that looks like it is in the air it is in our brown skies we get to breathe that the people within those communities are wondering why their mills are shut down and why their storefronts are boarded up and why they dont have jobs and why they have things like domestic violence increasing because people dont have work in those communities sometimes because their industry has been taken away from them i sit on the natural resources committee to get after both of these and other issuesour water our timber use and other resourcesthat are so necessary to the rural part of the state the rural west that has been languishing for many years ever since the endangered species act was passed in 1973 for good reason at the time to save the bald eagle we have bald eagles in our rice fields where i live at home but we have gone so far beyond that rural america is suffering from this type of regulation that it isnt even proven to help recover a single species indeed somewhere around 1 percent at best of species have been recovered after 40plus years of the endangered species act that is pretty deplorable for what the cost has been to the people to the jobs and for the communities and their values but i am still optimistic that america is turning the corner and seeing things a little bit differently and that the job needs to come back home and the jobs at home need to be revived once again as a grower of grain myself we look at our alternatives do we want to be in a situation where in the past we were dependent on oil from people who dont like us much do we want to be in a position to have our grain crops the breadbasket of our nation do we want to become more dependent on that from people who maybe arent always a reliable ally overseas wheat from russia and rice from china do we want to rely on that or do we want to do the best we can my fellow farmers across the country and in my area they are good stewards of the land many have been there for many many generations some of the ranchers i know their families have been farming and ranching for 160 years in northern california my own family 80plus years we know how to take care of the land we know what needs to be done it is sustainable to use that buzz word that goes around a lot these days if it wasnt sustainable the land wouldnt still produce so this is the type of thing we are fighting for if we dont have a breadbasket in this country what will america rely on to keep us fed with the unrest we have in the world ultimately if we cant fuel our own armies if it becomes necessary what kind of position will we be in to defend ourselves or our allies like in europe like in israel like in japan or others we have great relations and great trade with we are in great peril right now if we keep our head in the sand on these issues we need to look at the resources we have as i look at the young people in the audience tonight one of the first things that i am reminded of is that we are running an 18 trillion national debt we have lived for the future in the present on someone elses money and so every dollar we have every dollar that comes in we have to be good stewards of much better than in the past so every dollar has to go for the type of infrastructure that will improve our transportation system our water system our flood control system and keep our communities safe and not on frivolous things i am reminded in california instead of this water infrastructure that we so desperately need we have had several years of drought to remind us they are still pursuing a highspeed rail system in california as a former state legislator we were right in the middle of that as it was coming to a head what will the rail cost voters were told then 33 billion to go from san francisco to los angeles at 220 miles per hour it isnt even close to being that project anymore and the price has tripled at least it has gone from 33 billion to at least 98 billion by the admission of the rail authority in a hearing we had in the state legislature back then they are still chasing this dream now they have tried to downsize it to be a 68 billion project to this day right now they have still only identified 13 billion 10 billion from the state bond and 3 billion from the federal government via the stimulus act of 2009 so 13 billion of a needed and downsized 68 billion project they are 55 billion short and they still think today they are going to go find that money from the private sector they are staying away in droves there is no way that it is going to be built anywhere near on time anywhere near on any kind of budget or that the riders they would have will ever be able to afford to ride it why dont we take a fraction of that money of the 13 billion or the 68 billion or whatever number it is and put it towards the water storage we need we could build two really nice dams with 68 billion especially with private sector money that wants to come in and be a partner on this lets get it done because this is the infrastructure that will help our state and help the people and help bring jobs back to rural california and rural america i am looking for help from my other colleagues from other states especially other western states that have water infrastructure needs they are looking at themselves lets work together on this that is what made us great back in the day we have had these huge projects that have made so much hydroelectric power we like green power we like renewable power when it rains behind a dam you have renewable power and it is reliable and it is low cost much more so than windmills and solar panels that require government assistance to put them in and keep them going lets do the right thing here and allow these things to happen all that private sector to happen i am optimistic in this congress that we can make that case and put it in front of the american people i ask the president to join with us and help on that whether it is that or the further development of energy that we need in this country to stay ahead of the curve we are seeing prices coming down amazingly hydraulic fracturing has played a big part in us seeing the price of fuel in some areasnot in california but other states going below 2 a gallon in california we are still taxing ourselves and thinking up capandtrade measures to drive the cost up so we will be our own island of high costs but the other 49 states god bless you you have it pretty good the vision that we have had to do these things is what we need desperately going forward in 2015 because when we are productive like what we can produce in northern california with agriculture with timber with our mine resources all of the other things that come from the land that sets the table for everything else across our district and across our state and across the whole country that puts us back to work again we have trillions of dollars offshore that would love to be repatriated back to this country if we had any kind of constant as to what the tax burden would be for those dollars for those businesses and investment that needs to be here any kind of consistency for what our regulatory burden would be so they could predict if they are to put 30year loans and 30year infrastructure in place will they be able to do business 5 years from now we would be bringing american jobs back if we could repatriate that money back here so lets get it done we dont come here in congressat least i haventbecause it is nice to wear a suit and tie we come here to get results to be results oriented we need to use real facts real figures real budgets real numbers to get to the core of what we are supposed to be doing as to what the founders had set for our government the government is doing a lot more things it has no business doing and it cant do well lets make sure that we are doing and we have the economy we have the engineering to generate so we have a functioning school system it has the funding it needs at fair and proper levels for our law enforcement so they are not left wanting for the equipment and backup they need and for the folks deployed overseas defending our borders as well as helping our allies we shouldnt leave them wanting while they are deployed and certainly with the mess that the va system is when they come back home the promises made to them are broken and the shame that we should all feel when our veterans so many are left homeless or simply begging to have their claims processed i am confident in this new congress that the house and the senate can work together and put these ideas forward we can put them out in front of the american people have the accountability have the oversight that our job demands we will get there so whether it is now or 2 years from now i challenge the president to look at these things from a commonsense way of thinking think about america first that is what we will be doing in this house and over in the senate so from northern california to the rest of the country help us all to be productive and to live the lives we choose to give our kids a chance to live at home to find jobs and opportunities in their own communitiesfarming ranching mining whatever it is or related industries in those small towns that so many are boarded up now let them have that chance to live at home not have to go someplace else go to a big city somewhere a different state or even overseas to try to find good employment so they would have the dream they see fit and the one that their parents would like to pass along to them my colleague from north carolina i appreciate the time tonight and the opportunity to talk about my district and the things we need to do there as well as what we need to do for our country i bid you a good evening and thank you"], [0.9859070777893066,

that was put into law has been changed 17 times in the last 16 or so years it made cuts to healthcare providers we have caused some healthcare providers to retire early it was 716 billion that obamacare took from medicare in order to supposedly fund 30 million or so that we were told didnt have insurance now we have cost millions their health insurance policy they liked and i say we not a single republican voted for that bill it has cost americans millions of americans the doctor that they wanted to use we have seen promise after promise that was made about obamacare that was broken it absolutely wasnt true then we find out that there were advisers around the white house who were advising all along they are not going to be able to keep their insurance policy they are not going to be able to keep their doctors maybe we want to change the way that kind of thing is said it did major damageand continues to do major damageto health care so on top of that overlay we had these ongoing cuts to the healthcare providers if we didnt step in each year and temporarily pause them it would have put so many healthcare providers out of business and made it extremely difficult for americans to get the health care they need even more than it already is even more than obamacare has jeopardized so something needed to be done my friend dr mike burgess had pushed through a fix a remedy last year of 63 pages it was very well thought out he is a very bright terrific doctor a great congressman and a friend we have spent a lot of time this week talking about the fix to the cuts to reimbursement for physicians and the bill today on the good side provided a permanent fix if this becomes law if the senate passes what we did it stops the slow deletion of some healthcare providers efforts and work this provides a framework from which medicare can be reformed for the future it is valued at 175 billion and the best estimate we have gotten is that 140 billion of the 175 billion is not offset with any cuts anywhere else this would be a straight addition of 140 billion to our childrens and grandchildrens enormous debtwhat some refer to as intergenerational theft it does have henry hyde language protecting against federal funds being used for abortion i have always thought the world of henry hyde and was honored to overlap with him 2 years his work in standing for the unborn children the most innocent among us is just an extraordinary lifes work that he did i dont know that federal funds for abortions for people on medicare is as big an issue as some might think anyway the hyde language is in there it puts it in the tax code that is a big deal some of my democratic friends were not big on that there is also reauthorization for chip there are the secure rural schools our rural schools especially those in national parks have been cheated for many years from the income that they were supposed to have by giving up land they couldnt tax any more by giving up other sources of revenue from the land they agreed to allow land to be used or become national forests and they were to be reimbursed by proceeds from the sale of timber but we have a forest service administrationnot just this one it has been going for a whilewhere production has either slowed dramatically or completely been eliminated even though pine trees where i live are an entirely renewable resource you plant them and you are ready to harvest them in 15 20 years we are not talking sequoias we are just talking a renewable resource it is well managed in east texas and other places around the country but since production has stopped and we are buying so much lumber from other countries now it is not good for america not good for our trade imbalance but it has been a federal government policy and it has put schools in an extremely detrimental position especially in rural areas especially in areas where there have been national forests so it is nice to have another bandaid so to speak to address that issue it should have been in here it should have been done before now but on the other side getting back to 140 billion that is not offset by cuts anywhere else adding it into the intergenerational theftand it also concerns me we had 212 republicans today that voted for this sgr fix it would have been so easy to have enough of an adjustment into this bill that we could add six more republicans and it would have been able to pass without any republican leader begging for support from the democrats without coming to support from conservatives with the vote on dhs funding we saw 167 republicans voted against it because it didnt keep our promise to stop the illegal unconstitutional amnesty that dhs had done as ordered by the president and there were 75 republicans some of whom are very conservative but they did vote with the speaker on that bill and with the majority of democrats to pass that funding but i think that gives us an indication that out of the republican conferencethe massive portion of the republican conference represents very conservative districts and there are republicans that thank god we have that are from more moderate areas but somewhere between onefourth and onethird perhaps it just seems like this bill today was one of those bills where we would be better off if we negotiated a deal among the republicans and go through regular order that is what we promised you put us in the majority we will go through regular order we will have hearings on this entire bill there will be open opportunities to discuss it to amend it to have legislative hearings before you even do the votes on it in committee we didnt do that the bill was filed 2 days ago on the 24th we had a couple of days with this bill that is not adequate for something this important it does add some means testing for seniors it appears very clear it is going to cause healthcare providers to have to add more clerical workerspeople that dont do health care they just do paperwork so there will be more costs so we didnt have a chance to adequately investigate the terminology of this bill and the longterm effects it will have on health care it is kind of important this also came 1 day after we voted for a budget that was important to get to the point where we could have reconciliation that let us deal with important issues like obamacare we passed the budget easily and we had a number of different budgets we could vote for i thought tom price did a good job of marshalling the efforts on that but the point is most of us were so focused on the budget through the vote yesterday that we really had one night to prepare on this sgr with the actual language that was filed on tuesday i was good with the 63 pages dr burgess had used last year but there were over 200 pages i really dont know the longterm effects of what we did and that is why though i have been clamoring for an sgr fix i couldnt vote for it this isnt how we do things we are supposed to first do no harm we dont know what harm we may have done in that bill we know we did some good but we dont know what harm we should have had some more time to analyze this and take the language back to our physicians our healthcare providers and say youre the one doing this youre the one trying to save lives enhance lives what will this do to you what will this language do to you then come back and have the vote so i appreciate the work for those that have been spending so much time on what is often referred to as the doctor fix we definitely needed that as another fix this is more permanent we dont know what the senate will do and that is another one of our problems there is some rather breathtaking news that has come out today about what the obama administration has done in the way of damage to the nation of israelit sounds like this action was extremely pettyin an effort to slap israel without proper regard for the fact that they are the most important ally we have anywhere in the middle east and one of the very most important allies we have in the world it is just breathtaking what was done actually to put this in perspective this article march 23 from joel pollak says obamas chief of staff fires up j street israels occupation must end the article says white house chief of staff denis mcdonough earned raucous cheers from the leftwing activists gathered at j streets fifth annual conference in washington on monday when he attacked israels occupation of the west bank an occupation that has lasted almost 50 years must end j street was founded to disrupt the close unitedstates israel alliance and to serve as an alternative to the american israel public affairs committee the powerful proisrael group well that is interesting if we use mr mcdonoughs rationale about the israel occupation and how it must end then that would mean that at the turn of the 20th century if he had been around clamoring for on behalf of this presidentwere he president around the end of the 1800she would have been saying it is time to end americas occupation of texas had he been around in say 1823 speaking for president obama back then had he been president then if he used this same reasoning he would have been saying it is time for the occupation of our thirteen colonies to stop and we give all the land back to england this is no time for the thirteen colonies to continue to occupy what we are calling the united states it is time to give that back to england it was theirs originally the french had some at one time there were differing claims but basically time to quit occupying the united states and give this all back to england it is time to give the west of the united states you might have heard him say if he had been around in the early 20th century time to give back all the west to whoever had it before whether it was mexico spain whoever may have been claiming it we have been occupying it that is not the way the world works that is not the way the united states worked native american tribes were constantly taking each other on different parts of the country taking over others land that has gone on around the world when you have a group of people living in the nation of israel saying we refuse to ever recognize israels right to exist we want to wipe the jewish people off the map we want to wipe israel off the map then that is not a nation that you sit down with then when you have a nation like iran that is doingthey make clear even as of last week that the top leaders in iran want death to america well apparently when this administration hears a religious fanatic that has killed american soldiers killed american civilians has really been at the lead of killing americans wherever they could find them and have an opportunity to kill them and want to wipe israel off the map as the little satan and wipe america off the map as the great satanthey have continued to pursue nuclear weapons and while this administration was rushing and continue to rush to talk to the leaders in iran it leaves some of us aghast at how blind the administration can be as to who is our friend and who is our enemy it was denis mcdonough this article talks about speaking to the group according to this article that was founded to disrupt the close relationship between unitedstates and israel and he fired them up saying the occupation that lasted almost 50 years must end it reminded me oh yeah i remember another speech he gave and this transcript is from the white house web site this was march 6 of 2011 and denis mcdonough the same guy that thinks we need to run israel out of the land of israel he said thisand i am quoting from the speech from the white house web site thank you imam magid for your very kind introduction and welcome i know that president obama was very grateful that you led the prayer at last summers iftar dinner at the white house which as the president noted is a tradition stretching back more than two centuries to when thomas jefferson hosted the first iftar at the white house thank you also for being one of our i might parenthetically interject here into mr mcdonoughs speech glowing praise for imam magid that actually this is imam magid who was president of the islamic society of north america the islamic society of north america a little background on them they were named as a coconspirator to fund terrorism in the largest prosecution in the united states history for funding of terrorismthis was in a united states district court in dallasin short referred to as the holy land foundation trial they were the main defendant their principals the list of unindicted coconspirators from that trial included the council on american islamic relations cair the islamic society of north america isna and the north american islamic trust nait these coconspirators were not tried in the first round of prosecutions in dallas under the bush administration but in november of 2008 all five defendants were convicted on a massive number of charges of supporting terrorism the evidence utilized in the first round of the prosecutions some that participated anticipate would be used in another trial against other named coconspirators if they were successful in getting the first convictions which they did however before the convictions were finalized there was an election president obama was elected president and we got a new attorney general and they decided despite what the evidence showed despite what the courts had found they are not going to prosecute the islamic society of north america and caircair has a very lovely building just down the street from us here i can see cair from my window in the case in dallas cair nait isna they filed pleadings demanding that the judge remove their names as coconspirators in supporting terrorism the judge reviewed all the evidence had the hearing and he ruled that their names would not be struck as coconspirators because there was plenty of evidence to support them as coconspirators supporting terrorism they appealed that to the fifth circuit court of appeals for the united states and the fifth circuit in their order confirmed that there was a prima facie case made that the entities cair nait isna those associations have strong associations with the muslim brotherhood namely hamas its palestinian branch which was specifically designated as a terrorist organization by the unitedstates government anyway the organization here that the federal courts found had plenty of evidence to make a case against them as supporters of terrorism have become partners with this administration and that is why denis mcdonough who was getting the acclaim for demanding israel leave part of israeli territory he was there back in 2011 giving praise to imam magid thanking him for his wonderful prayers at the white house this is a guy that is president of what two federal courts have said had plenty of evidence to show they are coconspirators in supporting terrorism this business about oh the long tradition going back to thomas jefferson of iftar at the white house iftar is the celebration during the month of augustor after the fasting during the month of august for the religious observance of muslims and iftar is the feast after the fasting if you go back to what they say was the first iftar under thomas jefferson it doesnt appear to me that jefferson realized he was having an iftar dinner he wanted to have a dinner with a muslim leader and he couldnt do it until the fasting was over and so when he could eat they had a meal it is kind of like hearing people say well thomas jefferson having a copy of the koran shows how openminded it was no it shows the fact that he had been a diplomat negotiating with radical islamists called barbary pirates as to why they kept capturing united states navynot navybut seamen and holding them for ransom they had so many of our sailors that they held in captivity we were paying a massive part of our budget for ransom to get these back jefferson was one of those that went over and negotiated and apparently asked why do you keep attacking us we dont even have a navy why you are attacking us we are not a threat to you he was reportedly told in our religion we believe that if we die while attacking you an infidel we go to paradise jefferson was so well read he couldnt believe there was a religion that thought you could go to paradise if you die killing innocent people so he got his own english translation of the koran his ultimate action was to create and send a new thing called united states marines to the shores of tripoli because he realized there is not going to be any negotiation that is adequate to deal with these radical islamists there is only one way to beat them and that is to physically beat them in a fight to the finish it kept them off our backs for some time well that is denis mcdonough speaking for the president in 2011 and now then we know that the white house is doing everything it can to bend over backwards the state department oh iran what can we do for you okay now we find out today they are going to let them have centrifuges spinning in their secret facility they didnt even disclose until we found out about it and they are going to let them keep having centrifuges spin there look they will almost do anything to get them to sign some kind of agreement bending over backwards but they cant spare a minute to meet with the leader of israel cant spare the president vice president or one of the cabinet to come listen to netanyahuoh no then today this outrage has come to light that the united states the obama administration has declassified a document that reveals israels nuclear program to the world especially to iran and to those who want to destroy israel so they will know exactly what they are after what they are up against what has happened what has come to light today of this administration declassifying a document obviously it is a slap at netanyahu it is a slap at the israeli people for coming out in droves to support a group of representatives that this president doesnt approve of we are betraying this great ally of ours israel if you believe the bible judgment will be coming down on our country for what our elected officials and appointed officials have done in betraying israel there will be problems for this if you dont believe the bible then just use common sense when you betray your most trusted ally in this tornapart middle east then you are going to have problems galore i have talked with leaders in those countries i cant now because the speaker wont let me go talk to them overseas anymore that is what you call retribution if you dont support the speaker i get that i am fine with that as a result of him canceling my trip this weekend i get to be on fox news anyway thank you somebody needs to be friendly to our allies and stand up against our enemies and this administration is not doing it this betrayal is going to do more damage in the world than the snotty little act that was intended to slap at netanyahu and the israeli voters than we could possibly imagine this is just unbelievable now if you believe that there are lessons worth noting in the bible you could go back to king hezekiah who entertained the babylonian leaders if you believe the account in the bible god sent isaiah to hezekiah and asked him what have you done he already knew but hezekiah said in effectand this is texas paraphrasewell we met with these lovely wonderful leaders from babylon and we showed them all of our treasure in the most correct translation he adds and we showed them all of the defenses we have in our arsenal isaiah basically says because you have done that you fool you will lose the country this is the kind of thing that brings down nations it was petty and it was a betrayal and people need to be called to account for it i yield back the balance of

to applaud themselves for fixing the highway trust fund like the proverbial magician that takes the shiny object in one hand to distract you they will with sleight of hand with the other hand borrow 8 1 billion when the american people arent watching i want to refer you to the chart on my left you will see three lines i want to talk about the bottom two first the very bottom line is the revenue line that is the amount of money we receive from excise taxes and gasoline taxes to pay for roads and bridges and infrastructure the red line above it is the expenditures that is the money that we are spending the difference between the two is the deficit that is the borrowed money i will show you where it is for decadesfor decadeswe have been adding red ink to the american peoples debt we have been borrowing billions of dollars annually each year to spend on our infrastructure rather than telling the american people the truth that if we believe as members of congress and this body that roads and bridges and airports are important enough to buy they are important enough to pay for but we dont want to do that we dont want to tell the american people we are going to raise taxes but i want you to know that this afternoon when we borrow 1 8 billion to build roads and bridges we are going to raise taxes here is what i mean we are going to raise taxes on kids on our children on my 11yearold grandson do you want to know why because we dont want to tell them we dont want to tell adults today that they have to pay for the roads and bridges that they buy today what we would rather do is say you can have these things for free we are going to wave the shiny magic object here we are going to borrow money while telling the american people it is paid for and then we are going to ask our children when they grow up to buy our roads and bridges when the bill comes due we are perfectly fine on raising taxes on kids raising taxes on children do you want to know why because they cant vote so lets tell them they have got to pay for this stuff rather than us paying for this stuff remember all deficit spending is nothing more than future taxation what is the top line here the hash line back in 1992 the last time that we raised the national gas tax congress before i came here and before many of my colleagues came here decided not to index the gas tax to inflation so our purchasing power is disappearing because we have left it where it is now i am going to use a green pen here all that green is lost opportunity i dont know how many of you have flown into laguardia jfk ohare these international airports they are the international gateway to the united states economy and they are also an international embarrassment on a global scale we continue to let these places degrade and fall apart and yet none of us in our own spending would do that in our homes if the roof leaks we fix it if the house needs painting we paint it we take care of these things and maintain them because they are our assets they are what we are passing on to the next generation we have lost all this opportunity what i would much rather see is either we are honest with the american people and say if it is worth buying and worth doing we should pay for it and then raise the taxes necessary to do that like ronald reagan did like george bush did like dwight eisenhower didall republican presidents they said it is worth paying for lets not burden our children lets not tax them if it is worth doing that we should do that if it is not worth doing that we should bring our expenditures down to the revenue level and not spend the money in the first place so that we are sending a clear message back to each of the states that are getting federal largess on highways and roads that we are not going to do that and that you need to raise your taxes to cover the gap both of those ideas would be better than what we are doing right now which is nothing but a magic trick on children and

imagine this this provision is expired and my colleagues in the minority are concerned about adding to the deficit because this provision that expired on december 31 we are trying to renew without raising taxes on other people when spending expires the chairman mentioned a few of those programs and we renew them at the same level it doesnt add to the deficit think about that go talk to some
