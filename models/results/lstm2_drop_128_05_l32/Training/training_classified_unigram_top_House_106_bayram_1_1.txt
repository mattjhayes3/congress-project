9 5 million to reduce the repair backlog at veterans national cemeteries i know the chairman will say that the department is authorized to do that that we have plussed up the money that we have put in the biggest money in the history of our congress the fact remains that while that could be said about any one item that i bring up today the sum total of all the items that are in this budget that was prepared by our veterans organization the independent budget we simply cannot fund all of those with the present funding we need another 1 5 billion or so to do that while any individual item i may bring up can be handled within the appropriation all of the needs our veterans have cannot be over the years the national cemetery system has struggled to maintain the appearance of our 115 national cemeteries but budget shortfalls in the past have forced the system to address only the highest priority projects as a result preventative maintenance and infrastructure repairs have been neglected broken sprinkler systems for example which result in parched and dead grass and sunken graves which have not been reinforced contribute to an appearance of neglect in many cemeteries this is not a way to treat the memory of our veterans some cemeteries have not had the funds to repair badly cracked walkways and they are actually hazardous to the many older people visiting the grave of a loved one backhoes and other important equipment stand idle because funding is not available for repairs families must postpone funerals they must postpone funerals because the equipment required cannot even be

opposition to this legislation i appreciate the speech just given by the gentlewoman except this is a little different than the problem she outlined this is about preventing the injuries to those workers this is about the fact that if we do this right those workers will not have to go on workers comp their employers will not have to pay their health costs they will not have to pay their compensation costs and people can stay on the job and they can feed their families and provide the wherewithal for their children that is what this legislation is about to suggest somehow that what we need is one more study we need good science the opposition to this legislation is not about good science it is not about one more study it is about a flat out opposition to the imposition of these rules and regulations to try to protect workers from musculoskeletal syndrome and the purpose of that is this that we can keep people on the job where they can remain productive now to listen to the republican argument here simply we must suspend reality we must suspend the reality of what every member of congress experiences when they fly back to their districts and that is the number of flight attendants and others who are working on the airplane delivering meals taking care of us while we are there who are wearing wrist braces elbow braces tendon braces all the rest of it because of repetitive motion the redesign of the carts on the airplanes because of repetitive motion the baggage handlers and others because of repetitive motion who are wearing belts and back supports and all those kinds of activities because of repetitive motion because they understand that if they do not do that they are going to end up disabled they are going to end up with health care dosts and they are going to end up out of work and their employer understands that suspend reality when going into the home depot suspend reality when going into the price club or into costco where we see people engaged in repetitive motion who are wearing the kinds of preventive apparatus on their backs on their arms and the rest of it so that they will not lose theworking hours they will not lose that kind of income again their employers understand that their insurers understand that and they require that to be part of the workplace that is what this legislation is really about it is about the recognition of the reality of the workplace and what we can now do what we have the ability to do and what we know from a medical scientific standpoint will help prevent these kinds of injuries injuries that plague hundreds of thousands of workers a year who are disabled and lose income employers who lose the productivity of those workers who have to train and retrain new people who have to go out and find replacements for those individuals that is what this legislation is about it is not about one more study we have peer reviewed the evidence here until we are blue in the face we have provided the studies and it has been going on and on and on as somebody mentioned earlier it was originally elizabeth dole who said the time has come now to deal with this problem because of the injuries that were occurring in the workplace we see this being responded to where we redesign keyboards or structuring for the keyboard that will not induce the kind of pain for people who have to work at it all the time at the checkout counters in the supermarket we are redesigning the checkout counter so that people the clerks there will not suffer these kinds of injuries to their arms and to their elbows as they do their job so that is the kind of recognition that we are looking for that is the kind of remedial activities that can be dealt with that can reduce the cost to the employer can reduce the cost in the workplace and reduce health care costs that is why it is so urgent that we not pass this legislation which is an attempt to obstruct the imposition of this rule because this is a rule that workers deserve this is a rule that workers need that their families need if they are going to be able to continue to be gainfully employed the evidence is clear the science is clear the health is clear on this measure and the time has come the time has come to implement this rule we have had statements before from the committee on appropriations as i was saying that the effort was not to delay this we now see that this is an effort to delay this because the republicans believe somehow that if they win the election they can cut a better deal 18 months from now well the better

rather poorly drafted amendment that is very different than the one its proponents defend in the first place it does not just say law it says law rule or regulation if there were to be a policy in the prosecutors office governing plea bargaining in controlled substances cases and my colleague wanted to amend that rule by which he controlled the practice of plea bargaining it might be effective but

established to guarantee that any sale or diversion be fully negotiated and approved by representatives of the united states government and the government of canada in consultation with effective states and provinces i want to remind our colleagues of that house action because there is another threat to the great lakes one posed by drilling for gas and oil in and under the waters of this great natural resource we are not being alarmists water diversion and drilling for gas and oil are real threats to one of the worlds most valuable resources consider these facts as i list each item i want you to think about each of these facts in terms of potential impact on our great lakes seventy percent of the earths surface is covered by water 97 5 percent of that water is sea water only 2 5 percent of the surface water is fresh water the great lakes contains 6 quadrillion gallons of fresh water onefifth of the earths fresh water resources the great lakes are home to 40 million people onequarter of canadas population lives in the great lakes basin the world bank predicts that by about the year 2025 more than 3 billion people in 52countries will suffer water shortages for drinking or sanitation more than 300 cities in china are currently experiencing water shortages and more than 100 are deemed to be in condition of acute water scarcity the global demand for water is doubling every 21 years citizens of the united states and canada use and consume more than 100 gallons per day per person eighty percent of the fresh water used goes to agricultural production i thank the buffalo news for many of those facts i present them as random facts because like pieces of a puzzle they must be analyzed and arranged to see their importance the world bank has studied this puzzle and i call your attention to a quote from a world bank report which appeared in the buffalo news in a march 1999 story the world bank report predicted wars of the next century will be fought over fresh water so are we really being alarmists i believe not a company in sault ste marie ontario just one company was given a permit last year to take up the 2 6 million gallons of water per day for 5 years from lake superior i was joined by members of the ontario parliament and the canadian new democratic party in bringing public attention to this permit which was revoked by the ontario government but all fresh water will increasingly be eyed as a potential commodity a vancouverbased company global water corporation has an agreement with an alaskan community of sitka to take fresh water from a lake and ship it by tanker to china the deal allows global to take up to 5 billion gallons a year for 30 years global envisions 445 tankers per year carrying fresh water to asia now we have spoken of

at this time that although i have mentioned china twice in my remarks i am not attempting to invoke it as threat to our own security china is merely a customer in need of fresh water now the entire world will be eying our natural resource as of today the issue of sale and diversion of great lakes water and fresh water throughout this country remains unsolved following the house vote on my resolution the unitedstates and canada have asked the international joint commission to study the issue on water diversion along the entire border from alaska to the st lawrence river to maine their preliminary report on diversion should be ready in august a final report on our joint water resources should be completed early next year until all questions on the sale or diversion of fresh water are answered i have introduced legislation which would place a moratorium on any sale or diversion of fresh water in this country until we have these questions answered in the meantime there is another threat to the great lakes as it is the policy of my home state of michigan to allow drilling for gas and oil underneath the great lakes canada allows gas rigs drilling directly into lake

16 1989 at the university of central america in el salvador six jesuit priests their housekeeper and their 15 yearold daughter were pulled from their beds forced to lie on the ground and executed in cold blood at that time el salvador was in the midst of a horrible civil war the united states had sided with the salvadoran government and we had sent the salvadoran military a total of 6 billion

investigation and asked me to head it up my top staff personnel a congressman jim mcgovern and i traveled to el salvador to investigate these murders for 2 years we held meetings conducted interviews dug around we learned that the salvadoran soldiers not only committed the massacre but also were ordered to do so by the people at the highest levels of their military command who then engaged in a massive coverup reaching the highest levels of salvadoran government the very same salvadoran government to whom we were sending billions and billions of dollars after the moakley commission report was made public we eventually cut off all military aid to el salvador soon afterwards that civil war ended but today 10 years later our work towards human rights in central america has not ended in addition to learnfng who committed the jesuit murders we learned that 19 of those 26 implicated in those murders were graduates of the school of americas let me repeat nineteen of those 26 implicated in the jesuit murders were graduates of the school of americas the school of americas is a united states army school run in fort benning georgia that trains approximately 2 000 latin american soldiers

some of the cruelest dictators some of the worst abusers of human rights that the western hemisphere has seen and i think it is time for the united states of america to admit its mistakes and remove

layout plan of march 8 1999 the effect of this bill is to remove federal use restrictions on about 200 acres and let lawrence county use the land to meet local needs originally this property was part of a military air base it was transferred to alabama at the end of world war ii alabamas aeronautics commission ran the airport until 1980 when it sold it to tva the tva the tennessee valley authority sold it to lawrence county in 1985 lawrence county applied for and received an airport improvement program grant from the faa in the late 1980s at that time it submitted an airport layout plan showing the boundaries of the airport as containing about 600 acres on march 8 1999 the airport revised its airport layout plan the revised plan showed the airport as containing only 414 acres the faa believes the 1980s airport layout plan with 600 acres controls that is when the airport received its aip grant from the faa and promised to use its land only for airport purposes generally the committee on transportation and infrastructure vigorously defends the need to preserve airport land last year the subcommittee on aviation held a hearing on this subject and air 21 contains several procedural protections to help preserve our nations airports however in this case the gentleman from alabama has made a strong case for the need for this change he has shown that the airport really only requires 414 acres to handle the aviation needs of the community also it is my understanding that the faa now supports reducing the size of the airport to 414 acres but it does not feel it can do so without this legislation moreover the faa had previously given the airport a release from the deed restrictions on this land therefore for all these reasons i support this bill and urge its passage

additional reasons for pride because indeed she grew up spent many of her formative years in our great state capitol in albany but clearly to many of us her finest hours were upon this floor asid in our committee rooms where she served from 1983 until 1997 her achievements her dedication particularly to nevadans is wellknown she spent a great deal of effort trying to work on issues involving such issues as federal wilderness national park policy public land use and nuclear waste disposal to name just a few her retirement left this house somewhat poorer in that we no longer had her here as an everyday presence to help this great body in its deliberations but clearly we can this afternoon and i would hope we would in fact honor those contributions that she so selflessly extended through her service on the committees of interior and insular affairs the committee on house administration and certainly amongst the more important efforts as chair of the appropriations subcommittee on military

gentleman from california seeks to change a line that is in the cara bill that reads as follows let me read this sentence to the members the cara bill provides currently that federal agencies using funds appropriated by this act may not apply any regulation on lands until the lands or water or an interest therein is acquired cara already does that it says in effect that before the government actually acquires a land it cannot impose any regulations or limitations on use on that land even though it proposes to buy that land cara also says unless authorized to do so by another act of congress that gives the gentleman from california some trouble and other members some trouble but let me tell my colleagues what that means what that means is that congress has in effect passed laws that regulate property not all of which i agree with not all of which many of us agree with congress has passed laws to protect for example mining in public parks and recreational areas and wilderness areas to protect against certain activities in those parks it certainly has passed a lot of laws and regulations aimed at protecting species that are endangered and threatened and the wetlands and a whole host of federal environmental protective legislation that does affect potentially the use of their property cara also includes the language i should point out to my friend the gentleman from california of the fifth amendment it restates it it says that whenever any property under cara or otherwise is affected by a taking under the fifth amendment due compensation is going to get paid but cara does precisely what the gentleman from california wants it says that until the government actually acquires the property that is proposed to be acquired no new regulatory authority is granted under this act that does not already exist in some other act now i would like to change some of those other acts i know the gentleman from california would too but that is not what we are doing today we are discussing cara and we are talking about a problem that the gentleman from california has and i agree with him it does happen but agencies do on occasion try to impose regulations on proposed acquisitions and those things do happen it is unfortunate the gentleman from california and i went over some examples of that cara tries to cute that and says so very clearly no regulations under cara can be imposed upon proposed acquisitions until the government takes title it is as clear as a bell cara does correctly recognize however that there are other acts of congress that may impose certain restrictions on the private use of private property if they impose a taking cara provides compensation rights under the fifth amendment and that is precisely what cara ought to do the amendment of the gentleman from california would seek to interfere with those other statutes through this bill i do not think this is the place to do it and the amendment of the gentleman from california therefore would cause some real problems not only with this bill but many other statutes such as those that protect against mining in yellowstone park for example i would suggest that this amendment needs to be

by congress that it has not done its job so is the appropriation bill that follows this continuing resolution we were elected to use our judgment our experience to use our discretion to get the best value out of the american taxpayers money what do we do with an acrosstheboard cut it is nothing less than abdication of the judgment that we were elected to use it whacks the budget across the board by 1 percent cutting the good with the bad now that may sound minimal one percent sounds trivial but if it is minimal why not go back through these 13 bills and do it using discretionary judgment picking out things that have been larded into these bills member adds and we can start with senator lors helicopter landing ship just one of many things that cost several hundred million dollars that we can do without the navy said so did not want it did not ask for it one percent is not minimal if someone is one of the people who have been hurt by the cut as my colleagues know we have spent the better part of this year this past year trying to get veterans health care up to the level that the committee on veterans affairs itself says we need to fund it at in order to keep our promises made to the men and women who served our country particularly in time of war and if there are any promises we ought to keep we ought to keep the promises we made to our veterans what does this bill do we have got the veterans health care up by 1 5 1 7 million it whacks it 200 million that is health care veterans will not be able to get if this bill were to become law we spent last year the whole past year trying to get funding for our men and women in uniform our armed services up to the level where they want to stay in the service and encourage others to join the service because recruitment and retention are off both badly what does this bill do the appropriations bill that will come after this continuing resolution will whack our men in uniform to the tune of 28 000 men and women on active duty who will have to be involuntarily separated removed from service what in the world will that do to morale when we are trying to encourage retention and recruitment kicked out of the service mindless acrosstheboard cuts general shelton summed up the effects yesterday when he said a 1 percent acrosstheboard would be devastating to our national defense but that is what we are proposing here today all of this mindless carnage to the budget is being done in the name of holding social security surplus harmless and it is a worthy goal but i suggest to my colleagues in truth this is not the real goal the real goal is to send these 13 appropriation bills to the president have them veto several of them and then we will be able to say he is responsible for our having to borrow this year from social security well that dog will not hunt do not take my word for it listen to what cbo says this morning just off the press in its summary of 12 bills that this republican majority and this house and the senate have passed the last to come laborhhs it summed them all up and here is the summary right here on this chart in the simplest possible terms for people to understand the appropriations spending cap for this year in july was 580 billion at that level cbo said we would have a surplus this year of 14 billion 14 4 to be exact so that means if you spend 594 billion the cap on appropriations plus the onbudget surplus you can stay out of social security but cbo says today looking at all 13 appropriation bills that they spend altogether 611 billion simple arithmetic says therefore these bills to date are 17 billion already into the social security trust fund 17 billion already into the social security surplus because these bills to date spend 611 billion as opposed to a spending ceiling of 594 billion if you want to stay out of social security there it is in simple form in more complicated form i have a letter here dated october 28 1999 from dr drippen who is the director of cbo which i would like to insert in the record it sets it straight it spells it out you are already 17 1 billion into social security that is the bottom line no way around it let us vote down the laborhhs bill so we can get down to reality and get down to budgeting rather than blaming which is what the people elected us to do i include the following for the record"],

startup loans that will be repaid by the people it is basically using precious foreign aid dollars in the best possible way that we can spend them now what this amendment would doand why i think it makes so much sense is it would bring the level of this particular category up to the authorized level as already pointed out that has been passed by this congress and i would submit that there is no
