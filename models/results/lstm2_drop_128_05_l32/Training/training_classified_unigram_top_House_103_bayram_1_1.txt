be fully aware but by extending 20 percent copays to the only two programs in medicare that do not require copayment that is lab tests and home health care we only do that by the way for those above the 150percent level of poverty and by asking highincome beneficiaries over 70 000 a year to pick up a little bit larger share of the subsidized premiums i guarantee you that any serious health care reform package will have copayments in its including the presidents package now let us look a little bit at the presidents package the clinton plan will cut 124 billion out of medicare not 35 billion as in our plan but 20 billion of this are the same cuts that are in the pennykasich plan lab tests and part b premiums both the only thing clinton does not address is home health care all medical care costs wherever they are are fungible that is the savings in one plan can be spent on additional things in another program all up and down the line that is the foundation of the clinton health care reform plan to say that we cannot pull anything out of this is absurd the clinton plan cuts medicare 124 billion medicaid 85 billion raises 90 billion of taxes it increases medicare expenditures by 131 billion medicaid and public health by 170 billion clinton health care plan savings medicare 124 m edicaid 65 tax hikes 90 expansion under plan medicare 131 m edicaid 170 deficitreduction 58 cushion 45 total 103 pennykasich health care plan savings 35 expansions 0 it should be understood that the 65 billion included here for longterm care does not go to the elderly it goes into disability programs the new programs for drug assistance and longterm care require full copayments and state mandates their criticism of pennykasich is disingenuous and hypocritical and if you believe their numbers after all is said and done they have a cushion of 45 billion built into the total 5year plan that claims deficit reduction of 58 billion so pennykasich does not cut away from any other program or other use of savings it simply identifies part of the savings and proposes deficit reduction and moves them slightly forward in time in the end if the clinton plan is adopted we would still have 58 billion in deficit reduction even with pennykasich pennykasich simply fixes some of it now and moves it forward into the current year to the extent of about 3 billion this my colleagues is the most commonsense serious deficit reduction package i have seen in my 8 years in congress let us not let the country down"], [0.9807098563760519, 0.019290143623948097, 1, "madam chairman i move to strike the requisite number of words madam chairman anyone listening to the debate knows america is not safe the world is a perilous place i think all the members on both sides of this amendment would agree we need a good costeffective intelligence system the question is really whether or not what we are doing today is costeffective there is another question which is put into perspective not only is the world not safe but america is not safe it is not safe to walk the streets in many places in america they could be made safer with more police something the president has promised and something that we have had difficulty reducing in our budget with this classified amount of money that we are cutting out of this budget my rough estimates are from my days as a county commissioner we could put 56 000 deputy sheriffs in patrol cars on the road fully armed and equipped for the same amount of money or urban police would probably be close to that number now of course the russians can take that number and they can quickly go back and check on my county budget and they can interpolate how much money we might be cutting out of the budget here and soon hey will know that we are cutting somewhere near 3 billion and america will be less safe because the russians know that we cut 3 billion out of this budget how much are we spending well i cannot tell you that it is classified what are we doing with the money are we fighting terrorism are we fighting the cold war are we fighting some other adversary well i cannot tell you that but we know that every single dollar in this classified budget is wellspent better spent than any other part of the government this is not like any other government undertaking or agency not a penny is wasted that is what our colleagues would have us believe i do not believe that i am from the government and i am here to protect you that is what we are talking about here today believe us and spend this amount of money do not make them make the tough choices i read one article that said we cannot possibly lay off the people in the intelligence agency that article was such an insult to the people in those agencies that they simply could not lay them off because they are also laden with secrets that one might become disgruntled upon losing his or her job and reveal some of those secrets i do not believe anybody in our intelligence agency would do that if they knew that for the good of those agencies and for the good of america and to cut the deficit they had lost their jobs just like my loggers are losing their jobs just like people who work in military bases are losing their jobs everybody across america has to give and give equally what possible solace could the russians or muammar qadhafi or saddam hussein take from knowing how much money we are spending why not reveal the baseline number what advantage could they gain what they would know is that we are spending more than their gross domestic product on our intelligence agencies i think they would be pretty depressed if they saw how much money we are spending in this budget because they would know they could never possibly match it if they spent every penny available to them to have their own counterintelligence services there is a lot of talk about the exsoviet union or russia the gentleman from vermont made the most telling point of the day i did not vote for a single penny for our exadversary russia or the soviet union and now many of our colleagues have voted to send them billions of dollars in aid are going to tell us we cannot cut a few billions of dollars out of this secret intelligence budget because of the threat presented to us by russia or the exsoviet union why are we sending them money if we still feel so threatened and if they are not so much of a threat why do we still need to spend so much money terrorist acts i think terrorism is the new threat to america and to world stability in many cases particularly with nuclear terrorism what percentage of the budget is spent on that how effectively is it spent there is not being effective oversight of that this is all being done in secret and secrecy does not lie well with a full democratic republic america could do better let us come level with the american people let us tell them how much money we have spent how much money we spent to win the cold war in overtaking the threat of the soviet union let us compare that to how much money we are spending today let us tell them how much money we are spending today let us at least lay out some of the categories of the budget and let people see some gross numbers and let our colleagues here make some decisions on whether or not it is well spent just like we do with every other budget in this body every other budget

bill left the house it had no earmarks in it it now has 290 million of which 70 million are academic earmarks in which my committee on science space and technology has a jurisdictional interest there are of course in addition to that considerably more earmarks the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee said that he had received large numbers of requests for increased funding apparently between the time the bill left the house and it emerged from conference i might point out and i will include tables and charts with my remarks that 60 percent of these magical requests came from members of the conference com mittee the other 40 percent came from close friends of the conferees my objection is not to the project my objection is to the process here none of these was authorized none were requested apparently they could not meet the criteria for community development block grants but they magically appear there were none in the house bill the senate bill had 135 million and in conference the compromise was to extend it to 290 million that is the kind of mathematics that puzzles the people of this country how we would compromise zero and 135and come up with 290 the point i have been making now for several years and i will continue to make it until this situation is corrected is that we have an orderly process for considering expenditures in this house generally speaking they originate with a request they go to the authorizing committee where they are considered they are authorized and then as an authorized program they go to the appropriators to determine the level of funding all of that is thrown out the window here and we have the members of the appropriations committee all dear friends of mine who exercise tremendous power as illustrated in this conference report doing what they will and what they will to do is to use the taxpayers money to fund in this particular case nearly 300 million of programs most of which benefit the conferees themselves this process will destroy the comity of this house this will destroy the sense of the members of the authorizing committee that they are coequal members of this particular branch of government they are ruining our relationship with the senate because as i pointed out most of this originates in the senate and our dear friends on the house appropriations committee are almost forced into playing the
