was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved

deficit reduction this package may include some elements which all of us would prefer to see done a little differently however our house committees acted in good faith to meet their reconciliation directives some committees when back more than once to come up with sufficient savings this measure therefore represents the collective wisdom of our house committee on how to best meet their reconciliation target one committee the banking finance and urban affairs committee has already enacted its reconciliation savings the budget reconciliation act of 1987 would reduce the deficit by 24 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 80 1 billion over the next 3 years when scored against the budget resolution baseline this measure would reduce the deficit by more than 14 5 billion in fiscal year 1988 when scored against the grammrudmanhollings baseline as you know it is imperative for the federal government to reduce the large budget deficits which have weakened the economy enlarged the trade deficit and eroded our international competitiveness and financial security this bill represents our commitment to achieving substantial deficit reduction as required by adoption of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1988 and as required under the amended grammrudmanhollings law it includes substantial restraint on spending as well as revenue increases for fiscal year 1988
