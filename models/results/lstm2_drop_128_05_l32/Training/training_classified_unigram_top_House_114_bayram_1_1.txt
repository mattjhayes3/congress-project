forecasting for example forecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen and when forecasts can provide more lead time especially of severe weather events to allow people to prepare forecast information can be communicated more effectively to the public and those in harms way so we can reduce the loss of life and property this bill is designed to make sure that noaa achieves these important goals h r 1561 draws upon the model of innovation used by the military services where researchers work hand in hand with those on the front lines to develop innovations that have realworld practical returns the bill connects the research side of noaa the office of oceanic and atmospheric research more effectively with the forecasting needs of the national weather service the bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between oar and nws it also establishes new ways for noaa to hear from and work with the broader research and private weather communities noaa is not the only agency that researches weather or has responsibility for communicating forecast information so the bill establishes interagency coordination through the office of science and technology policy across the agencies that have these responsibilities this coordination will leverage our limited resources and more rapidly spread the adoption of best tools and practices across agencies h r 1561 recognizes that the best forecasts in the world will not fully serve the publics needs unless we have an effective communications system the bill directs noaa to do more research listen to experts and improve its risk communication techniques the bill also reestablishes a program that allows noaa to make awards to people who save the lives of others through reliance on noaas weather radio all hazards program this bill also establishes a pilot program at noaa to look to the commercial sector for weather forecasting data this is an overdue effort to ensure that federal dollars are spent effectively and leveraged appropriately additionally the bill requires noaa to run simulations of the effect of different configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting accuracy so the agency can look at the benefits and costs of different arrays of sensors it is important to make sure that these requirements are not too prescriptive so that noaa is able
