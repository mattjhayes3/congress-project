public employees ohio senate bill 5 is a measure currently under consideration by the ohio general assembly that would strip state workers of collective bargaining rights i firmly support the right of public employees to collectively negotiate who are we as a nation when we tell our firefighters and our police officers and other public protectors that they should have no say in their working conditions does a teachers experience or education have no economic value ohios proposed legislation is less about fiscal responsibility than an overt political attack on public workers who speak with a collective voice as labor battles erupt in state capitals around the nation a majority of americans say they oppose efforts to weaken the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions according to the latest new york times cbs news poll americans are against cutting the pay or benefits of public workers to reduce state budget deficits we shouldnt forget the benefits that collective bargaining offers for almost 28 years collective bargaining has reduced labor strife it has reduced the likelihood of strikes improved training and productivity among public employees created a sense of job security and it is fair it is fair to all working people the repeal of collective bargaining will do nothing to balance the budget nine percent of the states budget is for state employees so just as an example if we fired every state employee in ohio it would save us only 2 billion leaving the state without vital services and there would still be a 6 billion deficit since this does not address the budget deficit it is clear that antiworker forces are using this to harm middleincome workers and to kill jobs i would like to share a observation with you that was from a former president of the united states and i quote republicans stand foursquare for the american homebut not for housing they are strong for laborbut they are stronger for restricting labors rights they favor minimum wagethe smaller the minimum wage the better they endorse educational opportunity for allbut they wont spend money for teachers or for schools they think modern medical care and hospitals are finefor people who can afford them that is the philosophy of the masters of the republican party these are the words of president harry truman and they were spoken in 1948 these words ring as true today as they did in 1948 we have made too many advances over the past generations and americans should not be forced to choose between a job and their rights we cannot and should not return to the days when public workers had limited rights to bargain the middle class was created and has been sustained by collective bargaining and other labor protections the public sector is about working families

markey for the opportunity to speak on this important issue i also like to thank chairman doc hastings for his leadership every year thousands of federal rules or regulations governing almost every aspect of society are conceived through the federal rulemaking process consequently federal agencies perform quasilegislative functions and in many ways serve as an extension of congress this notion of an unelected entity having such tremendous impact on society rests uneasily with democratic theory for this reason a critical feature in our democracy is to control excessive bureaucratic discretion and to ensure that rules and regulations promulgated by federal agencies are consistent with the intent of congress as expressed in the law the administrative procedure act apa of 1946 exists for this purposeto constrain excessive bureaucratic discretion through procedural requirements for agency decision making including setting goals and standards for regulations and ensuring public participation through notice and comment other statutory rulemaking requirements applicable to a wide range of agencies include the regulatory flexibility act the paperwork reduction act the unfunded mandates reform act and the information quality act these statutory requirements established a clear process for agency rulemaking and standard by which the quality of regulations should be measured i appreciate the concerns of my republican friends that there are problems with many federal regulations over the years we have seen evidence of excessive bureaucratic discretion that result in federal regulations being too burdensome costly counterproductive and even prohibitive critics argue that mundane requirements have led to the ossification of the rulemaking process which at times could mean years before the final regulations are put in place meanwhile federal regulations are derived from the laws that are enacted by congress these laws are put in place to safeguard public interest without federal regulations though we could have situations such as the recent deepwater oil spill in the gulf of mexico the lack of regulatory oversight contributed to one of the biggest oil spills in the country in which the deepwater well released about 200 million gallons or 4 9 million barrels of crude oil into the gulf of mexico over a period of 84 days to prevent such environmental disaster in the future we need stronger federal regulations to ensure that appropriate standards are in place i support a more common sense approach to federal regulations federal agencies should strive to protect the public interest and to ensure that proposed regulations do not stifle economic growth and job creation for this reason i am pleased that president obama has ordered a government wide review of federal regulations to root out those regulations that stifle job creation and make our economy less competitive as the lawmaking institution in our system of government we also have a

and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the

conventional oil the recent exxon pipeline spill in montanas yellowstone river serves as a stark reminder of the very real risks posed by these kinds of pipeline projects however in discounting these facts the proponents of keystone xl assert that without the new pipeline canadas dirty tar sands oil will be shipped to china and to other overseas markets this simply isnt true without access to a major new shipping terminal and refining hub on the gulf coast canadas tar sands will remain stranded on the north american continent indeed keystone xl is essential to the economic expansion of canadian tar sands because it opens up new trade routes to the east current pipeline infrastructure carries tar sands oil to the midwest but no further by 2015 existing markets will no longer be sufficient to absorb this increased tar sands production so the keystone xl pipeline will provide that new market to china for this oil indeed earlier this year the ceo of valero energy one of the companies that has signed up to ship oil through keystone xl said this that the future of refining in the united states is in exports so america is increasingly now the global middleman in world oil exports our oil exports have doubled in the last 5 years the question is this shouldnt we have some say in where our oil goes with the construction of this new pipeline we are going to be shouldering

talking about a class in understanding the economy of this great nation less than 1 percent of americans own 42 percent of americas wealth and worse than being poor more americans who thought they reached the middle class wake up each and every day and find out that theyre back into poverty cant we find some way to realize that this is not a party issue that these are the principles of the united states of america dont we know that these debates that were having as to who can be the meanest and most ridiculous is causing us as a nation to lose the principles and arent these principles how do we treat the lesser of our brothers and sisters in this country isnt the question of how we treat our children is that gone out of the window our aged our sick and those in poverty isnt there something when middle class people have to watch the cash register when theyre paying out at the counter to make certain that they didnt pick up more than they can pay for what about having your possessions put in the street for nonpayment of rent theyre looking for unemployment compensation checks as a way of life they have to explain this no we have to get back our dignity as a nation and it doesnt include the gridlock that we have in the house of representatives sure getting elected is important but fulfilling the american dream is far more important than anything this nations based on yes god bless america yes in god we trust lets hope that god trusts us"], [0.08079123497009277, 0.5807912349700928, 1, "i make a point of order against consideration of this bill because the

in pingree me shuler that it is not in order to consider a bill if it has the effect of increasing spending for the current year and a 5year window cbo estimates this bill will cost 500 million over 5 years without an offset in the bill 1630 as you can see we are setting paygo aside and instituting cutasyougo which means if there is any spending called for in any new way or authorization that there has to be some cutting somewhere eric cantor further the speaker said very simply under the cutgo rule if it is your intention to create a new government program you must also terminate or reduce spending on an existing government program of equal or greater sizein the same bill i would point out as we already know on january 5 there was a violation of the rules where members failed to take the oath when they were not in the room on february 9 failed to offer a proper constitutionality statement with legislation that was offered on march 3 failed to require a threefifths majority for the passage of a bill that raised tax rates on march 17 we failed to make legislation available for 72 hours and now we are failing to include an offset for a new government program required under these rules under cutgo in order for these rules to be taken seriously we cant simply say because its a favorite program of the speaker were going to waive the rules the rules are there for a reason we voted on those rules and they were made an important part of the change of hands in this house when you have statements like this by the speaker they should be taken seriously there is no argument that the funds in this bill are simply not paid for and i insist on my point of order"]]}
