very thing that we should be working on to reduce costs such as medical supplies and other practices will be taxed pacemakers will be taxed heart monitors will be taxed artificial joints will be taxed the knees and hips that people will have replaced will be taxed stents diabetes supplies and prescription drugs are going to be taxed that tax is an increase in the cost of health care and something that has to be paid for which gets paid for by increasing the cost of insurance employers also have to pay increasing taxes if they dont have enough insurance or if they have no insurance for their employees and if they have too much insurance for their employees instead of rewarding them and saying this is good that you are providing comprehensive insurance for employees that gets taxed as well and employees themselves if they are not covered they have to pay taxes or because the way this bill works because there is no time frame they can get it when they are in the ambulance on the way to the hospital another point part of the funding for this is to take 70 billion from a longterm health insurance plan called the community living assistance services which is the class act before it even starts they will take 70 billion out of this over 10 years but what happens is the premiums will need to be paid in actual claims actually it is far less than will be needed now if any of us tried to start an insurance plan and took all of the money out before it even got started well you wouldnt be able to get a license to provide that insurance it is one of the many flaws in this

dollar food for peace program regardless of its perceived merits our country is deep in debt and we have problems here in america particularly rural america that need to be addressed the food for

is over 1 billion we stand today with a 14 3 trillion deficit and at the same time we have unmet needs in our own backyards my first amendment cuts 200 million from this program and my second amendment sets aside 100 million into the spending reduction account then of the 200 million cut in my first amendment 100 million each is directed into rural development title iii here in the united states the reason for these amendments is straightforward parts of rural america rival parts of some third world countries where we send tens of millions of dollars we need to focus on our own people and our own communities before we spend taxpayer money in foreign lands one example here in the united states is the area known as the former bennett freeze area an area consisting of 1 5 million acres of navajo nation reservation land where the housing units have been described as little more than hovels and 80 percent of the homes have no electricity and there are few paved road or communication structures how do we justify spending 1 billion in foreign countries when we have so many unmet needs in the united states the rural development loan program would receive additional funding under this amendment a program that gets high marks for its success so too would the multifamily housing revitalization program with millions of people losing homes they are moving into multiunit housing this program will help americans it is easy to understand the emotional appeal programs like food for peace may have a program that would be reduced by this amendment but ultimately we are using taxpayer money for charity improving literacy reducing hunger and educating girls in foreign countries are issues that are in fact charitable and emotionally appealing but we have our own literacy hunger and gender issues in our country but at a time when we have a 14 3 trillion public debt massive unemployment and rural rates of poverty illiteracy and school underperformance we should focus our money here at home we owe it to our constituents the taxpayers to help them certainly one can see that this program has laudable aspirations but laudable aspirations will not help the unitedstates economy or the unitedstates taxpayer the problems in rural america are staggering on june 9 2011 president obama issued an executive order to create a commission to study problems in rural america in the executive order the president stated sixteen percent of the american population lives in rural counties strong sustainable rural communities are essential to winning the future and ensuring american competitiveness in the years ahead these communities supply our food fiber and energy safeguard our natural resources and are essential in the development of science and innovation though rural communities face numerous challenges they also present enormous economic potential the federal government has an important role to play in order to expand access to capital necessary for economic growth promote innovation improve access to health care and education and expand outdoor recreational activities on public lands i agree but instead of just forming a committee

rural housing voucher program and the rural business program account which provides loan guarantees and grants for rural businesses development programs including business grants to indian tribes and rural economic partnership zones for farm and rural development again instead of just studying the problems of high unemployment lagging schools lagging infrastructure and opportunities lets do something about it the rural american poverty rate has exceeded the national rate since 2001 by 3 percentage points the child poverty rate in rural america is 5 percentage points higher than urbanmetro areas why cant we invest millions in our rural communities instead why should we tolerate poverty unemployment and a lack of infrastructure in our rural communities while we send millions

within 5 years as part of that plan the department must account for staffing requirements investments and infrastructure and the justification and rationale for technology choices and deployment locations since 9 11 this nation has spent billions of dollars to increase security along our borders weve doubled the size of the border patrol built 700 miles of fence and have invested in technology such as uavs and a wide array of surveillance equipment for use along the border most of these investments have been worthwhile yet instead of spending money in an ad hoc fashion the department of homeland security needs to develop a comprehensive and coherent plan to achieve control of the border while taking into account personnel technology and infrastructure needs the need for a comprehensive strategy is apparent as previous border security efforts succeeded in shifting smuggling and illicit activities from urban areas of the southwest border to more rural and remote areas such as arizona however this balloon effect has only succeeded in shifting the problem how we determine or measure what a secure border looks like has been the subject of a lot of debate but the fact remains that the congress and the american people should have a verifiable way to determine if we are making progress along the border for years weve relied on operational control as sort of a proxy for border security and it has become a de facto term but at the last count only 44 percent of the southwest border was under operational control and less than 2 percent of the northern border was adequately secured in 2010 the department of homeland security stopped reporting the numbers of miles of border under operational control and as yet has really not supplied an alternative measure of border security to replace the discarded operational control measure just a few weeks ago the border patrol released its new 2012 strategic plan which makes no mention of operational control it is clear that the department believes operational control is probably not the right measure to describe security at the border and is working on something called the border condition index which is supposed to be a holistic measure to inform our border security efforts i think we are all open to a new more robust standard if it supplements operational control and better describes what is happening with security at our border to this point i dont think we can automatically assume that this new measure stacks up against operational control with an issue this important we just cant change the rules if we dont like the results so if the secretary of the department of homeland security decides to use a measure other than operational control this bill would require that any other measure of border security would be vetted by a national laboratory with prior expertise in border security i think that boils down to trust but verify security along the border is more often than not described in terms of fences border patrol agents uavs and camera towers however that is only one side of the story we also need to increase security at our ports of entrythe conduit to much of the commerce and cargo that sustains our way of life this bill requires the secretary to develop a measure which gauges our progress at the points of entry so that when combined with operational control or its successor we have a very full picture of our border security the men and women of the united states border patrol and the unitedstates customs and border protection have a very difficult job i know that we all want to thank them for the very hard work that they do in some very demanding conditions to help secure our nation certainly it is our hope that the requirement for a comprehensive strategy will inform the congress of the resources needs of the department of homeland security will give the men and women on the border the tools that they need and will move us toward a more secure border both at and between the ports of entry i certainly would encourage all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0008472204208374023, 0.4991527795791626, 1,

federal debt its often said that our children and future generations will pay for the choices we make today but the truth is that were incurring debt at such a rapid pace that well begin to pay that price sooner than expected well pay now as well as later as public debt continues to grow including borrowing from foreign nations such as china interest costs alone are soaring into the stratosphere our economy our military strength and the opportunity for future growth are at risk if this problem is not addressed more quickly thats why i will stand here today to support h j res 2 a balanced budget amendment since first coming to washington in 1997 i have cosponsored legislation that would adopt a balanced budget amendment to the constitution this critical legislation would require the federal government to balance its budget like most states are required to do in fact 49 of the 50 states have some form of a balanced budget requirement so this is not something novel or unusual its something that makes sense my home state of north carolina has one of the most stringent requirements to do so lets stand together today for common sense lets send a message to the american people
