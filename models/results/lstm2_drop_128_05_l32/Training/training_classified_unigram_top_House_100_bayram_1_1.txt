factor this program has been the key to the rapid increase in sensitivity to the needs of the disabled and the protection of their rights i would like to underscore provisions in the bill i offered in subcommittee the developmental disabilities program has its origins in a 1963 law which applied only to individuals who were mentally retarded over time congress has expanded the definition so that those efforts now include a broad spectrum of functional limitations currently under the law a developmental disability includes any severe chronic disability which a is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments b is manifested before the person attains age 22 1 c is likely to continue indefinitely d results in substantial functional limitations in 3 or more areas of life activity i selfcare ii receptive and expressive language iii learning iv mobility v selfdirection vi capacity for independent living and vii economic selfsufficiency and e reflects the persons need for a combination and sequence of special interdisciplinary or generic care treatment or other services which are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated in our hearings we learned that many states construe the definition far more narrowly as a result many eligible individuals are not being reached in many states disabilities attributable to physical impairments such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy or developmental disabilities attributable to a combination of mental and physical impairments are not reached by the advocacy and planning of the state councils which administer this program the bill before us would require each state to develop a process to identify those individuals and report to congress on ways of fully serving the developmentally disabled population states would be required to hold public hearings to bring out the views and recommendations of developmentally disabled individuals and advocacy organizations the goal of the program is to assure that persons with developmental disabilities receive the care treatment and other services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence productivity and integration into the community the failure of states to properly respond to the definition of developmental disabilities now results in this program being an unfulfilled promise to 1 million individuals and their families it is certainly my hope that this provision will send a strong signal to the states that they should move toward fully serving all of the developmentally disabled i would like to share with my colleagues the testimony of ms eileen cubarney of allison park pa in which she poignantly and

at the time there was widespread concern in the congress that we were simply avoiding our responsi bility as legislators to make the hard choices necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit however the main rationale for restoring the trigger was to put pressure on the president to face the deficits which have accumulated during his presidency having restored the trigger we have also committed ourselves to producing a responsible reconciliationbill and appropriationbills which in the aggregate will prevent sequestration if the house passed the reconciliation bill which is now before us we will have taken a positive step toward giving the american people and the president a choice between acrosstheboard mindless budget cuts and a reasoned package which combines responsible spending reductions and prudent revenue increases let us be clear about the significance of todays vote a vote against this reconciliation bill is a vote in favor of sequestration a vote against this reconciliation bill will undermine the budget summit and send a very negative signal to our financial markets as chairman of the committee on ways and means i would like to describe the spending reductions and revenue increases which were developed by the committee and are contained in titles ix and x i the total deficit reduction reported by the ways and means committee is 14 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 62 billion for the 3year budget window the committee has more than met its outlay reduction instruction under reconciliation and has satisfied the revenue requirement placed on the committeeby the passage of house joint resolution 324 to avoid sequestration for fiscal year 1988 these totals break down to 1 6 billion in outlay reductions and 12 billion in revenues for fiscal year 1988 through 1990 the outlay reductions are 8 billion and revenue increases are equal to 53 bllion let me discuss each of these packages separately title ix of the recon ciliation bill contains the committees spending cuts the committee on ways and means was assigned savings in the medicare program of 1 5 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 8 7 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions of the committee package together with the provisions of the recently enacted debt ceiling bill reduce spending by 1 6 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 9 0 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions are carefully designed to achieve the assigned savings targets in a balanced fashion the committee distributes the reductions fairly amonghospitals and physi clans and does not affect beneficiaries in fact a committee provision that strengthens the participating physician program should reduce outofpocket health costs of the elderly and disabled by increasing the payment differential to 5percent the committee hopes to encourage more physi cians to agree always to accept the octber29 1987 h 9168 october 29 1987 coi medicare reimbrusement as paymentinfull partricipating physicians now provide over 40 percent of medicare physician services the medicare provisions of the reconciliation bill are immeasurably preferable to a grammrudman sequester under a sequester all hospitals would receive an increasein medicare payments in fiscal year 1988 equal to 0 3 percent under the committee package hospitals generally receive a 1percent increase and hospitals in large cities and rural areas receive a 2 percent increase moreover the reconciliation legislation blocks administration changes in capital reimbursement bad debt payments and outlier case policy all of which could reduce payments to hospitals significantly in order to improve the financial solvency of the pension benefit guaranty corporation the committee agreed to increase the annual insurance premium charged to single employer defined benefit pension plans and to impose a variable rate premium on underfunded plans the committee also agreed to recommendations relating to the minimum funding standards for underfunded plans employer access to plan assets in overfunded plans and the termination of underfunded plans the committee on education and labor has also reported recommendations regarding the pbgc while these provisions differ from those reported by the committee on ways and means the differences will be worked out in conference title ix also provides a 2year authorization of appropriations for the unitedstates international trade commission the office of the unitedstates trade representative and the unitedstates customs service at levels which will allow these agencies to effectively carry out our trade laws the authorization for the unitedstates customs service would not only restore the administrations proposed cut of 2 000 customs personnel but would add 800 new positions for commercial

billwhich gives governors both the flexibility they have sought and the resources they need to implement the program second with or without this motion the congressional budget resolution requires that welfare reform be budget neutral the cost of the bill will be determined by the policy decisions that are made in conference but the conference report that will be brought back to you will be

years despite an adverse court order and despite the damage to the federal budget the last time it was tried the department has again published a rule permitting permanent repayment of construction differential subsidy or cds as it is called this time theyve put out the rule even as conferees on the fiscal year 1987 supplemental appropriations bill are in the middle of considering the houses position opposing such a rule this rule is an outrage its timing is an insult finally it exposes some obvious political pressure that has been brought on the navy to coverup its longstanding opposition to cds payback for those who arent too familiar with cds let me provide a bit of background unitedstates flag vessels used in the foreign trades compete with subsidized vessels from many foreign nations to help them compete the government has in the past assisted in paying ship construction costs through the cds program unitedstates flag vessels used in the domestic trades do not compete with foreign vessels and so have not received any cds when shipments of alaska oil boomed the domestic fleet for a time could not accommodate the demand for tankers based on that tanker shortage the maritime administration permitted two tankers to repay their cds and enter the domestic trade again when domestic vessel shortages could be documented marad also allowed several other foreigntrades tankers to enter the alaska oil trade for temporary periods of up to 6 months in return for repaying a pro rata portion of their cds the department of transportation in 1982 initiated the idea of permitting foreigntrades vessels to permanently repay cds without the need for determining whether there was a need for their capacity in the domestic trades congress wouldnt accept that proposal congress correctly concluded that foreigntrades vessels shouldnt be allowed to repay cds if their switch to the domestic fleet would merely drive unsubsidized domestic vessels out of business the navy also objected pointing to the damage that would be done to the nations emergency preparedness if militarily useful domestic tankers were driven out of business congress blocked a cds payback rule in three separate appropriations bills during 1983 and 1984 in may 1985 however the barrier expired and the secretary of transportation quickly passed a rule permitting cds payback three vessels repaid cds and enterd the alaska oil trade but the court of appeals found the rule was arbitrarily and capriciously issued and vacated it last january the court said the three vessels would have to leave the domestic trade by midjuly even before the court decision the rule had proven to be a budgetary catastrophe although dot told congress to take a 200 million budget credit for the rule in the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution the rule wound up costing the budget 76 million thanks to fewer revenues and more related loan defaults that dot had projected despite this sorry experience with the rule on april 15 dot again proposed to issue the cds payback rule the house committee on appropriations already had voted on march 27 in favor of barring such a rule and the full house later adopted that position as part of the fiscal year 1987 supplemental appropriations bill that legislation is pending in conference right now but did the department pause for direction from congress on this issue no it did not on monday marad published a final cds payback rule effectively thumbing its nose at congress and at congress longtime opposition to cds payback it is very difficult to understand why dot and the administration are so much in favor of this rule its bad for the budget its bad for national defense its bad for jobs and it is of no benefit to consumers perhaps most puzzling of all has been the role of the navy in this proceeding without objection i would like to enter into the record five letters documenting the navys peculiar evolution on this issue first is a letter from assistant secretary of the navy sawyer to the secretary of transportation dated march 29 1983 this letter opposed cds payback for a number of national defense and other reasons second is a letter from assistant secretary of the navy pyatt to the maritime administration dated april 28 1987 this letter again opposed cds payback for reasons similar to those stated in 1983 third is a letter from marad to the navy dated may 6 1987 confirming the navys mysterious withdrawal of assistant secretary pyatts letter of 8 days earlier fourth is a letter from secretary of the navy webb to a private tanker operator in which he makes the following statement the cds payback rule was debated extensively within the administration during 1983 and 1984 the decision was taken to implement the rule in 1985 the reissue of the rule on 15 april 1987 was simply to correct the procedural problems found by the unitedstates court of appeals no new evidence has been presented which would warrant reopening debate within the administration on the issue fifth is a letter from assistant secretary pyatt to marad sent june 10 1987 nearly a month after the close of the comment period on the payback rule in this letter he retracts his letter of april 28 and says those comments were based upon a misunderstanding of the proposed rulemaking in that this is a technical correction to a prior rulemaking on this matter the navy supports the position of the administration as stated by the department of transportation i find these last three letters to be absolutely incredible how can the navy say there has been no evidence to warrant reopening the issue the original decision was made before a cds payback rule was ever tried then the rule was tried and turned out to be a budgetary disaster with all dot projections far off the mark isnt that new evidence if the navy took this approach to procurement it would approve the plans for a new kind of aircraft carrier watch the first carrier sink due to faulty design and then refuse to review the plans before building a second carrier to term the cds rule a technical correction of a prior rulemaking is an insult to the court of appeals the court of appeals didnt just find some technical element that needed fixingit found that the secretary essentially ignored the merchant marine act of 1936 and the statutory criteria it establishes for such regulations among other things the court said the secretarys response to concerns about the rules effects on the fleet as a naval auxiliary to take another example is similarly unsatisfying the court went on to point out some of the navys arguments and how she failed to properly respond to them for the navy to now forego its own excellent arguments and meekly call this major rulemaking a technical correction is ludicrous who i wonder forced assistant secretary pyattt to repudiate his position was it someone in the navy or someone higher in the department of defense or the administration white house officials have joined in misrepresenting the courts position one senior official told a member of congress that the administration had no choice but to issue the rule because the court had directed it to do so the court did no such thing after vacating the 1985 rule the court in an effort to avoid disruption in the fleet provided a 6month period in which the secretary could try again to issue a cds payback rule if she wished there was no requirement to issue such a rule and indeed the court said it took no position on whether it was even possible to square dots cds payback policy with the requirements of the merchant marine act in all this is a sorry record of rulemaking and an obvious slap in the face of congress by officials bent on pursuing a policy thats already been found to be wrong we need some answers and some accountability on how this happened i for one am going to pursue them i urge my colleagues particularly those with interests in defense and maritime policy to

mind the words of another great american in a speech delivered in 1858 in edwardsville il abraham lincoln addressed these words to his countrymen and i quote when you have succeeded in dehumanizing the negro when you have put him down and made it impossible for him to be but as the beast of the field when you have extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is burned out as in the darkness of the damned are you quite sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and wren you what constitutes the bullwark of our liberty and independence it is not our crown embattlements our bristling seacoast our army and our navy these are not our reliance against tyranny all of those may be turned against us without making us weaker for the struggle our reliance he said is in the love of liberty which god has planted in us our defense is in the spirit which prides liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands everywhere destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them accustom to trample on the rights of others and you have lost the genius of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you lincolns words uttered almost 130 years ago beckon to us at this hour and call our attention even more to the lessons and the legacy of martin luther king jr as in 1858 for president lincoln 1963 for dr king marked a year of outcry for equality it was the centennial of the emancipation proclamation and was observed by some with both disappointment and disillusionment thereafter though the words of dr king and many other unsung heroes gains were made goals were attained accomplishments were realized but even now in 1987 in yet another new year there is still a widespread outcry for equality many changes have come about across the nation but there is still unfinished business in the land we need a federal budget that emphasizes the needs of people a jobs creation program that guarantees a move toward full employment we need genuine social reform that can only come about through genuine leadership all of us working together to make a difference in our communities would be the greatest tribute to dr kings memory and it will take all of us to make a difference i

keep the status quo with regard to congressional salaries the only thing they have to do is return that money to the treasury jane 14 1988 the other thing is that i am concerned about those individuals who head important departments and who earn 72 500 in other words under this amendment no one who earns that amount of money will get an increase this includes customs agents who are in charge of the interdiction m narcotics secret service and all the law enforcement agencies of the federal government these agencies as we know have a tremendous responsibility first of all and those responsibilities deal with the interdiction of narcotics that come into our schools and universities on a daily basis so we are telling these individuals regardless of the job you do you are frozen at that level and you are not entitled to an increase regardless of increases in the cost of living i think that is a mistake and i commend the gentleman for the position he has taken"]]}
