priority i am hopeful that the adoption of this bill will mark the beginning of the end of deficit spending and the beginning of the long awaited deficit reduction process that makes that possible at the outset let me be clear about my position im not happy with the options presented to me today that is why i voted against the rule its disgraceful that we do not have the opportunity to work our will on the btu tax and other provisions which i and so many others do not support this measure does represent a comprehensive deficit reduction plan which will significantly reduce the deficitwhich is strangling our economyby 496 billion over the next 5 years deficit reduction will facilitate long term economic growth and productivity so that our children may inherit an america that is fiscally sound and capable of maintaining her position as the worlds leader in what is rapidly becoming a global economy the problems we are now facing are in large part a result of the past 12 years of misplaced priorities and tailed fiscal policy i believe that the reconciliation bill is a break from this harmful trend unlike the 1990 budget agreement which relied too heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending cuts and unlike the massive tax bill of 1981 which provided a plethora of tax cuts which drained our treasury of more than 2 trillion and increased the federal budget deficit by more than five times over the reconciliation bill offers real solutions to the very serious problems that have been plaguing our economy for far too many years there is one element missing from the plan before us today that i will not miss namely the phony economic assumptions and other irresponsible accounting gimmicks that the past two administrations have used to mask and sugarcoat the very serious economic problems our country faces i am confident that the sound straightforward and overall fiscal policy set forth in the reconciliation package will help chart the course for our economic recovery i certainly do not agree with every single detail of this package in particular the btu tax gives me heartburn i have been able to secure assurances from the administration that it was not the intent of the feedstock exemption to provide any undue competitive advantage for any industry even with that i question the wisdom of this particular tax and will continue to work for its elimination i could pick apart a number of other provisions i do not support but there pare dozens of provisions i do support besides no one has come forward with a package that will pass so what is the bottom line no billstalemate larger deficits and higher interest rates that is not a viable option on the other hand i am pleased that the reconciliation bill addresses all aspects of the budget including discretionary spending entitiement payments to individuals as well as the even unpopularrevenue side of the ledger this bill provides for some 246 billioni in spending cuts representing onehalf of the total deficit reduction moreover this measure recognizes that cutting discretionary spending alone will not be enough to achieve our longterm goals in this regard the bill establishes important provisions to slow the rate of growth of entitlement programs and control spending which accounts for more than onehalf of the national budget and is growing much faster than the economy as a whole although i am pleased to see that this bit includes some 200 cuts in spending programs i wanted to see even more cuts in such pro grams as the 30 billion space station the 10 billion superconducting super collider and other programs in the discretionary as well as the entitlement areas of the budget certainly i do not want to see any increases in taxesno one does however i do think it is time that we require the most affluent individuals and corporationsespecially foreignowned corporationsto start paying their fair share these groups have had a relatively free ride through the 1980s while the middle class has bome the brunt of the tax burden i am glad that the reconciliation package includes tax reforms which will restore equity to our tax system certainly supporting an economic reform package which generates any increased taxes is the hallmark example of the politically unpopular decision for example i have particular concerns about increasing the tax on the taxable portion of social security benefits from the current 50 percent to 80 percent in todays economy retired couples earning 32 000 and who are receiving social security benefits are certainly not the more affluent of society and i think it is ridiculous to classify them as such none of the decisions we have to make are really going to be easy i submit that any such cost in political capital pales in comparison to the price being paid by our children and grandchildren from the past years of inept fiscal policy our country is facing a grave financial crisis which calls for our forthright aggressive and timely action i am encouraged that the reconciliation bill contains key provisions which will assist in our economic recovery by establishing key investment incentives there are other reasons why a no vote on the package is problematic by not supporting the measure we will also be rejecting other very worthwhile provisions for example i am pleased that this bill will finally repeal the onerous luxury tax on boats which has wreaked havoc on the entire american boatbuilding industry everyday that this tax is in effect more boatbuilding companies are forced to close costing thousands of hardworking americans their livelihoods my colleagues may recall that we have twice voted for the repeal of this tax only to have these initiatives vetoed by formerpresident bush i am painfully aware of the debilitating effect of this tax indeed my own state of new jersey has been hardest hit with employment in the boatbuilding industry dropping nearly 90 percent since its enactment this is similarly reflected on a national scale with companies that build boats in the luxury tax range having dropping in employment by approximately 73 percent i am very gratified that the reconciliation bill will once and for all see that this illadvised tax is repealed furthermore the reconciliation bill modifies the passive loss rules for taxpayers who materially participate in rental real estate activities this provision alone will breath life back into the real estate industry which has been struggling to recover ukewise this bill establishes targeted capital gains provisions which will allow investors to exclude onehalf of the capital gains earned from longterm investment in small business we know from experience that small businesses create the lionsinvestment in such valuable business ventures furthermore this bill will extend perma nently the targeted jobs tax credit the lowincome home tax credit as well as the mortgage revenue bond and smallissue de velopment bond programs these credits have proven to be a tremendous benefit to the economy and i am very pleased that the reconciliation bill includes these worthwhile provisions so while this package is far from perfect i do believe that overall this is a plan that will put us on the right course for achieving our goals of deficit reduction and economic growth we are facing an economic crisis which requires our immediate attention the decisions to be made will not be easy yet they are critically necessary we will have a chance by advancing this bill to the senate to correct the deficiencies i have noted so that the conference report will be in a more acceptable form if that does not occur i will then have an opportunity to vote against it in its final form a rejection today denies us that option and presents us with the serious risk that the next reconciliation effort could be even more unacceptableif we can find one that will get 218 votes no moving this process along is the only responsible

have differences in political philosophy however i would say that in his case and mine perhaps the differences are not as distinct as in some other situations that come to mind but i do for the committee respectfully oppose the gentlemans amendment it seems to me that in dealing with a situation where we seek to find avenues to change educational patterns where we have designed legislation which allows local governments and state governments to use their sources of revenue to use local money tax money to enter into partnership with the federal government that the federal onethird match in many of those instances will prove to have been and will prove to be needed to keep the projects alive that as state governments in the future change and their attitude towards these operations change and as administrations change and perhaps their attitude toward this initiative changes that the last thing we need is for this program to have to experience the planned uncertainty of sunset provisions normally to put in legislation a mechanism whereby the procedure the program will selfdestruct sometime in the future that has appealed to me and to others of my colleagues but i do not think that we want to apply this selfdestruct mechanism to these new educational initiatives it seems to me that will discourage participation from the beginning and help to thwart the very purpose for which they are created i will say in conclusion that these manufacturing centers are an important source of local information on a variety of topics of importance to manufacturers who with to compete at home and abroad and they ought to be here to stay we ought not to put it out and say well we are going to put in here a mechanism whereby this initiative this program at a certain number of years will selfdestruct in the event of a positive evaluation that is the only way that the centers can be extended the secretary of commerce has responsibility to oversee the operation and there will not be a question as to whether or not this initiative is extended unless there is a positive evaluation so while i respect and admire my colleague from california we believe that in this instance his wellmeaning amendment should be rejected i mr walker i move to strike the last word and i rise in support of the amendment i wonder how many members of congress ran in their districts last year saying that one of the things we ought to do to reform government is to have sunset provisions to assure that programs dont go on and one and on forever without being reaffirmed that we ought to have a way of getting rid of some of these programs somewhere along the line there was a former president who said that the embodiment of eternal life on earth is itself a federal program the ugly truth of the language that is in this bill is that we are going to perpetuate the idea that a federal program once created is neverending let me tell my colleagues something that was not the deal when this program was originally put in place when this program was originally put in place we very specifically wanted these manufacturing centers that were being created to go out on their own after a 6year period let me quote to you from the law that was passed at that time the law says that no funding be provided for a center provided by the department of commerce after the sixth year of operation of a center in other words we gave them 6 years of funding after that period of time they were supposed to have proved their worth to the community and then they got their funding through private enterprise in other words we were taking public money and turning it over to private money we were stopping spending money that increased the national debt and we were putting the burden on industry on all those rich people out there that we hear so often we ought to be grabbing for more of the resources of government what does this decide to do it decides that those rich people ought not fund these centers but instead what we ought to do is continue to pile up public debt in order to fund these centers and so what the gentleman from california has done is said that the language in this bill is really at odds with the law that the sunset law that we put in place years ago ought to be upheld we ought not to do what this bill does if we go to page 39 and we look at lines 1 through 16 on page 39 of the bill we find this shocking retreat from reform here was an attempt in public law to do something real about sunset for once we had actually sunsetted a program we had said after 6 years the program gets no more public money then we go to page 39 of the bill and we find that we are retreating from that reform it is high time that we do something for real why are the american people disgusted with what goes on in the congress because every time we do something phony every time we tell them that we are doing something real about reform they find out later on that it was just a phony here we are a few years later and what we are saying is that little job we did back a while ago where we sunsetted a program forget it buried down in page 39 of this bill we are just going to wipe out the sunset provision and we are going to go right on spending money as though there was no tomorrow guess what it is money we are going to be piling on the backs of our kids because this is all debt money that is being spent to fund these centers now if my colleagues want to continue to accumulate public debt if they have no regard for the reforms of the past if they want to continue to tell the american people that everything we do here in terms of reform is a phony what they will do is support what the committee wants to do because the committee bill wipes out the sunset provisions if they want to be a reformer if they want to stick with the reforms of the past if they want to do something about debt and deficit if they want to stop spending the public money in places where the rich could actually pick up some of the tab then what they will do is they will support the gentleman from california because these manufacturing centers can in fact be sustained with private money we do not need to go to the public till we do not need to pile up more debt and we do not need to abandon reform we can support the gentleman from california we can retain the manufacturing centers but we can retain them in the way that they were originally meant to be done so i would suggest that we do want to support what the gentleman from california is suggesting here and stand on the side of reform
