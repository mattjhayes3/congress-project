engine of growth this budget and its deficits will put the brake on job creation do not take it from me chairman greenspan said just recently the federal budget deficit is on an unsustainable path in which large deficits result in rising interest rates and evergrowing interest payments that augment deficits in future years unless this trend is reversed at some point these deficits would cause the economy to stagnate or worse a missed opportunity because instead of being a blueprint of positive initiatives for the future this budget is an assault on our values the budget calls for 10 billion in

reckless republican budget does not stop with cuts in medicaid and social security its wrong priorities mean cuts in education medicare student loans and changes in the pension guarantee program which will cause american workers to lose their pensions democrats have a better idea during the last years of president clintons administration the entire social security trust fund surplus was saved and

conspire to restridt supply to the oil companies themselves who have dreated a black market that is a market where 75 percent of the oil is traded and retraded and retraded driving up the price for no good reason just to facilitate profits and then it is delivered to the refineries we see now that we have a refinery shortage well why do we have a refinery shortage actually that is pretty interesting ten years ago the american petroleum institute sent a memo to its members saying hey you are not making much money with refineries if you would facilitate the closing of refineries and squeeze down the availability of refinery capacity you could increase profits and then the r did in fact in the last decade through mergers and by action of individual corporations they have closed 55 refinbries in america now they want to blame the environmentalists and say there isnt enough refinery capacity those darn environmentalists guess what not one of the 55 refineries was closed because of environmental issues they were closed to increase profits the industry has become wildly profitable back in 2004 the refiners got 27 cents on each gallon of gas we bought last year they got 99 cents on each gallon of gas we bought four times higher that has nothing to do with supply and demand that is extortion of the american consumer the valero company now the biggest refiner in america their chief operating officer was asked about building more refineries apd said why would we want to do that we are doing very well the way thingsare the president claimed it was environmental

fact that exxonmobil last year had the largest profit of any corporation in history 36 billion in one year 10 million a day they were so awash in cash giving it back buying stock back giving out dividends and 400 million to their ceo who wasnt there very long it averaged out to a 135 000 pension a day for the time he worked at that company but there is no price gouging or profiteering going on here so the administration says no windfall profits tax they are going to look at gouging but they are not going to look into the corporate boardrooms they are going to go out and look at the corner gas stations that are getting record low margins as they are squeezed by this noncompetitive industry it is past time for congress to take definitive action first congress should subject the trading of oil to the same regulations as any other commodity wipe out the black market in oil where they are jacking up the price experts say that one simple step saying oil will be traded like every other commodity it will be regulated and overseen by the commodity futures trading commission something the bush administration doesnt want to do would drive down the price immediately by 25 cents by squeezing out the speculction impose a windfall profits tax on exxonmobil and others unless and except they use some of their obscene profits to build new refining capacity that could be exempt from the windfall profits tax give them a strong incentive to undo this little game they are playing on the american consumers make price gouging a fedetal crime right now you have to prove two companies colluded not just one set out to price gouge change the law and then opec remember the president told us he was goingto take on opec he was going to jump on opec he was going to do something about

for his leadership as well i rise in strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to improve environmental protection in central america and it will open up our own environmental laws to attack by foreign corporations my colleagues this cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new

been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this cafta does none of the above it does not

addition he practiced law and later served as a judge in 1860 abraham lincoln was elected president in the midst of a nation dissolving from within by the time of his first inaugural address in march seven states had already seceded from the union yet committed to doing everything in his power to prevent civil war president lincoln used his inaugural address to nake a stirring appeal for the preservatioh of the union ending his address by saying i am loathe to close we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature nevertheless in april fort sumter was attacked and the war began for 4 years lincoln was consumed with winning the war and salvaging the union and as the war finally neared its end in march 1865 lincoln focused on healing and reuniting a ravaged nation instead of rebuking or punishing the confederacy lincoln chose instead to offer a united vision of a healed country during his last inaugural address he said with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations i 1430 unfortunately he would not live to see the end of the civil war in april of 1865 just blocks from where we stand today lincoln was assassinated at

record of interpreting narrow language broadly to withhold public information unless there is a compelling reason why the existing foia exemptions are inadequatewhich there does not appear to be in this case it is unwise to add new exemptions to foia moreover the language of the new exemption is not clear the language applies to any advanced research and development that is funded by the secretary which may inappropriately extend the exemption far beyond barda to other research funded by the department of health and human services another issue is socalled other transaction authority this authority is essentially a waiver from most federal procurement law everything from competition requirements to auditing and pricing safeguards to the buy america and drugfree workplace laws the authority was originally developed to help dod in at tracting smaller contractors to federal research and development contracts though in practice it has not often been used to accomplish that

manufacturers should be sheltered from lawsuits claiming that their products cause someone to become obese i can understand their reasoning because there is a sense of personal responsibility involved but what my amendment would do is to limit that language so it is not so broad as to include what are called dietary supplements because some of these products are not like food they are not reviewed by the fda they are not even subject to fda intervention unless they can show real harm being done and we have had examples of ephedra and andro that have been withdrawn from the market because they caused serious injury or dhea which is a steroid precursor the bill authors would say that they want to protect from lawsuits when people say they have gained weight or there is obesity or health conditions associated with a persons weight gain or obesity imagine you are overweight and suffer from high blood pressure because you are overweight and you decide to try losing weight by taking a dietary supplement product but what you do not know is that the product you are taking contains a potentially dangerous stimulant and instead of helping you lose weight the product causes your blood pressure to go even higher and makes you really sick if this bill passed you could not sue the dietary supplement company even if the product did not have a warning label even if the companies received thousands of adverse event reports that they have kept hidden even if a professional medical society and experts have concluded that the product is dangerous and even if the company has never tested the product to see if it is safe removing the threat of liability for dangerous dietary supplements would be a grave mistake despite evidence that supplements containing ephedra are dangerous and have caused heart attacks or strokes or death it took the fda years to act to take higherdose ephedra supplements off the market th the meantime some dietary supplement companies stopped making ephedra products because of the mounting litigation without having to take responsibility for their products manufacturers could be free to sell dangerous substances to the public the threat of a lawsuit could have a real impact here and it is not one simply of personal responsibility we are seeing now a new generation of weightloss products marketed as dietary supplements that have stimulant ingredients that may be similar to ephedra according to a recent study these new products may raise blood pressure and heart rate making them potentially dangerous particularly to those people who already have heart disease however it is perfectly legal for a dietary supplement manufacturer to sell these products without testing to see if they are safe and without warning cofisumers of potential adverse effects this bill as it is drafted is a license for reckless behavior by dietary supplement manufacturers i do not know if that is what the authors intended i tend to think they

cases who filed a series of rule 11 motions to harass the men and women who challenged discrimination until now there has been no demonstrated problems with the current version of the rule usually this type of change in civil procedure goes through a process of the rules enabling act but in this instance we have decided to circumvent the united states judicial conference and the united states supreme court we have taken it upon ourselves tb decide what is best for the judicial system the lawsuit reduction act would amend rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure and revert back to that pre1993 status by doing this again we take away states discretion to impose sanctions on improper and frivolous pleadings this would eliminate the current safe harbor provision permitting the attorneys to withdraw improper frivolous motions within 21 days after they have been 6hallenged by an opposing counsel additionally this bill dictates where plaintiffs can file a personal injury lawsuit against a corporation in a state court do we really want to get into the jurisdictional battles in our states reverting back to the previous rule 11 would make people less likely to challenge

approached life washington is a diverse city a place where many maybe even most of those who live here come from other parts of the country and because of that the washington area is extraordinarily

to step back for just a moment and to take in the immense natural beauty and cultural offerings of this historic city that is just what phil merrill did for the people around him he inspired others to see that there actually is time in a busy life to do things like enjoy the outdoors in his case it was sailing and skiing and spenaing time with his beloved family that he so dearly loved for so long

and other minor offenders who get a suspended sentence for a crime that was committed 15 years ago could get a 5year mandatory minimfim sentence for a technical violation of a registration requirement such as showing up at 5 30 on the last day of registration when the office closed at 5 oclock or failing to register the fact that they are in a community college that has different sites do they have to register everywhere they might take a class or just the main registration place for the community college or if they work in construction if they register at the home office of the construction company do they also have to register at each location where they are doing construction if they guess wrong 5 years mandatory minimum no discretion on the part of the judge are our children going to be safer or less safe if an offender knows that he is in technical violation if he shows up to register after he has been in technical violation he knows he is looking at a 5year mandatory minimum is he going to show up or not it is also absurd that an offender would be sentenced to a minimum 5 years for giving a technically false statement regarding this registration when under the same section of the law there is a maximum of 8 years no minimum sentence for either making a false statement in connection with international or domestic terrorism a false statement on terrorism 8 years maximum no minimum technical violation on registration 5 years mandatory minimum 20 years possibility again this amendment retains the 20year maximum for cases such as those cited by the chairman but it allows common sense in determining which offenders would get what sentence for what violations we have been told by the sentencing commission and the judicial conference time and time again that

violates common sense they will get that time anyway in everyday experiences judges can see differences great and small in the facts and circumstances in the cases before them the name of the crime is often a poor indicator of the facts and cirdumstances of the crime so it makes sense to have a rational assessment by one who has heard and seen the evidence and facts and circumstances of the case making the appropriate decision within the guidelines set by the sentencing commission relating to the gradations in seriousness of the crime and the other characteristics that is why we set up the sentencing reform act that set up the sentencing commission and these mandatory minimums obviously violate that entire system of course under the federal system the ones who will primarily be affected will be native americans because they try all their cases in federal courts and it is unfair to them and unfair to common sense where identical offenses can be committed one by a native american
