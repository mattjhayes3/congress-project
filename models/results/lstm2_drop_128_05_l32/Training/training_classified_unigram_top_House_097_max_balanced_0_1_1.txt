nations deteriorating transportation network just as people cannot function with veins and arteries which do not work properly so our nations economy cannot function properly with vital arteries of commerce that are worn out the condition of our nations infrastructure has reached crisis proportions our interstate highway system is deteriorating at a rate requiring reconstruction of 2 000 miles per year although it has yet to reach completion and secondary roads off the interstates are often in much worse condition more than 100 000 of our nations bridges are officially listed as dangerous and 45 percent of them are either obsolete or structurally deficient in my home state of colorado needed bridge repairs alone will cost 200 million we simply have no alternative but to begin a major effort to rebuild in the long term this is a costeffective effort estimates are that it costs five times more to rebuild a bridge once it has fallen than to repair it before it does yet the past 15 years have been marked by massive underinvestment in public facilities since 1965 the percent of gross national product devoted to our infrastructure needs has dropped from 3 6 percent to 1 7 percent in 1980 we simply must correct this deficiency we cannot expect our economy to achieve sustained growth if our public transportation network is in a shambles the special task force on longterm

contained in the bill the formulas contained in h r 6211 represent a dramatic change in funding which is very detrimental to the interest of not only western states but of other states which share our geographic and demographic transportation profile according to the colorado highway commission the formula changes would shift the balance away from the number of lane miles of state highway and toward vehicle miles traveled or its surrogate fuel consumption the primary formula in this bill would change the present careful balance which takes into consideration such things as area rural delivery mileage and intercity mail route mileage to one based simply on rural and urban population this change alone would lead to a decrease of 8 6 inillion annually and my states highway commission estimates that the combined effect of these changes could cost colorado over 21 million in expected revenues for next year additionally the changes in the interstate 4r program comes on top of a change made last year that already has cost the western states millions of dollars the formula change in h r 6211 represents the final step in a shift in the program away from the fair treatment of the western states with their extensive roads and few people and toward the exclusive interests of states with large populations and small geographic areas in short it removes the funding balance which is critical to a national program of this type i certainly hope that the floor managers of this bill in the other body follow through on their stated intention to oppose in conference any

alerting the reagan administration and indeed the nation to the seriousness of the problems this unfortunate decision has created i might say that i did everything in my power to block the original sale of the f15s to saudi arabia in 1978 i am just as determined to prevent this further enhancement of saudi arabias military capability indeed i have already introduced a resolution house concurrent resolution 90 to block this sale and i urge my colleagues to support it i have also written a letter to president reagan expressing my opposition to the sale in the strongest terms unfortunately the reagan administration now appears to be compounding its original error this past week we heard reports that the administration has tentatively decided to provide still more arms for the saudis in the form of five advanced awac surveillance planes i regard these proposals as a most dangerous foreign policy mistake on the part of president reagan and his foreign policy advisers it disturbs me deeply that they do not seem to recognize the consequences of their action in fact the state departments official justification for providing the saudis with this added weapons capability is that there is a serious deteroriation in security conditions in the middle eastpersian gulf area i ask the state department how creating a greater security imbalance in the area can help prevent deterioration in security conditions there is no question in my mind that adding to the saudis weapons capability does create a security imbalance already we here reports that israelunderstandablyis seeking additional f15s and intelligence equipment from the united states to counter the additional weapons threat from the saudis if saudi arabia gets this equipment its f15s will be able to hit any target in israel from any base in saudi arabia no wonder israel feels the need to add to its defenses why should not israel feel threatened nor would israel be alone egypt iraq and iran also are capable of coming under saudi arabian attack with this new equipment you can be certain they will all be seeking additional arms to meet this new menance in selling this military equipment to the saudis the united states is stimulating a new arms race in this most volatile part of the world that certainly contributes to a further deterioration in security mr speaker there are two other important problems involved in this proposed sale first there is no doubt in my mind that the world will regard this as another attempt to appease one of the opec oil producers saudi arabia one of the leading oil producers of the world has recently been threatening to reduce production in order to force oil prices still higher it is a tragic error to believe that welling arms to the saudis would appease their appetite for higher oil prices three years ago we were assured the sale of the f15s would persuade the saudis to moderate their oil price policies in those 3 years under saudi arabias leadership opec has more than doubled the price of crude oil causing untold world financial problems such are the rewards of appeasement second and perhaps even more im portant is the fact that if this sale is permitted it will break a most solemn commitment made by the unitedstates government in 1978 to the unitedstates congress and to israel we were assured that if the f15s were sold to the saudis no additional offensive equipment for the planes would be permitted to go to saudi arabia now the reagan administration wants to break this solemn commitment i find that deplorable and a foreign policy error of the worst kind we are united here on the floor of the house in sending a strong protest to the president i hope he will reconsider his unfortunate move but it appears at this time that it will be necessary for the congress to take action to prohibit the sale of these additional weapons i noted earlier in my remarks that i had introduced a resolution to prevent this sale in the

committee i want to publicly express my appreciation to him for all of his outstanding cooperation on behalf of this legislation it is nearly beyond belief that this one man george washington performed so many crucial roles in founding this great nation as commander in chief he led our troops in the fight for independence as statesman he presided over the constitutional convention as the first president he organized the new government he did all of this out of a sense of duty and love for his country even though it worked great personal and finantal hardship upon him this bill would authorize the minting of up to 10 million 90 percent silver half dollars in his honor the coins would be sold to the public in 1982 and 1983 at a price equal to the cost of their manufacture and distribution plus a 20percent surcharge that surcharge would be used solely to repay the national debt this bill honors washington not only by its issuance of this coin but also because it is fiscally responsible as military commander and later as president washington faced and surmounted severe budgetary and financial problems he knew the necessity for fiscally sound programs by requiring that money from the sale of these coins be used to reduce the national debt these coins will follow washingtons example of fiscal responsibility while the purpose of this legislation is indeed to honor the father of our country who was a hero of the revolutionary war there is another aspect of the legislation that is also important i am today declaring war on the national debt because it has reached a point where interest on the national debt is rapidly approaching 10 percent of our annual budget in the 10 years from 1970 to 1980 the national debt has increased 139 percent and from 1975 to 1980 the debt increased by 68 percent in pocketbook talk that means that in the last 10 years american taxpayers have handed out more than 293 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt while i realize that the 10 to 15 million that will be realize from the sale of the washington silver half dollars is a small amount compared to the size of the national debt it is nevertheless a beginning there are substantial and immediate savings that can be made by reducing the national debt for example 90 million will be saved for every 1 billion reduction of the national debt and for every 10 billion that it is reduced there will be a 900 million savings these figures assumed an annual average interest rate of 9 percent and with interest rates currently on the rise a debt reduction could result in even a more substantial savings from now on every time there is a bill brought before this house that will result in income directly to the united states i will offer an amendment to require that such income be used in reducing the national debt in the present congress we have heard much talk about reducing government spending but nothing about reducing the size of the national debt if we pursue both courses together we can bring inflation under control in a far quicker manner for too long the national debt has been like the weathereverybody talks about it but nobody does anything about it we cannot change the weather but we certainly can change the size of the national debt and that is going to be my no 1 priority from now on the following chart indicates exactly how the national debt is the tail that wags our economic dog i am not going to stand here today and recite all of the figures in the chart but i would suggest that there is enough material in this chart to

will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe the bipartisan recovery budget is going to be adopted"], [0.9721210934221745, 0.027878906577825546, 1, "reserving the right to object i do so for

what has happened over the last 8 years it almost seems as if the only time the foreign policy establishment wants to be bothered with this problem is when they are prodded by the congress they have therefore sought to allay congressional concerns by a combination of false assurances and a stream of excuses i hope we have learned from this process and will no longer unquestionally believe such assurances and recognize that it is always possible to invent new excuses when one is not truly committed to an action i think it would be useful to review what has happened in the last 8 years in 1974 turkey occupied 40 percent of cyprus using weapons which had been furnished by the united states the congress decided that the use of american weapons in such a fashion violated american law governing the use of such weapons and imposed an arms embargo on turkey two administrations felt that the law was inconvenient and in essence asked us to ignore the law throughout that period the turkish government remained intransigent the carter administration used that very intransigence to convince the congress to lift the embargo in 1974 they arued that as long as turkey felt offended we could not reasonably expect them to make concessions furthermore they gave assurances that there would be progress if the embargo were to be lifted many members of congress voted to lift the embargo out of the best of motives they genuinely de sired an acceptable solution to the problem if lifting the embargo would help they were willing to take that step the assurances proved to be ephermeral however the congress did add a requirement that progress toward a solution be certified every 60 days the administration dutifully complied and found progress had been made during each reporting period it was an exercise in illusion both sides knew that there was no meaningful progress the administration then discovered that political instability within turkey precluded any progress despite the termination of the embargo they pointed out that neither prime minister demirel nor prime minister ecevit could command a parliamentary majority if they tried to make concessions and the administration counseled patience as we all know the parliamentary impasse was abruptly ended and the now government can no longer use the lack of a parliamentary majority as an excuse despite this we still have not seen a realistic proposal the present administration has put cyprus on the back burner there have been many other international problems which have demanded immediate attention but i do not think that the situation on cyprus should be ignored this resolution expresses the sense of the congress that benign neglect cannot solve the problem the animosity can only grow and make a solution problematic how many children live with the daytoday knowledge that they have no real home because somebody on the other side continues to occupy their homes what can we expect when this generation matures i do not think that they will be moderate the resolution emphasizes that the president should give a higher priority to gaining a solution the passage of time can only make the problem more difficult finally i think there is a moral imperative for the passage of this resolution we cannot condone even implicitly the occupation of a sovereign nation by the troops of another country we have a responsibility to speak out against such a tragedy that responsibility is not diminished by the fact that the offending country is an ally it is hypocritical to establish a double standards under which we condemn the actions to totalitarian regimes but condone or excuse the same actions if they are taken by friends i would point out that the government of cyprus does not constitute even the remotest threat to turkey and there is no good reason for the continuation of the occupation we have a responsibility to keep the issue of cyprus before the consciences of the world we must emphasize that de facto partition of the island will never be an acceptable solution ii14211 i strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution"], [0.0006254911422729492,

that i once again propose an amendment to the constitution of the united states to insure that due process and equal protection are afforded to an individual with respect to the right to life more than 1 300 000 babies are aborted every year those abortions contradict an integral tenet of our societythe principle that each and every individual has the most basic of all rights the right to life it is the responsibility of the state to protect that right our responsibility has been recognized by many of my distinguished colleagues in recent congresses i am pleased to say that liberals and conservatives alike as well as individuals on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly shown support for the godgiven right for each individual to life hopefully in the coming years more of our colleagues will join our ranks so that we will soon see that right guaranteed in the form of a constitutional amendment it is appalling that we find ourselves in a society where abortion is commonplace and where physicians and intellectuals condone the taking of certain lives it is time that we confront this issue headon and move to protect those lives which could conceivably contribute to the betterment of our world as you know on january 22 1973 the supreme court in the wade and bolton decisions made a mockery of the right to life i along with millions of other americans was greatly distressed when the court rules that abortions in certain stages of fetal development were legal it is already clear that the supreme court decision of january 22 has led to excesses and abuses never intended or envisioned by proponents and supporters of the decision supreme court justice white astutely foresaw this development in his disagreement with the supreme court arbitrary decision on the value of life which makes the worth of a potential human being dependent upon being wanted by his or her mother in his dissenting opinion justice white argued at the heart of this controversy are those recurring pregnancies that pose no danger whatsoever to the life or health of the mother but are nevertheless unwanted for any one or more of a variety of reasonsconvenience family planning economic dislike of children the embarrassment of illegitimacy etc the fact is human life irrespective of age health function or condition of dependency guaranteed under our constitution must be preserved and protected the unborn have long been held to have legal rights under the law they have property rights they may inherit property family names and in some societies family titles the rights to property have long been affirmed by the courts of this country as such they deserve to be safeguarded just as an adult is protected under existing laws governing homicide there is of course the difficult moral question which arises when the mothers life is seriously endangered by the continuation of pregnancy in this case it is clear that abortion may be permissible this adheres to selfdefense principles long established within our body of laws we must remember however that abortion statutes are written to protect the unborn childnot to serve the whims of one or both parents social planners or popular faddists furthermore the responsibility of saving the child should be equal to the responsibility of saving the mother in those cases where abortion is necessary the right to life especially for the unborn must be reaffirmed and protected in that spirit i offer the following resolution to restore this most basic human right and to insure that this right is recognized and safeguarded under the constitution of the united states"], [0.0006592869758605957, 0.5006592869758606, 1, "if the gentleman would yield further i would like in further support
