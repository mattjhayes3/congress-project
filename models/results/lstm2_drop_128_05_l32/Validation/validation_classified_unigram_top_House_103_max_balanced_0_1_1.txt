gag rule permitting just on republican substitute but no separate votes on three critical areas i am therefore urging members to defeat the previous question so that i can offer an amendment to the rule that makes in order just three additional amendments subject to 1hour of debate each first the michelsnowe amendment to strike the btu middle class energy tax and replace it with real spending cuts second an archer amendment to strike the tax increase on seniors social security benefits and third a stenholm substitute amendment for title xvi to provide entitlement caps with a real hammer enforcement mechanism that is all my amendment would do as much as we would like to make in order all of the amendment presented to the rules committee i think it is far better that we keep this previous question vote as simple as possible so that there is no mistake what your vote means to quote from this mornings wall street journal editorial the point is that members shouldnt be able to claim they opposed parts of the tax bill but were helpless to amend it a vote for the closed rule is a vote for the largest tax increase in american history if you told the average constituent in my district that this week we are voting on a reconciliation bill you would probably draw a blank look that is insidethebeltway budgetary jargon but if you tell that same constituent that we are considering the presidents tax billthe largest tax increase in historythere would be a look of instant recognition shock and outrage when the president first unveiled his tax program i thought the president might just get away with the socalled btu tax because it was beyond the comprehension of most of the btu might as well have stood for beyond taxpayer understanding but the public didnt take long to catch on to the btu tax in my district the people know it is going to hit them in the pocketbook at every turnfrom the gas station to the supermarket to state and local taxes to the home today btu is well understood to stand for bleed taxpayers unconscious it is a middle class tax increase plain and simple the same goes for the presidents senior citizen tax increase try as the president may to depict this as a tax on upper income individuals the senlors in my district who make 25 000 a year as individuals or 532 000 a year as couples hardly consider themselves wealthy its another tax on middle clas taxpayers only in this case on those who are retired on fixed incomes the purpose of a reconciliation bill is supposedly to bring our actual spending decisions into line with what we can affordto reconcile our appetites with our incomes the problem is as everyone knows that the government has a voracious appetite that can never be satisfied and so instead of curbing our appetite to match our income we are being asked to increase that income to feed that government appetite for more and more spending and more and more government programs unfortunately the government is not a selfsupporting creature that has any incomeproducing earning capacity it must therefore depend on the incomes of others to satisfy its insatiable appetites and the others it must depend on most heavily are the great mass of middle income workers who are barely getting by now on what they earn yet they are being told by the president that they must sacrifice more for the good of their government it is hard to believe that this is the same president who a few short months ago promised middle class taxpayers a tax out not a tax increase you may recall this little campaign book put out by governor clinton and senator gors entitled putting people first how we can all change america on page 15 of that book there is a paragraph entitled middle class tax fairness in which coauthors clinton and gore promised and i quote we will lower the tax burden on middleclass americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share and it goes on middleclass taxpayers will have a choice between a childrens tax credit or a significant reduction in their income tax rate in the interests of truth in political advertising and labeling i think the president and vice president should publish a revised edition of their campaign book that reconciles their campaign promises with the reality of their record this book should be entitled putting taxes first how we will shortchange america that is just what is happening in this socalled reconciliation bill instead of getting a tax break middle class americans are getting shortchanged well that is not the kind of change my constituents voted for they did not send us here to raise their taxes they sent us here to cut government spending and that is why it is so important for us to change this unfair gag rule and make in order amendments that will do just thattake out the taxes on the middle class and replace them with deeper spending cuts they want us to be able to offer amendments to strike the middleclass energy tax and the middleclass seniors tax and replace them with spending cuts and yet the democrat majority leadership through its wholly owned subsidiary the rules committee has said no to the american people and to these amendments once again they have shut the people out of their own house for the sake of cramming the presidents tax increases down the throats of middleclass taxpayers the time has come for this house to do the right thing and say no to this antidemocratic and antimiddle class rule i urge my colleagues to vote down the previous question so that we can offer a substitute rule that will allow for separate votes to strike the middleclass energy tax and the senior citizens tax and substitute spending cuts for them vote down the previous question and for a rule that will allow us to offer responsible alternatives that will take the tax burden off the backs of the middle class and put the deficit reduction burden back on the congress by mandating spending cuts that is what the american people want us to do this is one of the most critical and important votes you will cast in this session make no mistake about it the people will not be fooled by any attempt to paint this as a procedural vote this is your vote on whether to tax or not to tax to cut spending or not to cut spending vote no on the previous question and for our substitute rule and failing that vote no on

well who just spoke the gentleman from idaho for his idea it is obviously a way to save money and give better health care that is what we are about in the congress this year i am pleased to take this time to talk about health care reform there is no more important issue confronting this congress in fact in the next few days the members of this house members of the senate will probably have the opportunity to vote on the most important bill that they will vote upon during course of their career a bill which will have a substantial positive impact on the quality of life in this country we in the congress have been talking about health care reform for some 4 or 5 years now as a matter of fact as the president pointed out president nixon himself back in the early 1970s proposed a very substantial health care reform bill much along the lines of the bills that we will consider on the floor prior to that two decades before president truman said that we needed to give health care assurance to all americans notwithstanding that timeframe in which we have considered health care reform families in america those who work hard for a living and are having a tough time making ends meet and businessmen and women who are seeing a larger and larger part of their payroll going to cover insurance premiums and taxpayers across the country who feel an evergrowing bite taken out of their tax dollars for federal state and local health care costs they too have been talking about the problems with health care systems for years even before we started intensively reviewing this subject some 4 or 5 years ago i today we take the floor to talk about solutions talk about what the american people sent us here to do take action to solve real problems confronting real americans not rich americans not poor americans but every american and particularly the hardworking middle class that makes this country what it is they go to work every day they perform services for their employers for their neighbors for their communities which make a difference they as we have pointed out play by the rules and they need to be assured that they and their families will have health care that will always be there the solution offered by house democrats is the result of the input of literally hundreds of thousands of americans who over the past 5 years have met with members of both sides of the aisle talking to them about their concerns their problems and the problems confronting their families democrat representatives have held thousands of town meetings and republican members have as well to get a grasp of the problem their constituents face every day and to learn their priorities for a comprehensive solution as caucus chairman i have presided over nearly 40 meetings of the house democrats on health care over the last 5 years to compare our notes and work together towards a real solution one that builds on the current system a comprehensive solution that works the package house democrats presented last week is that solution first it builds as i said on the current system most americans who work for a living are not sure and more than 8 out of 10 of the uninsured either work or have someone who works in their family eighty percent of the uninsured a workrelated context they or their family members but they cannot afford insurance and their employers do not provide insurance and their families are at risk this reform will extend health security to each and every one of the 250 million americans that sent each of us in this house here who gaid to us go to washington dont just talk dont point fingers at one another dont carp dont play partisan politics with my familys wellbeing they said go to washington put your heads together and as my kids used to tell me be real do something for us that will make a difference for the security of our families this reform of which the majority leader will speak in just a few seconds this reform guarantees not as an afterthought but as a fundamental principle the same or better choice of doctor and hospital than we in this house have today this reform cuts the rapid growth in health costs through competition so that health insurance remains within the reach of average working families average working families average working families they are not average at all and as we say the common man is indeed a very uncommon person who has made this country what it is butwho is now concerned that the hard work he or she has extended on behalf of themselves and their families can be lost overnight with an illness that can devastate their family the majority leader will perhaps speak tonight of the family crisis that he confronted when his son was stricken with cancer i have a daughter she is now 23 years of age two and half years ago she was diagnosed with a heart problem she had an extra electrical conduit in her heart and it made her heart beat too fast it was life threatening she had an operation at johns hopkins university one of the great health care centers in this country and they took out that extra electrical charge during the course of that operation which took 5 hours they went inside her heart they never had to cut her open with high technology two catheters up her legs and one through her shoulder blade they first found that extra electrical charge and then they burned it out she is fine today her mother and i did notcare what that procedure cost it was irrelevant thankfully we were covered by health care insurance thankfully she is 100percent healthy today because of that high technology expensive though it was life changing life saving and giving to our family and to that young womans assurance of health this reform guarantees as the majority leader will pointout a minimum benefits package so that americans like all of us get the care they need and the costs are borne fairly by all the american family that is the concept we share and the concept of insurance of course is that we share well not all who are at risk have a loss or healthcarecrisiscausing expense but we surely know that some of us will and we need a system to ensure that all of us will be covered in that event this reform achieves our goals without new government bureaucracies as the majority leader is going to point out without new broadbased taxes democrats feel that we spend enough on health care already we have to spend it smarter however for most americans those with steady jobs and good health coverage there will be little change in how we get coverage what will change is that the cost of our premiums will not rise as fast and as far what will change is the choice of coverage options will be retained or expanded and the choice will be ours to make each and every one of us each and every one of us will have choice not simply the choice of the employer but the employee as well what will change is that when we go to bed at night we need not worry that a childs cough is our first step toward financial ruin because we will be covered covered even if that cough develops into a serious illness even if one loses their job or changes their job when members of the house of representatives first started to focus on the problems that our constituents were having with health care several years ago the gentleman from missouri was already working towards solutions indeed since his first days here in the house in the 1970s he has been a leader on health care reform engaged in making sure that average americans were not forgotten by the system those years of hard work culminated in the crafting of a comprehensive solution to those problems one that will not only address the specific problems of average americans but one that will control the evergrowing numbers of tax dollars that go to pay for health care through medicaid and medicare both at the federal level and at the state level because just like at the family table when we sit down to plan the federal budget each year an ever growing percentage of the pie is going to pay for health care that is money that is not going to critical education programs that is money that is not going into student loans more police to build better roads or to repair our bridges at this time i yield to the majority leader no one in this house has been more responsible for making sure that the house of representatives addressed this critical problem for americans i want to congratulate the gentleman for his work and yield for a more expansive explanation of the program that resulted as he will point out from the work of major committees of this house and literally every member of this house has had input into the creation of this plan"], [0.992714662104845, 0.007285337895154953, 1, "i

final chapter in the story of the cleanup but the prologue to the next crisis since enactment of firrea in 1989 strong and solvent thrifts have frontloaded a great deal of cash that has been required to resolve failed institutions they have taken this money from a diversion of all premiums since 1989 additional surcharges on the insurance premiums transfer of the 3 billion surpluses of the industryowned federal home loan bank system and an additional 300 million in mandatory annual contributions from the system through 2029 further until 2019 saif institutions must shoulder an 800 million annual obligation to fund fico bond indebtedness had saif received saif member premiums since 1989 it now would have over 6 billion instead of the approximately 800 million with which it will begin operation firrea anticipated such a problem and authorized the appropriation of money to cover postrtc losses as well as help recapitalize the fund on a sound basis firrea recognized that healthy surviving institutions simply could not afford to pay for the sins of the past while simultaneously handling new problems building up the fund to a prudent level and raising the industrys own net worth to firreamandated levels overwhelming these institutions with the crushing financial burden of such high insurance premiums would not just be unfair but counterproductive perpetuating the s l crisis and leading to additional failures unfortunately this bill turns its back on a realistic and sensible course charted for saif in firrea the bill establishes what strikes me as an impenetrable roadblock to timely use of any saif loss funds the bill states that the 1989 federal commitment to appropriated funds can only be used if the industry is in such bad shape that raising premiums would cause failures in other words the bill tells the financial regulatory agencies to raise the industrys premiums to the point where it will almost but not quite drive institutions into insolvency only then can these appropriated funds be spent until such time as the fdic can make the requisite deathbed certification to cove losses once its own very limited resources are depleted saif will have to borrow funds from the federal deposit insurance improvement act of 199ts line of credit this requirement will force thrift insurance premiums to a point higher than what banks pay banks currently pay an average of 24 basis points for insurance while thrifts pay an average of 25 basis points this premium differential will widen even more dramatically in 1998 when banks are expected to recapitalize the bank insurance fund after 1998 banks premiums could fall to 8 or 10 basis points according to most analysts from a competitive standpoint a large and enduring premium differential would be a

constitutional amendment i am pleased to insert the following excerpt from a book entitled the constitution of 1787 a commentary written by george anastaplo professor of law loyola university of chicago and published by the johns hopkins university press pages 186187 the two long passages are from james l kilpatricks chicago suntimes column of april 3 1986 i have also suggested that it is difficult to believe that any balanced~budget amendment however it should be proposed and ratified would have its intended effect all of the proposals that have been taken seriously include prudent provisions allowing congress by threefifths or some other supermajority to override any balancedbudget restriction even more serious this general approach assumes that there exists a thing readily identifiable as a budget and that it is reasonably evident when it is balanced or when expenditures are matched by receipts is not the balancedbudgetamendment approach naive depending much more upon incantations than is politically sound such approaches can be little more than rhetorical exercises which can have the bad effects not only of cluttering up the constitution but also of misleading people as to what a cbnstitution can and cannot do the best popular critique i have seen of a balancedbudget amendment is by a conservative columnist who had this to say about the matter the senate last week fell just one vote short of approving a constitutional amendment intended to compel a balanced federal budget it would be pleasant to say good riddance to bad rubbish but we have not heard the last of this folly this was the proposed amendment outlays of the united states for any fiscal year shall not exceed receipts to the united states for that year unless threefifths of the whole number of both houses of congress shall provide for a specific excess of outlays over receipts a second section would permit congress to waive these restrictions in wartime a third section would make the amendment effective in the second fiscal year after its ratification he best speech in the senate against the proposed amendment made four points 1 the resolution lacks constitutional feel 2 from a parliamentary standpoint it is plainly grotesque 3 its terms could easily be evaded 4 it is unenforceable by any acceptable means the amendment said would wage war on the c6nstitutions majestic simplicity indeed it would constitutional amendments ought to address either the rights of the people or the structure of government the column ends with observations that apply to much more than the current controversy a balanced federal budget ought not to be constitutionally mandated whether by an amendment t at originates in congress or by an amendment that originates in a constitutional convention it is a bad idea in either event the way to get a balanced budget is to elect responsible men and women to congress it is a humiliating confession of irresponsibility that this amendment should ever have been considered if a balancedbudget amendment should work we might then resort to an amendment absolutely forbidding crime in the streets and still another insuring that only the most virtuous should serve in public offlce we could adapt to this latter amendment the provision in the 1776 maryland constitution that a person of wisdom experience and virtue shall be chosen governor on

i though was important was that the eda university centers are now required to be evaluated once every 2 years to make sure that indeed they are working the loan program has been eliminated that the gentleman complained about there have been other things made as well to try and bring that greater accountability to the eda i would urge members to reject this the gentleman from new york eloquently spoke about the regional director in philadelphia mr corrigan who i also find to be the finest in the eda tradition i inight point out that he was brought to washington under republican administrations to assist there was a high degree of professionalism maintained through various administrations and indeed one of the best eda administrators that i ran into was bonnie newman appointed under the reagan administration who disagreed with the program but said it is my job to run it and to run it effectively the eda has continued to assist those communities on a bipartisan or better said nonpartisan basis i would just urge members to reject this amendment and to do so overwhelmingly in fact i think it is a statement to the strength of the eda the bipartisan debate we have heard in favor of retaining the eda i would urge that because every one of us has a situation that we can recount about the eda how many of my colleagues have had to deal with natural disasters and unfortunately we can never tell when we are going to have to deal with a natural disaster in florida in california in hawaii in my own state of west virginia in 1985 how many of my colleagues are

would suggest that the authority that has been granted to use such other sums is absolutely essential so that if a natural disaster occurs or an emergency occurs there does not have to be a hesitancy when the gentleman talks about additional appropriations those are appropriations those are not authorizations we are asking for the authority here for authorization for appropriated money when it is made to be exercised or spent in a certain fashion so we no longer have the committee on appropriations of the house controlling areas like the economic development administration but in fact we have had the good foresight to authorize what we want to do and direct that being done i would call my colleagues attention to an example however to show just how distinctly different this years authorization is from past authorizations if we look at 1980 some 15 years ago the eda was actually funded at a level of 513 million today that amount of funding in accordance with the value of the dollar would be 1 049 000 000 and in reality we are only authorizing 386 million so we are some 65 percent lower than what the actual funding would be if we had stayed at 1980 spending levels i do not think we can be any more frugal or responsible economically than that and i would suggest rather than deluding ourselves that the important principle on the gentlemans amendment as to why it should not be adopted is what we are trying to doto get responsibility in this house which is in fact to authorize and have those authorities followed by the executive branch so we can get control over the expenditures of the government so i urge my colleagues to vote down the gentlemans amendment in its present form"], [0.001068204641342163, 0.49893179535865784, 0, "i yid myself such lime as i may

peoplels republic of china this 4 in my view our only appropriate response to the dangerous and repressive ollcles of that government lpoicies which have continued unabated aal the wh4le china has been accumniating an everincreasing trade surplus against our country for those members who are concerned about jobs in america theyua batter be listening to this debate nothing of particular significance has changed in china since 1990 when this howe first went on record by an overwhelming majority favoring a termination of mfn for china it should be clear to any objective obs r that all these years of mfn status have not led to any substantive ckanges in the behavior of the chinese regime the reasons for denying mfn to china cam be summarized in four categories hiamm rights vractices trade policy military polcy and foreign poiabout human eights little needs to bes aid china remains a loolice state and it remains one of the most serious human rights violators in the world mr 8 peaker particularly offensive is ckinas use of forced labor which includes the involvement of as many an i million prisoners in the manufacture of export goods the american peodle are by far the largest recipients of slave labor goods coming from china and putting maericans out of work of course there s the ongoing oppression and cultural genocide against the people of tibet a people whose only crime is the desire to be excluded from the regimentation imposed on society by the chinese communists as for trade policy the latest figures show that china is running up et another huge trade surplus against our own american exports in 1992 alone the united states trade deficit with china reached a level of 11 2 billion a rise of nearly 50 percert over the previous year during the first quarter of this year our trade deficit with china rose by yet another 25 percent over the same period from last year our turade deficit with china has tripled since the ienanmen square massacre and it stands today second only to the trade deicit wth japan the h4 8 jdy 22 1993 deficit with japan is 50 billion china 18 billion and growing to 22 billion this year alone can there be any wonder why the chinese regime does not take our gov ernments protests about human rights and trde pollcies serlously can any mernber here honestly say that china is more economically competitive than amerlca or is the denial of a racess to the chinese people for american goods the real problem wh1 know it is i believe every member knows the answer to that quesbon worse yet china is using this trade surplus to finance a massive military buildup a buildup which has been accelerating since the chinese regime used the military against the chinese people back in 1989 in that brutal massacre while we and every other civilized matlon around this world are reducing our defense spending china is increasing theirs this year alone military spending in china is increasing by 15 percent and it is financed by the trade surpluses that we are allowing to happen we are allowing this massive military buildup this military buildup is across the board it includes upgrades in both nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabillties believe me we americans should be as worried about these developments as chinas neighbors are and they are scared to death the fourth and final rejson why china does not deserve mfn is its foreign policy this is a regime which has sold m11 missiles to pakistan just xecently given nuclear technology to iran and algeria and refused to support the united nations sanctlons against north korea the one regime with a worse track record than beijing unless of course we include the khmer rouge in cambodia for whom china continues to be the principal patron in conclusion i would like to conment on the presidents executive order i address these comments especially to my friends on the other side of the aisle whom i have great respert for particularly the gentlewoman from caifornla the presidents order does not go far enough to produce any significant resuits we will be right back here again next year consequently this order is not likely to have any effect at all on changing the attitudes of those angry old men in the great hall of the people that is precisely why the joint resolution i am offering today is so important this house has gone on record for 3 consecutive years as favoring a termination of chlnas mfn if we do not do so again this year we will have sent a message of confusion and weakness to the chinese government and we will have negated any possibility that the presidents order may get zome results this joint resolution should be seen as a reinforcement for the presidents order it adds leverage to the presidents approach by letting the chinese regime know that congress remains willing to revoke mfn if beijing does not modorate its behavior become civilized america is always most effective abroad when it is united at home and speaks with mone voice that is what we ought to be doing here today one last thing we have a bill coming to the floor soon it provides 3 billion to help americans who have been ravaged by the midwest floods that is deficit financing we have problems in cleveland and in new york and in los angeles and in chicago and all over this country if we revoke mfn today it simply raises the tariffs on imported goods coming from chinese slave labor by anywhere from 8 percent to 40 percent they will still be way below the cost of american goods do the members know what these tariffs will do however here is a letter from the congressional budget office these tariffs will bring in 615 million that is 615 million in new revenues to either help lower the deficit or help pay for programs that our
