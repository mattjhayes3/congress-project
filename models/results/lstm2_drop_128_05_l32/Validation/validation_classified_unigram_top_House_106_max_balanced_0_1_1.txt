of your budget resolution for this supplemental shows that your spending levels are a sham a few days ago you were calling for draconian spending cuts now you are asking for dramatic increases 12 5

is nothing less it in no way changes substantive law at the state or federal level the bill is necessary not only to prevent illegal shipments to minors but to enable states to police licensing standards track sales and collect taxes on those sales last year illegal alcohol shipments cost states some 600 million in lost revenues state taxes on alcohol are an important source of support for state programs and protecting that funding stream is a legitimate state objective some who are opposed to this legislation argue that it would impede the development of electronic commerce by taxing the internet or chilling direct sales of wine and spirits over the internet well whatever the merits of chilled wine are there is no merit whatsoever to these arguments as my friend the gentleman from

prohibition in effect they were the instrument by which an illegal enterprise bootlegging was turned into a lawful and regulated activity some will argue that now these laws are an anachronism well

near cracow in poland in fact the holy father just celebrated his 80th birthday this past thursday may 18th during which he celebrated mass ate lobster with senior clergy in the vatican and sang songs with polish compatriots as a teenager during the second world war karol wojtyla experienced firsthand the horrors of nazism the holocaust and soon thereafter communist totalitarianism i have carried with me the history culture experience and language of poland said the pope once having lived in a country that had to fight for its existence in the face of the aggressions of its neighbors i have understood what exploitation is i put myself immediately on the side of the poor the disinherited the oppressed the marginalized and the defenseless said the pope after considering a career as an actor and even petitioning three times to become a catholic monk he was persuaded by the thenarchbishop of cracowwho recognized his charisma oratorical talents and potential to help people directlyto pursue the priesthood he was ordained as a catholic priest in 1946 became archbishop of cracow in 1958 cardinal in 1967 and was elected pope by the vaticans college of cardinals in 1978 at the age of 58the first nonitalian pope since the holy pontiff by his own description is a moral leader who believes in the sanctity of the human being over the years he has denounced the excesses and affronts to human dignity of the two major competing social systems of the 20th century communism and capitalism he has condemned the atheistic and dehumanizing forces of communism which he experienced in poland and he has denounced the more unsavory aspects of modem capitalism such as greed abject poverty selfishness and secular atheism according to his spokesman the holy pontiffs goal is to establish a mode of christian thinking to serve as a meaningful alternative to the humanist philosophies of the 20th century such as marxism and postmodernism his moral philosophy and its impact on world affairs eamed him the honor of time magazine man of the year of 1994 which described him as the most tireless moral voice of a secular age pope john paul iis moral philosophy has brought much needed attention to the plight of the worlds poor in this vein the pope has called for substantial reduction or outright cancellation of the international debt that seriously threatens the future of many of the poorest nations inspired in part by the popes example we are proud to have contributed to the enactment of international debt relief legislation last year which was facilitated by the jubilee 2000 movementthrough which the holy father has nurtured meaningful ecumenical cooperation pope john paul ii has already left us a substantial body of written work that will nourish future generations with the wisdom and benevolence of this moral philosophy in fact his writings fill nearly 150 volumes through his encyclicals homilies letters and other writings this pope of letters has inspired the world to embrace universal principles of human dignity and human rights in 1994 his popular volume of philosophical and moral ruminations crossing the threshold of hope became an immediate bestseller in 12 countries the most traveled pope in history pope john paul ii has brought his message of peace and reconciliation to 117 countries in his most recent visit to israel for example the holy father prayed at the western wall one of judaisms holiest sites his prayer an unprecedented act of contrition on behalf of catholic christians read as follows we are deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the covenant and how can we forget his groundbreaking trip to cuba in 1998 on that papal visit he condemned the dehumanizing and immoral aspects of both cuban communism and the outdatedand senselessunitedstates trade embargo as customary his words echoed in the farthest corners of the world pope john paul ii understands one of the most fundamental christian principles that has become a hallmark for fostering reconciliation forgiveness in one of the most remarkable acts of forgiveness ever witnessed publicly the holy father confronted the man that attempted to assassinate him and forgave him for his grave sin the holy fathers acts of compassion stem from his inherently benevolent nature his compassion charisma and moral authority are celebrated by leaders of other faiths for instance the dalai lama the spiritual leader of the worlds buddhists has said of the pope he really has a will and a determination to help humanity through spirituality that is marvelous that is good i know how difficult it is for leaders

we have before us would encourage entities to fix year 2000 problems now and would also provide a method for weeding out any future frivolous lawsuits while providing an outlet for legitimate claims i also think that it would be foolish to establish an unwarranted precedent to limit damage awards in product liability cases yet another example of how we are changing jurisprudence i think it is important to discourage frivolous lawsuits that may come as a result of the year 2000 glitch but this body should not pass overbroad legislation that will hurt both businesses and consumers who have

first our plan gives citizens the right to choose the right of choice seniors will have a choice of at least two plans every senior has different health care needs and that is why they may need different health care plans to choose from what is more our plan is completely voluntary so if a senior likes the coverage they already have they can stick with it rather than enforcing government price controls which some would argue in this body our plan uses group buying power to reduce the costs of prescription drugs by as much as 25 to 39 percent millions of these seniors have benefited from these expanded choices and cheaper prices by banding together in private organizations like aarp they get all the benefits of washingtonmandated price controls but without rules and regulations

gentleman from indiana mr visclosky the ranking member of the subcommittee for their exceptional work in bringing this bill to the floor this member recognizes that extremely tight budgetary constraints made the job of the subcommittee much more difficult this year therefore the subcommittee is to be commended for its diligence in creating such a fiscally responsible bill in light of these budgetary pressures this member would like to express his appreciation to the subcommittee and formally recognize that the energy and water development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 includes funding for several water projects that are of great importance to nebraska this member greatly appreciates the 12 million funding level provided for the fourstate missouri river mitigation project the funding is needed to restore fish and wildlife habitat lost due to the federally sponsored channelization and stabilization projects of the picksloan era the islands wetlands and flat floodplains needed to support the wildlife and waterfowl that once lived along the river are gone an estimated 475 000 acres of habitat in iowa nebraska missouri and kansas have been lost todays fishery resources are estimated to be only onefifth of those which existed in predevelopment days in 1986 the congress authorized over 50 million to fund the missouri river mitigation project to restore fish and wildlife habitat lost due to the construction of structures to implement the picksloan plan in addition this bill provides additional funding for floodrelated projects of tremendous importance to residents of nebraskas 1st congressional district flooding in 1993 temporarily closed interstate 80 and seriously threatened the lincoln municipal water system which is located along the platte river near ashland ne therefore this member is extremely pleased the committee agreed to continue funding for the lower platte river and tributaries flood control study this study should help formulate and develop feasible solutions which will alleviate future flood problems along the lower platte river and tributaries this member is also particularly pleased that this bill includes 220 000 for the planning engineering and design phase of the sand creek watershed project in saunders county ne additionally the bill provides 275 000 for the ongoing flood control project for antelope creek which runs through the heart of nebraskas capital city lincoln the funding is to be used for preconstruction engineering and design work the purpose of the project is to implement solutions to multifaceted problems involving the flood control and drainage problems in antelope creek as well as existing transportation and safety problems all within the context of broad land use issues this member continues to have a strong interest in the project since he was responsible for stimulating the city of lincoln the lower platte south natural resources district and the university of nebraskalincoln to work jointly and cooperatively with the army corps of engineers to identify an effective flood control system for downtown lincoln antelope creek which was originally a small meandering stream became a straightened urban drainage channel as the city of lincoln grew and urbanized resulting erosion has deepened and widened the channel and created an unstable situation a tenfoot by twentyfoot height and width closed underground conduit that was constructed between 1911 and 1916 now requires significant maintenance and major rehabilitation the current situation represents a dangerous flood threat to adjacent public and private facilities the goals of the project are to construct a flood overflow conveyance channel which would narrow the flood plain from up to seven blocks wide to the 150foot wide channel the project will include trails and bridges and improve bikeway and pedestrian systems finally this member is also pleased that the bill provides funding for the missouri national recreational river project this project addresses a serious problem by protecting the river banks from the extraordinary and excessive erosion rates caused by the sporadic and varying releases from the gavins point dam these erosion rates are a result of previous work on the river by the federal govemment again this member commends the distinguished gentleman from california the chairman of the energy and water development appropriations subcommittee and the distinguished gentleman from indiana the ranking member of the subcommittee for their support of projects which are important to nebraska and the 1st congressional district as well as to the people living in the missouri river basin to chairman packard who is retiring from congress at the end of
