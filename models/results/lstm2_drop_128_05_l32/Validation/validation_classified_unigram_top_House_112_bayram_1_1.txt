direct the vet center as a team leader the first african american to achieve this position in the western united states by 1984 lee was increasingly aware of the cultural and communication barriers

cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves locked up in oil shale now 1 2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil that is comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 petroleumproducing countries of the world combinedjust in one segment of three rocky mountain states yet we are not producing it commercially in part to a very significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on federally owned public land we need to change that we need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and gas production generally we need to improve the permitting process for offshore development in the gulf of mexico and in other areas we need to allow the states to regulate hydraulic fracturing without the fear of suffocating and duplicative federal regulations we need to keep all the federal lands in the west open to all kinds of energy development and of course we need the president to approve the keystone xl pipeline this will contribute substantially to americas energy

act of 2011 this bill would create a federal information network that would make it easier to track down and prosecute those who seriously injure or kill state and federal law enforcement officers in 2011 a total of 72 law enforcement officers were killed by perpetrators 10 of which were in my home state of california for the first time in 14 years there were more officers killed by gunfire than officers killed in traffic accidents gun violence against law enforcement had declined in recent decades however there was a 70 percent increase from 2008 to 2011 the cause for this increase is unknown but with technology growing better each day and methods becoming more sophisticated these statistics should be going in the opposite direction some officers attribute the rise in deaths to budget cuts and officers not having the necessary resources to ensure their own safety others believe that the new trend of sending officers to the most violent areas of the city as a preventative measure has led to the spike regardless this is a problem that needs an immediate solution due to this dramatic increase in only a few short years the fbi conducted a study which showed many of the officers were killed while attempting to arrest or subdue a suspect who already had a history of violent crimes with this information they implemented a new federal program so that now when an officer pulls over a car and runs the license plate they will be informed if the suspect has a violent criminal record so they can be properly prepared while this new program is a step in the right direction law enforcement officers will always be put in high risk situations it is simply the nature of the job they put their lives on the line everyday to protect the citizens of this country and they deserve to know their government is doing everything it can to provide them with as much safety as possible the national blue alert act of 2011 would ease the minds of officers reassuring them of a quick and efficient response should anything happen to them while on duty the bill would also increase the likelihood of catching a perpetrator who injures or kills an officer every stop an officer makes can be potentially fatal yet these men and women go to work every day because they know their service will save the lives of countless others with this level of self sacrifice the very least we can do as elected officials is provide them with the reassurances within the national blue alert act today i ask my colleagues to rise up in support of the national blue alert act of 2011 a quick

the maryland community both on and off the court and field both of them are good friends of mine gary williams was my neighbor for a number of years gary retired as marylands basketball coach after 22 hardworking successful college years in college park and 33 years in college coaching ranks at his retirement gary williams ranked as the fifth winningest college basketball coach in america with 668 wins stretching over his remarkable career he is also the third winningest coach in atlantic coast conference history behind two legends dean smith and mike krzyzewski gary williams inherited a struggling program and turned it into a perennial national contender under his guidance the terrapins reached the ncaa tournament 14 times 11 times consecutively won three acc regular season titles and an acc tournament championship made seven sweet sixteens two elite eights two final fours and in a memory that all terrapins still treasure and i had the opportunity of attending in atlanta won the national championship in 2002 coach williams was honored as national coach of the year in 2002 and as acc coach of the year in 2002 and 2010 but numbers alone do not capture his impact on the lives of his players or on the life of the maryland community where he stood out as a leader and as a philanthropist marylands athletic director kevin anderson correctly summed it up best when he said gary williams is a legend that is true terrapins will also miss our football coach ralph friedgen who coached his last game with the program on december 29 fittingly it was a decisive wina 5120 victory in the military bowl in washington dc the fridge as he is affectionately known also took over a struggling program and led it to notable success he guided maryland to the acc championship in his very first year as coach and of the 10 years in his tenure 7 of them ended with postseason appearances in both his first year as maryland football coach and his last he was named acc coach of the year coach friedgen won 74 games for the university of maryland brought new energy to our football program and left a lasting mark in college park he was respected by his players and looked to as a role model i was proud to call him a friend as well he too will be missed by all who love maryland who love football who love basketball and who live the principles that sports teaches both gary

instruct before and it calls on the conferees of which im a member to act and to do so by february 17 i believe is the date thats been suggested we would like to act in fact we await an alternative from the senate the conference committee has met and led by our very capable chairman dave camp of michigan weve held i believe three or four open joint housesenate republicandemocrat conference discussions meetings which hadnt happened around here certainly in the last congress i dont think it ever happened and were doing it in the broad daylight and weve had four of those and our staffs are having some discussions but youve got to go back and understand that the house under republican leadership actually passed a 1year extension of the unemployment benefits the house republican led passed a 2year doc fix which meant for seniors who are on medicare that the physicians they rely so much on for their health care those physicians would continue to be able to afford to see them and not face a 27 4 percent cut in the reimbursement rates now heres the deal we passed that and we funded it and we did it for 2 years not 2 months2 years we did the payroll tax as its called by my friends on the other side of the aisle payroll tax middle class tax workingamerican tax cut for a full year now theres a debate about whether that should be offset or not because our party has said you know when we reduce the tax burden on hardworking middle class americans families and job creators we shouldnt have to go raise somebody elses taxes to do that now the difference on this if were talking about social security taxes this is about reducing the amount of money that you and i you and i pay into social security and every working american that pays into social security were saying you get to reduce how much you pay into social security by this 2 percent now those of us on this side of the aisle believe that the social security trust fund has been raided once too many times by both parties over time but that should stop and so if were going to reduce how much goes into social security we should offset that somehow so that the fund is not drained and that can be done in a multitude of ways but it should be done because otherwise its less money going into the social security trust fund and i think wed all have to admit as the actuaries do that at the end of the day the social security trust fund is not the best funded trust fund on the planet and we are going to need to do some work to secure the retirement of future generations in social security so back to the point here the house passed all of that we did a 1year payroll tax reduction so that hardworking middle class americans would have tax relief theyd have that extra money in the pocket and lord knows they need it especially when you see whats happened under this president with energy costs i think gasoline was 1 86 a gallon when president obama took office and we now go to the pump and its somewhere between 3something or 4 and pushing over 4 depending on where you are in america youve got to have a little extra money just to try and keep up and take your kids to soccer and go to school and go to work its hard out there so we passed that a year extension of that and a full year extension of unemployment for those who have struggled in this horrible economy there have been 11 recessions since world war ii this is the worst in terms of a recovery from a recession when ronald reagan was president we had a horrible recession in the early eighties we came out of that recession and if it were at the same pace now as then youd create something like 15 million 16 million new jobs which means virtually everybody whos unemployed and still uncounted because a lot of people who have fallen off the unemployment rolls arent counted all of them would have jobs if we were growing at the same pace we did when president reagan was in office and we came out of that recession but were not the policies really havent worked the socalled stimulus that the american taxpayers were told if it would just pass somehow unemployment would never get above 8 percent now a trillionplus dollars later with interest payments that the next generation will get to pay back were somehow supposed to celebrate unemployment thats dropped to 8 3 im glad to see the improvement im glad to see the job gains in the private sector for goodness sakes my wife and i have been small business owners since 1986 in oregon i understand what its like to sign the front of a payroll check and the back and to grow a business and to deal in good times and in bad but the long and short of this is this is a horrible recession so coming out of this we need that bridge we put some reforms in unemployment to help people to lift them up to give them incentive when theyre out there for a year year and a half 2 years that maybe we could help them get a better education encourage that allow states to encourage that to help them get a ged because all of the data shows that if you have a high school diploma if you have a ged the odds of you getting hired are much higher then we gave the states the opportunity to do drug screening ive heard from a lot of employers in my district out in rural oregon that say we do drug tests and congressman youd be shocked at how many people apply for the job and cant pass the drug test well if you cant pass the drug test then maybe you really arent actively seeking work in a way thats legitimate because you cant get hired and yet youre on unemployment so why dont we do some sort of screen figure out that problem that you have and help you then get treatment so we said to states were going to do away with a federal decision thats i dont know 20 30 40 years old that said states dont have this authority i think states could actually manage this pretty well that was in the bill the house passed so we did all of these things a 1year reduction in the taxes people pay into social security the payroll tax deduction a 2year fix for your physicians who treat our families on medicare both of my parents theyre gone now they were on medicare my wifes parents whove also passed away they were on medicare this is an incredibly valuable program but we passed a 2year fix for them the 1year for unemployment and the 1year for the middle class tax cut all of that went over to the senate and this is probably something maybe we can agree on here what we got back from the other chamber was a 2month extension of those things now some of us stayed around here when the house said really a 2month when this is a 1year and 2year problem why dont you appoint some negotiators so the speaker of the house mr boehner appointed the negotiators through the house side we hoped that the senate would appoint negotiators they didnt they didnt appoint anybody in fact they left town eventually when nobody showed up after wed been here for a week trying to see if we couldnt bring both sides the house and the senate together republicans and democrats work out something more than a 2month deal they wouldnt show and we ended up passing a 2month extension which by the way puts us right back where we are right now which is why we have this motion to instruct from my friends on the other side of the aisle calling on the conference committee to get its work done by the 17th so we have worked for that in fact the last time this was voted on here it was overwhelming i think there were only 16 no votes in the house so we want to get this done too now the republican conferees have met today as weve done over the last week or two the democrat senate conferees by the way they had a retreat today down at the nationals ballpark in some meeting room there was a planning retreat both parties have had these in the house but it just sort of caused a pause in the effort because the democrats were all off at a policy retreat today from the senate so we werent able to accomplish much today but we hope to get something from the senate because you see they go into the conference and they had this 2month effort against our 1year so we cant negotiate against ourselves so were waiting for a proposal back from the senate which we hope to get soon if we do tomorrow well meet at 10 oclock republicans democrats house and senate to try and work this through we want to get this done the american people deserve to have us get this done were working on a way to do that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.004417508840560913, 0.4955824911594391, 1, "i rise in

placed this issue on its high risk list unneeded and underutilized buildings are languishing in the federal inventory when their sale could generate muchneeded revenue for the national treasury maintenance of these buildings costs the government nearly 1 7 billion in fiscal year 2010 alone in tough times like those we face today this waste is simply unacceptable in this congress four separate pieces of legislation have been introduced to help solve the problem h r 665 combines the best elements of these legislative proposals and creates a timely and workable method of disposing of excess federal property while generating the highest possible financial returns the bill would establish a fiveyear pilot program to dispose of the 15 highest value unneeded federal real properties the federal government will clearly gain from the disposal of these properties not only will the fair market value generate income but we will realize significant savings by eliminating maintenance and operating costs i also support h r 665 because it will provide aid to organizations dedicated to helping those most vulnerable among us the homeless this legislation permits congress to appropriate the equivalent of two 2 percent of the proceeds from the sale of these properties to fund grants to eligible organizations that serve the homeless this requirement preserves our commitment to the goals of the mckinney vento homeless assistance act this bill will also expand transparency surrounding the disposal of federal property it requires that gsa report annually to congress on the number market value and deferred maintenance costs of all executive branch real property assets the report would also include ongoing operating costs of surplus properties so that we are always aware of the expenses that empty unused properties are incurring the public will also be able to access information on all real federal property through a database required to be established by gsa agencies will also be allowed to retain the net proceeds from the disposition of real property and use those funds to maintain repair and dispose of their other properties net proceeds not used for such costs would be used for deficit reduction this provision will incentivize agencies to move properties quickly through the disposal process and will keep revenues moving into the treasury i am pleased that
