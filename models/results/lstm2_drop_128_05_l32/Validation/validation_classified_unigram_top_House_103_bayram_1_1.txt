recent years congress has had to reexamine funding for federal jurors specifically in 1989 congress was forced to pass a supplemental appropriation which included a provision adding money to the fund

a reduction of 21 million from the fiscal year 1994 amount and 18 million less than the presidents budget request the s6 692 million increase provided for by this amendment will help to ensure that

equality during the 1960s these groups attempted to reach these goals by removing the legal struclure that supported racial discrimination and segregation and by developing the unanimously accepted view that overt acts of racism are not morally tolerable in american society even after these monumental achievemerits africanamericans did not gain social and economic equality today the goals of achieving social and econoric equality remain the same only the scope has been expanded africanamerican organizations now unite to address critical social conditions such as drug abuse crime poverty

is too little known that 60 years ago communist dictator joseph stalin deliberately employed the ruthless policies of forced collectivization and grain seizures to suppress and politically neutralize the ukrainian people more than 7 million people were cruelly starved to death because of these repressive measures just 1 month ago the people of newly independent ukraine officially commemorated this tragedy as a nation for the very first time thousands of ukrainians gathered in kiev ukraine for 4 days of somber events marking the 60th anniversary of what historians have named the harvest of sorrow elderly famine survivors traveled to kiev and shared horrific firsthand accounts of suffering they spoke of eating bark and weeds to survive of the desolation of entire villages and of red army soldiers going doortodoor among the peasantry confiscating food and livestock survivors testified that the harvests in the early 1930s were good and while innocents starved in the streets soviet soldiers guarded full storehouses of grain the official observances that were held in kiev are significant because stalin and his closest associates concealed the artificially created famine for decades the mass starvation of millions graphically illustrates ukraines history of suffering under soviet subjugation l~ublic recognition of the famine including passage of house concurrent resolution 140 is vitally important to the new nation of ukraine ukrainian president kravchuk declared september 12 a national day of mourning and stressed that a free and democratic society will safeguard the ukrainian people from future collective victimization in the aftermath of the collapse of the soviet empire the world is learning more and more about the harsh reality of life under a totalitarian regime this resolution on the ukraine famine serves as a reminder that the alternative to a democratic and free market society is unacceptable and it presents congress with an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to helping ukraine and the other former soviet states as they proceed along the tumultuous path toward democracy and a free market economy house concurrent resolution 140 also supports action that will aid in disseminating information about the artificially created ukraine famine following the official observances in kiev members of the commission on the ukraine famine which congress established in 1984 to study and expand the worlds knowledge of the famine presented their findings to the government of ukraine the commission presented 4 volumes of its conclusions 10

reconciliation plan and his economic plan for growth and reducing the deficit and also for her very magnificent presentation and very clear presentation of the new direction that this deficit reduction plan will take our country i thank her very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in her special order tonight i am very pleased that the presidents plan as amended by the house and senate conferees turns out to be a very profamily plan it does this by its investments that it makes in people that helps at the very same time to reduce the deficit to give our people work not welfare and to give them hope not despair how does it do this well it is profamily in many respects one is its childrens initiatives that are contained in this package childhood immunization the family preservation and support act the mickey leland hunger relief act and the earned income tax credit in addition to the enterprise zones which will help create jobs in some of the areas of our country which need them the most i would just like to take a few minutes to elaborate on some of these points and then move on to some of the economic arguments that spring from these i believe that while these are profamily and they are investments in people they will help get this country moving as well as reduce the deficit as far as the immunization initiative is concerned president clinton said on our nation is the only industrialized nation in the entire world that does not guarantee childhood vaccination for all children it ought to be like clean water and clear air it ought to be part of the fabric of our life so spoke our president and he said that in the context of only 55 percent of our nations 2yearolds fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases in 1991 because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country with 55 000 victims 166 people were killed in the epidemic and 11 000 americans were hospitalized this could have been prevented next in the package i want to commend our president and conferees for putting funds in for family preservation 1 billion child abuse and neglect is an escalating national crisis of devastating proportions nearly 3 million children were reported physically sexually or emotionally abused or neglected last year 3 million children in our country and at least 3 children a day die from abuse most before their first birthday that is hard to imagine while tie number of children reported abused in fact more than doubled between 1981 and 1991 federal funding has been cut in half i am very pleased that the president and conferees included as i mentioned 51 billion in this package next the mickey leland childhood hunger relief act is a very important domestic antihunger initiative the most important introduced in the last 16 years i am very pleased that the president has and well we would like more money always but i think at this moment it is 2 5 billion for the mickey leland hunger relief act it would allow families in addition to the funds it also will allow families to deduct high shelter costs in the same way that elderly and disabled households do so at present this is very very important for our families who exceed 50 percent of their income for shelter it would also encourage payment and collection of child support and assist working families and children then in that package i conclude my focus there on the earned income tax credit this proposal substantially raises the level of credit for working families with children to lift working families out of poverty and provide the modest credit to very poor workers without children to help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open for all you would expect i say to my colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut that i would be supportive of a program that contained these initiatives being on the progressive side of the spectrum in this body and i am pleased that they are in the package again i think they not only help people they help reduce the deficit but i do want to turn now to some business voices which favor the package let me say first that the american people according to the wall street journal last week they reported that americans are expressing more support for president clintons economic plan as it nears its crucial final vote by a comfortable margin of 54 to 32 percent people say that the clinton plan would represent a step in the right direction and the survey indicates that many americans are sour on the conduct of mr clintons republican critics the american people support this plan i now want to address some of the business leaders last week 58 business leaders many of them republicans from across the country endorsed president clintons economic plan i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues and our listeners the comments of some of those business leaders chairman august busch of anheuserbusch said we applaud the fundamental fairness of your initial plan as well as the diligence with which you have worked to keep equity a cornerstone of the final product jerry pearlman chairman of zenith electronics said i strongly support your 500 billion deficit reduction plan and the selective spending cute and appropriate investments i have no doubt that your plan will meet the major challenge of reducing the deficit while stimulating economic growth job creation and investment further to this xerox ceo paul allaire said successful passage of the budget reconciliation bill is a critical step in restoring longterm economic growth and job creation the presidents economic program is a balanced approach that shifts national policy away from deficit spending and toward jobcreating investment the chairman of time warner gerald levin said this legislation is our only opportunity to move forward on the economic front to fail at this moment would have grave consequences for americans and american business around the globe i am proud to join you in encouraging swift and positive congressional action the ceo of tenneco mike walsh said the united states cannot continue to live on borrowed time and borrowed money we elected a new president because we wanted change now it is time to act not blink or quit the president is taking on one of the most critical issues we face as a country and it is time for us to stand up support him and start attacking the deficit and then finally the president of h r block harry buckley said the majority of h r blocks clients are middle and lowerincome taxpayers many of whom would benefit from the presidents plan to expand and simplify the eitc and distribute the tax burden more fairly throughout all income brackets the new york times said in its editorial last month antitax rhetoric poses a threat to the common sense when the american congressional conferees meet this week to begin the arduous task of reconciling the house and senate budget bill we want common sense to prevail over political rhetoric we want this house to pass this budget very strongly you i say to my colleague presented very convincing arguments and compelling evidence of why this plan will work and why it must be done i think that it is clear that from left to right from people to business it is clearly viewed that we must reduce the deficit we must create jobs we

have taken out this time this evening to talk about the north american freetrade agreement we know that it is a package that is being strongly supported by president clinton it is being supported by all of the living former presidents this morning a letter was circulated from all 10 living former secretaries of commerce supporting the north american freetrade agreement for a very simple and basic reasons they have all come to the conclusion that the north american freetrade agreement is in the best interest of the united states of america one of the things that has happened over the past several weeks and months is that the people have been led to believe that implementing the north american freetrade agreement is somehow a sellout of unitedstates interests actually nothing could be further from the truth in fact the opposite is the case when one looks at nafta i happen to believe that as we look at the challenge of the future nafta is in our best interest in fact as we listen to people who regularly stand here on the floor of the congress we listen to people out there in the country debating on television and radio programs the north american freetrade agreement we regularly hear horror stories about mexico about the flow of united states jobs from the united states of mexico 0 1930 we hear about problems that exist on the border we hear about the problem of illegal immigration which certainly affects my state of california our taxpayers in my state have to shoulder a 3 billion annual cost for illegal immigration we hear about the wave situation that exists in mexico we hear about human rights violations in mexico we hear about a lack of political pluralism in mexico we hear all these things and one would conclude that every one of these problems is taking place why because of nafta well nafta does not exist nafta is an agreement which will be struck among the three countries canada the united states and mexico and is proposed to go into effect january 1 1994 and be phased in over a 15year period so as we listen to the horror stories of united states jobs going to mexico as we listen to the horror stories of environmental problems on the border as we listen to the horror stories of human rights violations which have taken place in mexico as we listen to all these problems illegal immigration and all we have to realize that all these things have happened not because of nafta because there is no nafta i happen to believe that while every single one of these problems does exist the best way for us to counter these is by implementing nafta so basically the conclusion that i have drawn is that the north american freetrade agreement is about the future and not the past what we need to do is realize that we have some very serious economic problems right here in the united states i am privileged to be able to represent part of los angeles county here the unemployment rate in los angeles county is between 9 and 10 percent the unemployment rate statewide in california is right around 9 percent i happen to believe that the north american freetrade agreement is not just in the best interests of the state which i am privileged to represent here in the congress it is in the best interests of this country why because we desperately want to create job opportunities here in the united states all over the country the best way for us to do that is to realize that finding new markets for unitedstates manufactured goods and services is the best way to do that how do we do that by breaking down tariff barriers and that is what nafta is all about you know those who oppose the north american freetrade agreement do not offer a jobcreation strategy oh yes they say things with which i agree that we should reduce the capital gains tax rate here in the united states to create a business friendly government outlook here but we have this great opportunity 3 weeks from tomorrow when on november 17 we cast our vote on the north american freetrade agreement frankly if we pass this opportunityand there are many who have predicted defeat of the north american freetrade agreement i think we have a great chance to narrowly wth it i have said many times that if this were a secret ballot it would probably win by 75 votes why because as i have talked to colleagues on both sides of the aisle democrats and republicans they say they know it is in the best interest of the united states u america to pass nafta but they feel political pressure at home and for other reasons they do not think they can vote for it in fact more than a few have said to me they hope it passes but they feel they do not want to vote in support of it so clearly we have to look at the consequences of a potential defeat of nafta let me tell you basically what happens there is no doubt whatsoever that someone will export products like cars computers medical equipment telecommunications to mexico with nafta if we put it into place it will be the united states of america we will be the ones manufacturing automobiles telecommunications medical equipment computers other things to send into mexico without nafta it will just as likely be japan and the european community i have said many times that i am not one who likes to engage in bashing japan or the european community but i am the first to acknowledge that japan and the european community have benefited greatly since we played a role in rebuilding their economies their societies in the postwar world and what has happened is they would very much like to have the chance to get into the mexican economy there are 88 million consumers in mexico and if we defeat nafta they will have in mexico little choice other than to look towards japan the pacific rim and the european community for opportunities to trade why because the united states will have said to the neighbor their neighbor with which they share a 2 000mile border to the north the united states will have said forget it we dont want to do this now i have always said that as my friends talk about not this nafta we want to create a north american freetrade agreement i believe that is slightly disingenuous why because while this is a 2 000page agreement and i do not like every aspect of it and i am supporting nafta in spite of not because of the side agreements i am convinced they do not jeopardize unitedstates sovereignty as some have said but as we look at this package that is phased in over a 15year period and the reason it is so long is that the tariff structure is so great today that we need to work to bring it downbut as we look at those who say not this nafta we need to negotiate another nafta i say strike an agreement that will have the support of ross perot and pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown lyndon larouche ralph nader these people who came out and opposed nafta said there should be another nafta the aflcio i am hardpressed to believe that an agreement could be struck that would have all of the support of the aflcio and pat buchanan and at the same time jesse jackson so the fact of the matter is while it is not perfect and i realize i am the first to admit there is going to be some job displacementthat is what happens with free markets the free flow of goods and services that is the way it works i am convinced while this one is not perfect it clearly is far superior to the status quo and it does create an opportunity for the united states of america to have a tremendous tremendous advantage over the japanese and the european community let me explain why first of all we look at the tariff structure that exists today i would like to ask you to focus on these charts right here so that our colleagues most of whom are not here but i realize they may be seeing this in some other spot the tariff structure that exists today as a tariff that ranges between 10 and 20 percent for chemicals united statesmanufactured chemicals going into mexico where the united states tariff on chemicals from mexico is between zero and 4 percent under nafta for the united states and canada that tariff will be completely eliminated what we will see is we will see this tariff barrier of 10 to 20 percent maintained not for the united states but for the japanese and the european community look at pharmaceuticals on an average a 15percent mexican tariff is charged on united statesmanufactured goods going into mexico the average tariff that we impose on mexican pharmaceuticals coming into the united states is only 3 5 percent under nafta that is totally eliminated brought down to zero but for the japanese and the european communities it is still a 15percent average tariff barrier that wall will still be up giving the united states a greater advantage over our friends in japan and the european community in the textiles and apparels area 14 to 20 percent on average the mexican tariff that is charged a tax basically on united states textiles and apparel going into mexico6 percent is the average tariff that we have on mexican textiles and apparel coming into the united states this 14 to 20percent average tariff remains for japan and the european community but it comes down for the united states creating an opportunity for us to gain ancess to those 88 million consumers creating a chance for us to create jobs here in the united states and expand export opportunities for us so it seems to me we need to realize that nafta is clearly in the best interests of the united states let us go further industrial machinery on average a 10 to 17percent mexican tariff on united statesproduced industrial machinery going into mexico zero to 2 percent is the united states tariff on mexicanmanufactured industrial machinery coming into the united states what happens under nafta if nafta is implemented both sides are brought down to zero but remember japanese and european community manufacturers of industrial machinery will still face this 10to 17percent mexican tariff household appliances on average 17 1 percent is the mexican tariff on united statesmanufactured household appliances going into mexico less than 1 percent 0 8 percent is the average tariff charged on household appliances manufactured in mexico coming into the united states under nafta a total elimination of these barriers but 17 1 percent average tariff will be maintained for the japanese and the european community steelmill products on average 10 to 15percent mexican tariff on steelmill products coming from the united states into mexico 4 percent is our average tariff charged for mexicanmanufactured steelmill products coming into the united states under nafta totally eliminated but the 10 to 15percent mexican tariff will be maintained for the japanese producers and the european community flat glass the average tariff is 20 percjnt on flat glass coming from the united states into mexico the tariff that the united states charges on mexicanmanufactured flat glass coming in is threetenths of 1 percent this tariff brought down to zero totally eliminated except for the japanese and the european community that 20 percent tariff is maintained so the united states creates a tremendous advantage over the japanese and the european communties bearings 12 percent mexican tariff 7 percent the average united states tariff goes down to zero under nafta and what1 happens maintained at 12 percent for the japanese and the european community machine tools thirteen percent average mexican tariff that is charged on united statesmanufactured machine tools going into mexico 2 percent is the average unitedstates tariff on mexican machine tools coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade yet the 13 percent average is maintained for japan and the european community look at automobiles which is the item that is often discussed here and for the life of me as my friend the gentleman from florida chairman of the trade subcommittee says regularly he cannot understand why auto manufacturers and the workers would not support nafta why the tariff that mexico charges for united statesmanufactured automobiles a tax imposed on us to get our caft into mexico is 20 percent the united states tariff charged for manufacture of automobiles inmexico coming into the united states is only 2 2 percent under nafta it comes down to zero projections from the big three automakers are that we will see a 60 fold increase in the first year right now we export 1 000 automobiles from the united states into mexico under nafta the projections are that in the first year we will see an increase of 60 000 automobiles manufactured why because of the dramatic production that takes place and ultimately that tariff will be down to zero but m speaker the 20 percent tariff right here that mexico charges for automobiles coming in will be maintained for automobiles manufactured in japan for automobiles manufactured in germany for automobiles manufactured in italy or france or other countries but for the united states of america and canada under the north american freetrade agreement it will be zero so we will have a tremendous opportunity which is much greater than japan or germany to sell unitedstates manufactured automobiles to the 88 million consumers in mexico light trucks again 20 percent tariff that mexico charges right now for the united states to send light trucks into mexico our average again our tariff is 2 2 percent that we impose on mexican light trucks coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade dramatic increase in our opportunity to export from the united states into mexico but the 20 percent tariff is maintained for japan and the european community auto parts 13 1 percent tariff is what the mexicans charge for united statesmanufactured auto parts going into mexico fourtenths of 1 percent you can see here is what is charged for mexicanmanufactured auto parts coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero but for japan and the european community it remains at 13 1 percent for auto parts so with these figures you can see very clearly that there is a tremendous benefit that is accrued to the unitedstates worker which will enhance opportunities for us to have this grand strategy of creating jobs let us look at computers i have often pointed to this and said as i will say again this evening that computers is something that is of great concern in my state of california we have a 10percent figure here but actually the tariff on computers manufactured in the united states going into mexico goes up to 20 percent it is 10 to 20 percent and the united states tariff on mexicanmade computers coming into this country is between 3 7 and 3 9 percent as you can see on this chart well what happens is under nafta we bring that tariff down to zero a great big zero nada but the tariff of 10 to 20 percent remains for japan and the european community now the specific example that i have cited in the area of computers i would llke to share again as we talk to the people in the coinputer industry the chief executive officer of ibm the international business machines has said that if nafta is defeated ibm will have no choice other than to move operations to mexico why because it is the only way that they can gain access to those 88 million consumers in america but if we put the north american freetrade agreement in place we can keep the jobs right here in the united states why because under nafta the tariff will come down to zero so that united states workers can continue to manufacture computer systems products software and export into mexico tariff free under nafta so i would like to see ibm keep its jobs here in the united states and with a zero tariff export into mexico now if we pass nafta remember that 10 to 20 percent tariff on computers which will be eliminated under nafta if we pass it will be maintained for computers coming from japan and the far east other countries in the world the european community so what happens the north american freetrade agreement is a great boost for the united states of america the unitedstates worker and it will clearly create more job opportunities for us here computer chips 10 percent right now we have zero tariff no tariff on computer chips from mexico coming into the united states they charge us 10 percent that tariff that 10 percent tax on the unitedstates worker going in under nafta both will be eliminated you can see there is obviously a humongous difference that exists today we have no tariff and they have a 10 percent tariff it goes down to zero computer chips from the u~ited states will go in ibm tandy other operations will not have to shift from the united states and open up their manufacturing operations in mexico but and once again this 10 percent tariff that is there for computer chips is maintained for japan the european community and other countries throughout the world in the area of electronics 2 6 percent average tariff on electronics that they charge on our goods coming in 2 4 percent on mexicanmanufactured electronics equipment coming into the united states it will go down to zero that 2 6 percent average will be maintained for taiwan singapore hong kong korea and japan and other countries which would desperately like to have access to the mexican market they would love to get to mexico so that they could use it for a staging ground an export platform if you will to send goods into the united states but i believe that we in this hemisphere should unite together recognizing that the wave of the future is to reduce barriers now let us look at the export industry here in the united states we found that on average workers here in the united states who manufacture items for export earn 17 percent more than workers here in the united states the workers here in the united states are compensated for items that are simply for domestlc consumption here in the united states so it is a 17percent wage improvement for those people who are in the export industries we also know that contrary to the argument that we regularly hear that the poor mexican people cannot afford to buy united states goods the middle income wage earner in mexico there are 20 millionof them almost the entire population of canada and these are the people who are desperately seeking the opportunity to purchase united statesmanufactured goods and services so it seems to me that we need to do everything we possible can to expand these opportunities for us to create jobs right here in the united states now as we look i mentioned a few minutes ago the people who oppose the north american freetrade agreement it consists of i mentioned all the defeated presidential candidates ross perot pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown ralph nader lyndon larouche all these people have run for president of the united states and they strongly oppose the north american trade agreement let us look for a moment at the people who support the north american freetrade agreement last month actually on september 1 all 12 of the living american nobel laureate economists joined with 264 other economists in sending a letter to president clinton in that letter the likes of paul samuelson milton friedman and others robert solow and james tobin who have received the nobel laureate in economics strongly supported the north american freetrade agreement in their letter and i have got it here it says and i quote specifically the assertions that the north american freetrade agreement will spur an exodus of united states jobs to mexico are without basis and i think that the points that i have made with these charts point to that now i should explain that let me say that as we look at other support i remember when we went to the white house and president clinton had former president ford former president bush and former president carter join in a ceremony with him he stood up and he talked about his experiences as a governor he had told me on other occasions that as a governor he knew of people that under the present situation had seen their jobs go to mexico and he said that as a former governor he knows that every single person who lives in a governors mansion of the 50 in this country wakes up in the morning and the first thing he or she thinks of is how am i going to create jobs for the people in my state people expect their governors to create jobs for them in their states and that is really their top priority and 41 of the 50 governors in this country democrats and republicans support the north american freetrade agreement and i think that as those who are out there here in washington members of congress talking about how jobs are going to be lost one cannot help but ask the question why is it that 41 of 50 governors all of whom have as their top priority every morning when they wake up creating jobs for their states why is it that 41 of the 50 strongly support the north american freetrade agreement the reason is very simply that they know that nafta is going to create jobs in their states and i say to my colleagues if you look at the past several years exports for all but two states in the union have increased from between 100 and 300 percent already even with the tariff structure that exists and that is how we have been able to go from what was a nearly 6 billion trade deficit in 1986 to what we had last year a 5 4 billion trade surplus the mexican consumers were buying 5 4 billion more in goods from us than we from them now i know that opponents say that so many of these goods simply go down to mexico and then are manufactured and then turn around and come back to the united states but 83 percent of the items which go from the united states to mexico stay in mexico and they are there for the mexican consumer i mentioned the fact that all 10 of the living commerce secretaries who here at the federal level have as their responsibility economic growth creating jobs spurring on the economy all 10 living former commerce secretaries have today signed this letter which strongly supports nafta democrats and republicans so as we look at this issue it is clear that we need to do everything that we possibly can to expand these opportunities mexico is our third largest export market and it is the 13th largest economy on the face of the earth and it is one of the fastest growing and we need to realize that while we have had slow economic growth in many parts of the united states mexicos economy is growing and so are the economies of other countries in latin america the other countries in latin america desperately want to see us pass the north american freetrade agreement and i believe that if we try to stick our heads in the sand and simply say that the united states of america can stand alone that we will actually be hurting ourselves more than anyone can imagine there are some very dire predictions as to what might happen if we do not pass the north american freetrade agreement and the best one i believe is h 8504 c that which i was referring to with these charts we extend an invitation to japan and the european community to come to mexico and utilize mexico as an export platform to embark on freetrade agreements with other countries in south america they ultimately want to join with us and i think that as we look at the cause of freedom and the fact that during the past 15 years we have seen incredible advances in technology we have seen incredible advances in our ability to communicate worldwide the natural step is to work to reduce barriers to the free flow of goods and services i say regularly that i do not believe that i as a member of the unitedstates congress have a right to say to the people whom i represent in california you cant buy the best quality product at the lowest possible price i think that we should be able to do that i believe that we should do everything that we can to increase unitedstates productivity i am convinced that the american worker is by far the most productive it was united states productivity that led general motors and the united auto workers to make a decision to move a plant from mexico back to lansing mi creating a thousand jobs right here in the united states why because the united states auto worker is actually nine times more productive than the mexican auto worker so as we look at these issues which are of concern i hope very much that our colleagues will do everything that they possibly can to look at the details and the facts on this i recognize that it is a tough political issue out in southern california i suppose i enhance their efforts by saying this but there are more than a couple of people many of whom are not actually constituents of mine but know that i have been in strong support of reducing trade barriers trying to increase export opportunities for the united states but these people have gone out and picketed and protested almost daily in front of my office in los angeles and i certainly welcome them i mean i know that some of the people in my office may not welcome them but i support their first amendment rights their right to free speech they have a right to stand there and voice their opinions on this but i believe that as we look at the facts on this that it is in the best interests of the united states to look toward the future and not the past and that is what i am trying to do and i hope that 3 weeks from tomorrow on november 17 that a majority of our colleagues in the unitedstates house of representatives will join with a majority of our colleagues in the unitedstates senate and pass the

that we are trying to level out the united states with mexico and what the european community did i think we need to emphasize that more and more i think basically in the long term most of us believe that there has to be some kind of agreement along for the americas the point is what kind of an agreement and over what period of time the european community when they were bringing in greece spain

bring those three countries in at the end of each year those three countries had to reach a certain goal achieve a certain goal that had been set when they achieved that goal then they took the next

the many contentious issues contained within this legislation which we will debate today i think it is important to point out the important programs research and funding for which this legislation rovides indeed many of the programs funded under these departments are the daytoday lifeline programs so crucial to millions of americans foremost the lions share of funding contained in h r 2518 is designated spending for medicare and medicaid these are the dollars which support the federal share of the medicaid program and subsidize the medicare health services for our sick elderly while it is in fashion today to decry entitlement spending and slash medicare and medicaid spending for budget purposes we cannot lose sight of the essential purposes served by these programsfor beneficiaries this is often the only link they have to health care and medical services i do not mean to imply that these programs are unflawed nor that their growth need not be controlled but i stand firm in my commitment that health care policy and health care reform must be made on the issues of access and quality of health carenot a costbenefit exercise or balance sheet earlier this year i fiercely and vocally opposed the proposed cuts in medicare programs contained within reconciliation as i have long held we cannot try to tell our aging americans that all we have to do is ratchet down on waste fraud and abuse and cut the fees of those so called rich doctors and expensive hospitals and we will be able to cut costs and maintain quality health care that is just not so already the medicare program is losing its ability to attract and maintain the participation of quality providers furthermore it is painfully clear that shortfalls in medicare payments to hospitals and doctors will be costshifted and passed directly to every other insured american that means that over the next 2 years americans who have managed to hold on to health insurance will pick up 28 billion in medicare shortfalls to hospitals another 20 billion in underpayments to doctors and other providers will be costshifted to paying americans so as long as we as a nation do not turn the sick and injured away from our hospitalsso long as we are not leaving them to die in the streetsthe cost of caring for these patients will not go away only shifted to other insured patients this is exhibit a as to why we need to address the causes of our health care crisis not merely attach the symptoms todays legislatlon demonstrates our commitment to medicare and medicaid and funds more than 100 billion for these health care programs while we are not enacting changes in these statutes it is timely to once more remindmy colleagues that we cannot use these programs as sources for draconian budget cuts without question we need health care reform but not one which balances the budget on our most frail members of societythe sick elderly i am also pleased to see record levels of funding the national institutes of health including 2 1 billion for the national cancer institute these dollars will allow continued prevention research vaccine development treatment study and clinical experimentation toward eradicating this scourge the committee has reemphasized its support of ncis focus on breast cancer and prostate cancer research and rightly so more than 46 000 women die of breast cancer every year and one in eight women will suffer breast cancer in her lifetime this plague has hit especially hard in the northeast region of the united states and my own state of new jersey and i fully support efforts of nci to find the reasons and causesnd ultimately the curefor this terror at the same time more than 35 000 men will die of prostate cancer with more than 165 000 new cases diagnosed in 1993 i commend the recommendation of the committee that nci make prostate cancer another top priority in its research and mission the national institute of mental health also deserves recognition today i am confident nimh will make good use of the 613 million funded in fiscal year 1994 for its research and research training on mental disorders treatments and services and i laud the institutes efforts to educate federal local and state organizations as to the importance of mental health and the destigmatization of mental illness nimhs research continues to show us that mental illness is a real and physical one not some character flaw or personality demon that we cannot work to help or treat but a tangible physical health problem as real as diabetes cancer or a broken leg the work of nimh allows us so move past the dark ages of health care and move past the snake pit treatment of mental illness as congress addresses comprehensive health care reform i will be working to ensure that any reform plan provides equitable treatment for mental illness and party of health care insurance benefits and coverage for persons with mental illness nimhs pioneering research in this field has made clear what so many of us have known all along and sets the stage for future good work finally congress today is taking steps to make good on its promise in the ryan white care act to provide funding aids patients care intervention efforts and most notably emergency assistance to cities the committee has provided 318 million in emergency funding for especially hardhit cities and metropol tan areas and make no mistake my colipagues evry one of those dollars are especially needed the aids epidemic continues to grow and our public hospitals and health care resources are falling under this burden our emergency rooms in inner city hospitals are mash units today and the situation is worsening the lack of health services poverty and social dysfunction compounds this crisis as the cost of each aids patient reaches 100 000 over their lifetime the ryan white dollars cannot alleviate these problems or hope to pay every cost but our neglect can only further speed the collapse of our public health care system today aids is no longer a disease affecting the margins of societythe rate of increase of new cases shows us that every segment of society is touched by aids and every member of society bears those costs my colleagues these are but some of the worthy efforts contained in thi years appropriation i am certain that each line of this bill has its supporters and much more can be said as i indicated there are contentious and pressing issues to be debated but amid the highprofile questions lie the daytoday health and welfare needs of our american citizens they are the ones served by this bill and i urge my colleagues to support its passage"], [0.008846580982208252, 0.5088465809822083, 1, "i think that is an area of interest to a lot of members we heard earlier this evening about some of the staggering statistics that you outlined in terms of this country and diseases that should not exist in the most powerful nation on earth the wealthiest nation on earth and yet we see because we are not spending money on immunization we see this vast increase in these diseases so what we are doing in this progrma is guaranteeing to every american child the right to an immunization it is very simple these children cannot make that decision for themselves and at a national level we are saying it is so important to them as individuals that we are going to spend the money close to 2 billion to ensure that happens now there is some criticism for the fact that we are also paying for the very wealthy in this countrys children well let us examine that a little bit i think the argument is made because of the fact that if a person does have a health insurance plan that the health insurance plan does not include immunizations we will pay for it another approach therefore would be at a national level to mandate that every insurance company include as a mandate immunization for children what the health care people will tell you number one we hate mandates and they fight them in every state legislature they fight it in the halls of congress even a program as worthy as this and second if you do mandate it we will raise the cost to every policyholder in this country there is no free lunch with the health care industry believe me they have a very powerful lobby the other example the other reason given why we should not provide this to people is because there is a lot of working people that make 30 000 a year but they do have a health insurance program but it is not covered in the plan or they are working and they may not have health care coverage i think this is a very instructive statistic threefourths of the people in the united states who are not covered by a health care plan are people in a family where one of the people is working so these folks do not even have insurance coverage let alone insurance coverage that includes the immunization program coverage finally we talk about the superwealthy in this country i cannot imagine their not having a decent health care package that includes immunization programs but maybe they are selfinsured maybe they are and maybe we would be paying for those peoples children my thought about that is yes i guess we could set up a huge federal bureaucracy to means test the childrens parents to find out if they did hit that means level or not and hire lots of bureaucrats and set up all kinds of means testing regulations or we could just say look in this area children are the most important clients we are going to spend the money on the child regardless of how responsible or irresponsible that parent is what is the benefit to society besides helping the children in our society we know that it is going to save us health care dollars as a federal government so we are going to get this money back tenfold i am willing to bet because we have taken care of these diseases before they ever came into existence in a childs body"], [0.013507723808288574, 0.5135077238082886, 1, "not at this point in

this time to me first i would like to commend the chairman of the committee on rules for bringing forward a straight and very direct action that we need to take today we are not allowed in this chamber to talk about the other body so the comparisons that i have to reach for are in other countries there are other countries parliamentary institutions that tie themselves into knots because they do not have a rules committee and they do not have a rules chairman as we have in this house of representatives where we are able to decide that we are going to deal directly with one issue and if you are looking for credibility on this issue before the economic policies of supplyside economics were forced on this country we had a national debt under 1 trillion from george washington to the last day of jimmy carter this country amassed a debt of 800 billion following the supplyside economics the guidelines of gramm rudman the tax cuts of hance and others we have quadrupled the national debt but that is not what is the issue here today what the chairman of the committee on rules brings before us is simply accepting the costs of star wars of the b1 of the b2 and all the social and military spending that democrats and republicans voted for and the last 12 years of republican presidents have signed for you cannot go on a shopping spree and at the end of the day say we dont have the responsibility for this debt this congress democrats and republicans and 99 percent of it signed and voted for with bipartisan support in many instances but clearly threefourths of the debt signed by actions of a republican president is why we stand in this well today to address an increased debt limit so we can try to abandon our responsibilities but if we want to deal forthrightly with what we have to do as a congressand that is to accept the responsibility for the actions of the last 12 yearswe have got to move this debt ceiling up now from here we can take the presidents economic package his stimulus package and try to rebuild this economy so that we can stop having the kind of increases in debt and unemployment that we are suffering with today but today our actions are very simple to accept responsibility for what congress and republican presidents have done for the last 12 years one thing i would like to focus on for a moment there is going to be a choice there will be a straight upordown vote on accepting our responsibility or our republican colleagues will offer a motion to recommit which will try to complicate the issue but i think it is instructive for those folks of us here in the well and those at home to understand what that means for all the complaints about the democrats not giving the republicans ample opportunity to express themselves they have that in the motion to recommit in a democracy there comes a point in time at least in this chamber if not in other chambers of this democracy there comes a point in time where you have to vote where you cannot abandon responsibility our republican colleagues will offer an alternative which i think is a mistake and i hope this chamber rejects it flatly but they are not precluded from offering in their motion to recommit any kind of additions or changes in the chairmans proposal that is before us i would hope that the public understands for all the complaints about minority rights not being protected on

25th amendment to the unitedstates constitution regarding presidential succession in doing so i merely am reaffirming what i have done since the resolution is august of 1965 was passed by this house with about 28 dissenting votes mine was one of them i was the only one that gave the reasons why i voted no in the record and those reasons any interested member can find in that record of about i never dreamed that that amendment or that resolution would pass so overwhelmingly and then moreover adopted by threefourths of the states legislatures for i felt then as i feel now that it would be a damocles sword hanging over the head of our democratic institutions what is the 25th amendment how many of my colleagues here can tell me they know the exact thrust of the 25th amendment in that remark i made in specialorders after that session and that vote in august of 1965 i pointed out that for the first time in our history and since the constitution had been written the worst fears that the writers of the constitution had and the reason they had so much trouble in finally reaching the office of the presidency which they first called the chief magistrate was that they wanted to have a person that could not be imposed or selected but voted by the people and then the enabling statutes that were passed after the first congress in 1789 provided that it said that in the case of the neutralizing the death for whatever reason the vacation the vacating of the office of the president the vice president would be but if that president had had less than 11 2 years in office then an election would be called and the american people would vote so what happened since then the worst fears that i could ever imagine in 1965 have come to pass and not too long after that in 1974 with the resignation under the threat of impeachment of president nixon what was the role of henry kissinger and general haig they threatened to invoke the 25th amendment if president nixon did not resign under the imminent threat of being impeached why could they do that because section 4 of the 25th amendment says that if the majority of the governing body decide that the president is unable to discharge his duties they shall declare his inability and the president then shall vacate the office the vice president becomes acting president and a commission shall be formed thereafter consisting of three persons to be selected by the congress now the congress has never enacted enabling legislation saying the house and the senate will get together and the house will select one or two or all three or the senate one two or all three so we had our president resign and we had since then two unelected vice presidents and of course the unelected president that danger hovers and will constantly be hovering and therefore every congress since then i have introduced a repealer i hope eventually some serious consideration is given to restoring to the original intent the succession laws and the clause represented as the 25th amendment to the constitution i am reintroducing a resolution to repeal the 25th amendment to the unitedstates constitution regarding presidential succession in doing so i am reaffirming a conviction i have held since the amendment was first discussed in the house over 28 years ago and i believe as strongly today as ever that the 25th amendment is a threat to the stability of elected government in this country we value our constitution because it ensures that the government is elected and that the elected government is bound by laws but laws and constitutions are only as strong as the will of the people to keep and enforce them a government respects law only if its leadership is committed to law and we know that this is not always the case in the 25th amendment we have a device that is intended to provide for an orderly succession in the office of president proponents of the amendment had the best of intentions but to conceive and write the legislation that was going to truly carry out those intentions is something else the result is that we have a standing invitation in lawin the constitutionto overthrow the president through the operation of the disability clause of the 25th amendment there are no guarantees to life and there is no way of knowing whether the 25th amendment will become applicable during this or any other administration however presidential succession has been an issue in nearly every presidency since woodrow wilson starting with wilsons stroke and 2year disability while in office then roosevelts death eisenhowers heart attack kennedys death nixons resignation reagans near assassination and later cancer surgery and bushs illnesses and medication i have voted many times over the years in ways that clearly show i am in the minority on some issues and i was one of the very few dissenters in what tumed out to be the resolution calling for the 25th amendment i have introduced legislation in an attempt to repeal the 25th amendment ever since it was ratified in 1967 now who bothers with the 25th amendment and who was going to tell me when i took the floor in august 1965 and was the only one giving reasons for voting no to that resolution that i would see the worst fears confirmed in my lifetime i never dreamed of the extraordinary dangers inherent in that amendment what is the 25th amendment among other things it was passed because apparently it was felt that a great crisis had ensued after the death of president kennedy and the assumption of the presidency by vice president lyndon johnson because lyndon johnson did not have a vice president for a year as stated in the process of political succession edited by peter calvertst martins press new york 1987the orderly transition on the assassination of john f kennedy was not in fact as orderly as it was made to seem to the outside world but compared with the chaos that followed the attempted assassination of ronald reagan in 1981 and i might add what followed his cancer surgery in 1985 it was a model and of course what happened in betweenwith president nixon in 1974was just as chaotic if the 25th amendment was meant to eliminate chaos and provide for a smoother transition this has not been accomplished well what happened in 1974 we had chief of staff alexander haig and secretary of state henry kissingerboth positions which are filled by appointment not election by the peoplesaying president nixon if you do not resign we may have to invoke the 25th amendment these two unelected officials were going to use the disability clause of the 25th amendment to make a decision for the american peopleto force the president out of office later upon the attempted assassination of president reagan in 1981 alexander haig as secretary of state was again at the sceneclaiming to be in charge of the country when in fact there were three men ahead of him in the line of presidential succession such ambition and such ignorance of our constitution and the 1947 presidential succession act is precisely the danger inherent in the disability clause of the 25th amendment in 1985 president reagans cancer surgery caused another crisis in possible presidential succession the presidents reluctance to turn over the reins of power under the 25th amendment during his recuperation period may have caused one of the worst scandals in recent historythe irancontra affair in fact when president reagan went in for the actual surgery he did not want to set a precedent and bind the hands of his successors so although he wrote a letter that followed the format of the 25th amendment he did not call what he was doing an action under the 25th amendment and in fact said that he did not think the 25th amendment applied to his temporary sedation for surgery but what about his recuperationa person does not have major surgery and go back to work at full force as soon as the anesthesia wears off yet i have read that the presidents legal counsel fred fielding together with the chief of staff donald regan made the decision for the president to resume the office of the presidency immediately after his surgerynot the doctors not the cabinet but two unelected presidential advisers made the decision when asked about this mr fielding said that his and regans decision was based on the surgeon saying that the president was ok they reportedly accepted this on face value and did not question the physicians about the presidents judgment it was a terrible thing for the president to be brought back to office that soon a terrible thing for the country reports that president reagan made presidential decisions during his recovery from cancer surgery lends additional credence to the former national security adviser robert mcfarlanes contention that he received oral approval from reagan for the arms shipment to iran reagan underwent surgery on july 13the first arms shipment occurred the next month was the president reluctant to invoke the 25th amendment because of its disability provisionsbecause of the possibility that he could not regain power once he regained his health the 25th amendment certainly did not help prevent this tragic mistake in judgment and it possible caused it because of the fear that power once relinquished could not be regained as reported in the book papers on presidential disability and the twentyfifth amendment edited by kenneth w thompson jniversity press of america maryland 1988one of the drafters of the amendment former senator birch bayh has stated that there was concern about the possibility that a means for a coup detat was beir~g created by the language of the amendment he has said that this concern lead to the inclusion of the presidents cabinet in the decisionmaking of the presidents inability to discharge the duties of his office but the 25th amendment does not even mention the presidents cabinet instead it states whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as congress may by law provide determine that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president in fact in light of the fact that the amenament was drafted in response to the assassination of president kennedy it is significant that senator robert kennedy expressed grave concern about this provision of the amendment senator bayh has reported that senator kennedy objected to the language and told senator bayh that president kennedy did not know any of the members of his cabinet personally until he appointed them senator kennedy believed that the cabinet then was not close to the president and could not possibly offer the kind of protection against a coup that bayh and the other drafters of the amendment thought they were providing and i agree you cannot give those with the most to gain from a decision the nearly absolute power to make that decision and not epemct a o be abused at some point ompounding the inherent danger caused by the disabty clause are

purposestmder the disability clause of the 25th amendment look at what thwe we have had lately since 1945 but much more so 4n he last decade we have seen the rise of the imperial presidency in this country 1 dare say that perhaps the overwhelming majority of the members in or out of the congress as well as the citizens would say if asked that the president has more power that he is omniscient and that he is of greater power and authority than either one of the other two branches that simply is not true and it is in direct contradiction to the unitedstates constitution yat our presidents have been approaching a position of absolute authority with greater tnomentum every day look at the recent vote by congress to give the president absolute authority to negotiate a freetrade agreement

20 1989 and i was one of onty a handful that opposed the persian gulf wara war that was begun in august of 1990 by the president not in january by he congress when the vote was finally taken i do not take any pleasura in these votes but i am also very sensitive to the fact that we are a coequal and a separate and an 4ndependent body like the other two branches of the government the executive and the judiciary but for good reason the men who wrote the constitution put the lrst article as ihe representative branch the congress ard the second and third articles as the executive and judicial branches in our nations first 10 years of nationhood which really were the first and the second continental congresses our leaders thought so little of this kind of an office that they did not evm bother to have anythng ak il there was no such thing as a president or as they caled it in the constitutional convention delbartions a chief agistrale they did not want to have anything to do with

order to form a more perfect wion we he people not the congress not the president not anybody else but 1he people why because for the irst time in this world then of kings who said t their power came from god they were saying no hat all power comes from he people we have strayed away from that so that when we end up with any possibility and in act the reality that we can have an unelected president and an ilected vice president we have a tonlinuing sword pointed at 1he very heart of our democratic constitutional form of government as the president gains greater end mnore absolute power

radioactive dumping ban act of 1994 the act conforms the unitedstates law to the international treaty known as the london convention which effective february 20 1994 banned the dumping of radioactive waste at sea currently the ocean dumping of radioactive waste is regulated under the ocean dumping act the oda allows dumping of radioactive waste only after congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the united states retains its leadership position in protecting the worlds marine environment the relevance of the united states banning radioactive dumping is far reaching historically the united states has set international policy on ocean dumping of radioactive waste until last year the united states had resisted an international ban through the united states influence the issue was left unresolved that all changed last november when the clinton administration reversed the united states policy and announced its support for a ban the reversal which was brought on in part by heavy lobbying from the

radioactive contamination of the sea on september 30 1993 at my request the oceanography subcommittee held a hearing on the threat of contamination from the russian dumping of nuclear waste for four decades the former soviet union and now the russian republic has been dumping nuclear waste from nuclear submarines and weapons plants into the worlds oceans the information gathered by the subcommittee was sobering the wests first concrete evidence about the dumping came last sumtumer following the release of the yablokov report which was commissioned by president boris yeltsin to detail the extent of soviet nuclear disposal at sea according to the report the soviet union had dumped over 2 5 million curies of radioactive waste into the arctic ocean and other marine environments by comparison the accident at three mile island in my home state of pennsylvania released 15 curies of radiation during the hearing the subcommittee discovered that since 1959 the former soviet union dumped 18 nuclear reactors a reactor screen 11 000 to 17 000 cannisters of nuclear waste and hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of communism moscow has continued to dispose of radioactive waste at sea in october 1993 russia dumped 900 tons of lowlevel radioactive waste in the sea of japan in violation of a previously agreed upon international moratorium according to japanese press accounts high ranking russian officials have admitted that ocean dumping is likely to persist arch 10 1994 the russian pederalk actions f1llowing the october dumping have onv reinforced these fears russia was an of only five nations to abstaia from voting to approve the london convention radioactive dumping ban it ns vember 1993 then just last month it became the only nation to declare its intent not to complw with the new
