of secondary sanctions that apply outside the united states on irans development of ballistic missiles in the wake of the administrations wholesale retreat from multilateral sanctions regarding ballistic missiles if the administration was actually involved in enforcing this this legislation would not be necessary last july secretary of state john kerry testified that the u n security council resolution 2231 which implemented the deal contains the exact same language prohibiting iran from developing ballistic weapons as the previous resolution that sounded pretty encouraging to us oh if only it were true if only it had been true the text of the resolution appears to suggest it is quite the opposite in u n scr 2231 iran is nonbindingly called uponthose are the words called upon to refrain from developing ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear warheads by contrast the original resolution bindingly stated that iran shall notshall notdevelop ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads now here is where we have to focus my friends here is where we have to focus this past spring iranian foreign minister mohammad zarif bragged on this very point and here are his words he said that he negotiated a loophole he negotiated a loophole that would enable the regime to continue to develop nuclearcapable ballistic missiles that is why we are here debating this today what did he say the new resolution he claimedand these are his wordsdoesnt call upon iran not to test ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads no it calls upon iran not to test ballistic missiles that were designed to be capable and he adds that word took me about 7 months to negotiate so everybody knew what it meant as such iran could develop a ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead but then claim it was not designed for that specific purpose later reports indicated that the united states and its european allies issued a joint letter now remember iran has now fired off eight tests the last test on the ballistic weapons on the side of them it said death to israel in farsi and in hebrew and that joint letter stated that irans recent ballistic missile tests werewhat was the word used by the united states now were inconsistent with rather than a violation of the resolution so which is it ultimately the u n fails to impose new sanctions despite irans continued missile tests during this entire debate on the floor this house the talking points indicated that iran would be prevented from developing and using and testing these ballistic missiles for the next 8 years now we find out that apparently the administration intends to allow this continued buildup of their capabilities of an intercontinental ballistic

with key allies and partners and emboldening violent extremists in february the administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at guantanamo bay

dangerous terrorists and some undoubtedly are but some of them are not they are merely people who were captured in some way but who have not been charged or judged as terrorists some of them are

could have rebuilt our infrastructure and transportation system in this country once again creating good jobs and opportunities and laying the foundation for our economy to grow for another trillion of those dollars we could have given the american taxpayers a trilliondollar tax break would they not have loved that and do they not need that instead we are still looking at 2 trillion going forward in taking care of the men and women who served the warriors the patriots the men and women who were willing to stand up and protect us but who lost arms and lost legs and suffered severe brain injuries yes that is right 2 trillion going forward tending to and caring for them and that is a moral obligation that we are obligated to and must fulfill now to my point today last year the congress authorized 500 million to be spent on training the socalled moderate free syrian rebels and now we have learned that only a handful like four to five has shown up for duty according to lloyd austin the unitedstates central commander for troops in the middle east back in june republican congressman curt clawson and i offered an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to stop funding this socalled free syrian rebel program why well the hard cold fact is that many of their leaders told us at the time that they would not use the money to fight and join us in the fight against isil now we ask the house not to appropriate an additional 600 million seeing that the 500 million that was spent has already been wasted and misspent unfortunately our colleagues at the time did not follow our bipartisan recommendation on this important issue and the house did go ahead and appropriate an additional 600 million for that failed program now that we know only a handful are showing up for duty it is not too late to stop this additional 600 million from going forward for this failed program i am calling for the immediate removal of that funding after all we did pass my amendment prohibiting congress from funding socalled rebels where there was clear proof that the money was being misspent the proof could not be more clear in this case this isnt about agreement or disagreement with our involvement in these middle east conflicts this is about the tragic foolish senseless wasteful squandering of 1 1 billion of hardearned american taxpayers dollars mr clawson and i both worked as businessmen for decades before coming to the congress anyone who knows anything about business can tell you this no private sector company ever succeeded by spending huge amounts of money on employees who never showed up for work or worse yet turned their allegiances to an opposition or a competitive company that is no way to run a business that is no way to govern and it is certainly no way to win a war i plead with my colleagues to come to their bipartisan senses join mr clawson and me and help us put an end to this tragic and wasteful spending of hardearned american taxpayer dollars the

hearings the head of the unitedstates department of veterans affairs resigned under congressional pressure and congress has enacted major reform legislation the veterans access to care through choice accountability and transparency act created a 3year program to allow veterans to seek care from private providers if they live too far from a va facility or cannot otherwise get an appointment within 14 days it also gave the va secretary the authority to fire senior executives for poor performance and required a toptobottom study of the entire department to be completed within 1 year of enactment however even with this oversight the obama administration has failed to correct the problems we continue to hear about unacceptable patient wait times unanswered benefit inquiries patient safety concerns medical malpractice flagrant mismanagement infighting corruption and years of construction delays that total millions of dollars when government failure is exposed and legislation aimed at restoring accountability is enacted it makes sense that action would be swift and immediate people would be fired wrongs would begin to be made right unfortunately that has not been the case at the department of veterans affairs while there are as many as 1 000 employees that could potentially face disciplinary actions the va has only fired three people for involvement in the scandal our veterans have earned our respect and they shouldnt have to wait in line for months or years just to see a doctor new documents show that one out of every three waiting for care at the va has already died and recent reports reveal there are now 50 percent more veterans on wait lists for a month or longer than last summer when our brave servicemembers come home we have to keep our word to them by modernizing our va system to deliver the best care in the world in the 114th congress house republicans have passed numerous pieces of legislation designed to help veterans and increase accountability

passed the veterans information modernization act which would give congress and the public access to key data regarding the delivery of health care medical services and nursing home care by the va healthcare system many veterans have contacted us expressing their frustration at having to carry official department of defense discharge papers to prove their military service and last week legislation was signed into law to create an official identification card for veterans just this week we have passed the va accountability act which would provide the va secretary with increased flexibility in removing employees who fail our veterans the hire more heroes act which would make it easier to hire veterans by exempting those who already have health insurance from being counted as
