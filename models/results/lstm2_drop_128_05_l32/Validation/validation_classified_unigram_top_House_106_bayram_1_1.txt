and makes a real commitment to providing prescription drug coverage for senior citizens for these reasons i urge my colleagues to support the sprat alternative and to oppose h con res 290 the spraft alternative saves 100 percent of the surplus generated by social security for social security the majority plan if you assume that the socalled reserve funds for additional tax cuts and medicare are spent actually drains more than 60 billion of the social security surplus over the next ten years even if you assume that the reserve funds are not spent and that social security surplus is not tapped the republican budget still fails to extend the life of either social security or medicare by even one day in contrast the spratt alternative extends social security by 15 years by crediting the trust fund with the interest savings generated by the social security surplus with regard to medicare the republican resolution adds nothing to the solvency of the program while the sprat alternative adds ten years by reserving 300 billion of the onbudget surplus for medicare the spratt alternative makes debt reduction the top fiscal priority rather than exploding tax cuts the chairman of the federal reserve and countless other economists have advised congress that paying down the debt is the best thing we can do to maintain our strong economy eliminating the debt and lowering interest rates is also the best thing congress can do for working families lower interest rates cut mortgage payments by 2 000 for families with a 100 000 mortgage the cost of care loans and student loans would also be reduced paying down the debt is effectively a large tax cut that also lifts a financial burden from our children and grandchildren in addition paying down the debt and extending the life of social security and medicare the spraft alternative provides targeted tax relief for working families the spraft budget allocates more than 210 billion for tax cuts that would allow congress to enact marriage penalty relief estate tax relief for family farmers and small business people full deductibility of health insurance for the selfemployed and tax credits for higher education by targeting resources to families trying to make ends meet the sprat alternative is able to deliver significant tax relief while protecting other key priorities when it comes to prescription drugs the spraft alternative makes a hard commitment of 40 billion over the next five years to provide medicare prescription drug coverage for all senior citizens the spratt alternative will not only allow prescription drug coverage for all senior citizens it will protect lowincome seniors from any costsharing requirements the majority plan on the other hand does not actually dedicate resources for a new prescription drug benefit rather the resolution creates a 40 billion reserve fund that depends on improved future budget projections finally the agriculture function in the spratt alternative is superior to the majority plan the spraft budget provides 6 billion in farmer income assistance for fiscal year 2000 and 7 2 billion to reflect the housepassed crop insurance unlike the gop resolution which freezes discretionary agriculture spending for the next five years the spratt budget provides a responsible increase so that critical agriculture research trade development and marketing

effort democrats have overwhelmingly voted three times in recent years to raise the limit and president clinton has requested repealing this earnings limit in his last two budgets the sooner we send this to his desk the faster we will be able to deliver this relief to seniors who want to continue making a real contribution to our society and our economy unlike a republican attempt to raise the

federal reserve chairman greenspan we are beginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that threatens our economic expansion this bill will play a major role in protecting our economic gains of the last 7 years it will not only help raise the standard of living for many of our seniors but it will also help us keep the strongest economic growth of our lifetime on track by keeping a generation of skilled workers in the edonomy i met with a number of small business owners in south county st louis in my district this past weekend and they talked about their need to hire workers over the age

version of this bill that does much more than is necessary to protect the technology community as a former state court judge i am particularly concerned by the unequivocal rejection of provisions of this bill by the judicial conference of the united states that is a body composed largely of federal judges appointed by presidents reagan and bush this bill takes what the judicial conference describes as a radically different approach with the potential of overwhelming federal resources and the capacity of the federal courts to resolve not only y2k cases but other causes of action as well the united states department of justice has likewise opposed this extreme measure noting that even a defendant who recklessly disregarded a known risk of y2k failure could escape liability the department of justice also opposes this bill because it would preclude federal and state agencies from imposing civil penalties on small businesses for firsttime violations of federal information collection requirements most of the reasonable provisions of this proposal and there are a number of reasonable provisions are so reasonable that they are already the law in texas and in most other places penalties against anyone who brings a frivolous lawsuit a requirement of adequate notice to someone who is going to be sued a coolingoff period an opportunity for a wrongdoer to cure the wrong a duty for the victim to undertake reasonable steps to mitigate or minimize damage and the use of mediation or alternative dispute resolution to avoid a lengthy jury trial to the extent that there may be some deficiency in the laws of the states the state legislatures are the place to deal with these kind of problems and they are dealing with them that is why we have legislatures convene in places like austin texas where the texas legislature is sitting today and only last week the texas legislature unanimously sent to governor george w bush a proposal that he supports that deals in a much less expansive way with this whole y2k issue i increasingly hear that my republican colleagues are pretty enamored with george w and i would just ask if he is good enough for you why is his y2k bill not good enough for them instead by preempting texas law by overriding and essentially saying to the texas legislature and our texas governor that on y2k you are nuts we are suggesting in this legislation

the new millennium with similar grave concern jerry falwell who believes the end is near is predicting a possibility of catastrophe there is a dark vision of the millennium at the planet art network

and bottled water heading for the hills and abandoning the community in anticipation of all the ill that will flow in the millennium change today we see the legislative view of this survivalist approach to y2k this is law making which really fails to build on a bipartisan approach but instead employs a measure that is opposed by every democrat and one republican and supported by every other republican on the judiciary committee rather than trying to come together and find some true middle ground on addressing this y2k issue this bill really is attempting to set a precedent for

carter energy plan convinced that we were running out of natural gas and that the price of oil would soar to 100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own

ago of the national drug control strategy by this administration one would think that they would learn one would think that if we had an experience and had a bad experience that one would learn from that experience what disturbs me and tomorrow we are going to hear from the nati6nal drug czar and i think general mccaffrey has tried to do a good job i think the former drug czar mr brown did a horrible job he presided over death and destruction of this land unparalleled unequal to anything except an attack that we had in pearl harbor but this is the proposal by the administration to deal with the problem now again one would think that they would learn let me tell what is in this first of all they have one of the most clever charts i have ever seen in my life it is i guess clintonesque in its explanation but last year this congress appropriated 17 9 billion for the war on drugs now they managed to develop a chart that showed us going from 17 9 billion to 17 8 billion a net decrease of 109 million and show it on a chart as an increase now that is clever in its presentation but it is disastrous in its effect where do the cuts come in let me tell you where these cuts are that

as a legislator but as well as a physician i practice internal medicine about once a month i see patients for 15 years prior to coming to the congress i practtced internal medicine full time one of the aspects of that for me was i had the opportunity to manage many patients with chronic pain and many patients unfortunately who were terminal who had in many instances metastatic cancer with disease in their bones and there was a lot of pain associated with their condition one of the experiences i discovered was that with time and attention from the attending physician it is possible to manage these patients quite successfully so that there is not suffering indeed one of the things that i discovered was that the patients who suffered with severe pain whether they were terminal or whether they had severe pain from a chronic disease and they were not necessarily terminal the patients who were suffering were the patients who were being managed incorrectly their physicians essentially were incompetent and that is why they were suffering that in the hand of a competent physician these patients can be managed correctly and that their pain can be dealt with their nausea as a complication of their pain medicines can be dealt with indeed even if they were severely depressed as a complication of their illness one could manage them with medications there is a whole plethora of drugs available now the reason why some people believe that physicianassisted suicide is necessary is in my opinion the false assumption that there are these cases that we cannot manage and therefore we have to euthanize these people i argue today before all my colleagues that that is a very very cruel and bogus hoax in competent hands and in compassionate hands we do not have to resort to the extreme measure of managing a patient like we would fido or rover and simply just put them to sleep that we are essentially at the limits of what doctors can do my colleagues there are narcotic pain relieving drugs not only available in pill form there are medications available in suppository form there are medications available that are transcutaneous patches of narcotic pain relievers

priorities that you happen to believe in and putting real numbers with those priorities your numbers add up the concern i have with the presidents budget and it is probably the reason why the congressional black caucus and so many others are providing substitute amendments is they do not agree with the priorities that the president has laid out we did not agree with that either we felt it was important to protect 100 percent of the social security trust fund to strengthen medicare and provide a real prescription drug benefit within that to retire the public debt entirely to promote tax fairness for families farmers seniors to restore americas defense and to do it in a way that recognizes that people do come first and strength for support for education and science let me just talk about medicare because i think this is the one that probably is the most different we have heard so many folks run to the floor today to talk about how their plan looks exactly like the republicans and there is a reason because when the democrats or through the president provided their original proposal what we found out is that the way they paid for a prescription drug benefit was by cutting medicare you cut medicare in one side to pay for increases in another side and those increases did not even take effect to the fourth year so the president held this great rose garden ceremony and had a great 96minute state of the union address and he said how we were all going to have prescription drug benefit and then didnt fund it in the budget he proposed 2 weeks later so i can understand why you would come forward with a substitute amendment a substitute amendment that hopefully does not cut as the president does the kidney program the hospital payments as i said to a gentleman earlier today you cannot close hospitals around this country and extend a prescription drug benefit and call that health care if my hospital in my hometown of manchester iowa closes that is a 30minute drive

strike the requisite number of words and i rise in opposition to the hinchey amendment vera as it is called corrects historic geographic imbalances in funding for va health care services and ensures equitable access to care for all veterans long ago our nation made a commitment to care for the brave men and women who fought the battles to keep america free these are our nations veterans please take note when i say our nations veterans they are not floridas veterans or arizonas veterans or new yorks veterans they are our veterans and we as a nation have a collective responsibility to honor the commitment we make to them when they volunteered to fight for americas freedom no one asked these veterans what part of the country they came from it simply did not matter unfortunately when they came home veterans found out that where they live matters a great deal until the passage of vera a veterans ability to access the va health care system literally depended upon where he or she happened to live since coming to congress and i am sure this is true for most of us i have heard of veterans that were denied care at florida va medical facilities in many instances these veterans had been receiving care at their local va medical center however once they moved to florida the va was forced to turn them away because the facilities in our state simply did not have the resources to meet the high demand for care this lack of adequate resources is further compounded in the winter months when florida veterans are literally crowded out of the system by individuals who travel south to enjoy our warm weather it is hard for my veterans to understand how they could lose their va health care simply by moving to another part of the country or because a veteran from a different state is using our va facilities congress enacted vera for a very simple reason equity no matter where they live or what circumstances they face all veterans deserve to have equal access to quality health care since veras implementation the florida veterans integrated service network visn has treated approximately 44 410 more veterans the florida network estimates that it will treat a total of 285 000 veterans by the end of fiscal year 1999 the florida network has also opened 12 new community based outpatient clinics since veras implementation it plans to open additional clinics in the near future none of this could have happened without vera we have to ask ourselves what happens if vera is not implemented the failure to move forward with an improved and fair funding allocation system would mean that the va would miss a unique opportunity to revitalize its way of doing business the negative impact would be felt most by veterans who would not be treated in areas that are currently underfunded failure to implement vera will waste taxpayers dollars because a rush to the funding practices of the past will mean that some va facilities will receive more money per veteran than others to provide essentially the same care the author of this amendment argues that veterans of new york are not being treated equitably the vera system already takes regional differences into account by making adjustments for labor costs differences in patient mix and differing levels of support for research and education with the 1 7 billion increase in va health care included in h r 2684 va facilities in the metropolitan new york area will receive an average of 5 336 per veteran patient this means that these facilities will receive an average payment for each patient that is 16 11 percent higher than the national average on the other hand the florida visn will receive 4 481 per patient an average payment which is 2 49 percent below the national average how is this inequitable to new yorks veterans if the

ago 1 year ago or even 6 months ago it was the palestinian leadership that rejected compromise and showed that it was not interested in peace not only did they reject baraks offer but they did not even counteroffer in response the violent palestinian riots we are witnessing result directly from the fact that yasir arafat did not prepare his people for peace as barak was restraining the expectationspreparing the israeli people for compromisearafat was pumping up the palestinian de mandspreparing them for conflict we must today say that arafat is not a partner for peace although israel has today taken a time out from the peace process it remains as willing as ever to make peace with its neighbors however israel must have a real partner one that does not engage in incitement to violence one that does not look the other way when their people are destroying ancient shrines such as josephs tomb in nablus one that does not allow their people to beat innocent israelis to death as happened recently in ramallah and one that does everything in its power to set the conditions for peace the underlying basis of negotiations was the recognition of the plo by israel in exchange for the renunciation of violence by the plo and chairman arafat in his september 9 1993 letter to the late prime minister yitzhak rabin chairman arafat renounced the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and pledged to prevent violence and discipline violators unless the palestinian leader calls on his people to halt their fanatical hostile public violence and directs his security services to maintain orderas he promisedthe palestinians will be in violation of not only the text of the peace agreements but the basic understanding which underlay the process furthermore as the palestinian rock and molotov cocktail throwers and gunmen continue to rage israel will be within its rights as a sovereign nation to take whatever actions it needs to protect its people and frontiers now there is
