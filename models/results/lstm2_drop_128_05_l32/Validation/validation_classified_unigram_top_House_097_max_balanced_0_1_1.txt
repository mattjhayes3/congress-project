positions that mr stockman will be recommending to the president take for example the issues of energy decontrol mr stockman is an advocate of total and immediate deregulation of crude oil and gasoline prices he contends that with deregulation we will conserve even more energy and provide further incentives for domestic energy production i do not doubt that we might see slightly more conservation and perhaps slightly more production as a result of decontrol but we should be mindful all the while of the role that rising energy prices have played in the inflationary spiral we find ourselves in we should ask ourselves the question is the price of a little more conservation in the field of energy is the price of perhaps a marginal increase in production worth the cost of giving our economy another inflationary boot in the seat of the pants as oil prices go up consider these statistics for a moment mr president if you will in 1979 all consumer prices rose at a level of about 12 7 percent while energy prices rose at a level of 36 5 percent and in 1980 we found that energy prices were increasing at a clip 50 percent above the rate of inflation generally now some say that we are past energy price shocks they say the price of energy is stabilizing so why not just go that one step further and decontrol all oil prices immediately we stand in daily peril of opec price increases and there is little inclination on the part of these nations to try to help us out of our energy crisis indeed they have been the chief culprit in putting us in that bad shape they quite frequently raise the nrice of oil just as we decontrol prices at home what is the result of price increases and decontrol the result is hyperinflation in energy prices thus the council of economic advisers has estimated that when we began the process of decontrol in june of 1979 combining this with opec price increases in oil through the better part of 1980 we saw a burst of price increases of almost 100 percent during the first 3 months of 1980 for the prices of all oil products we are advisedand mr stockman concursthat 1 e should speed the pace immediately and decontrol the price of oil forthwith something that i think will add considerably to the price of oil and gasoline which may trigger further opec price increases some economists are telling us that immediate decontrol of the remaining regulations dealing with oil and gasoline will result in a 15to 20cent immediate rise in gasoline prices mr stockman has shown little concern for the many millions of americans who as producers and consumers need much needed relief from the energy price spiral and that disturbs me it causes me concern as i consider his nomination to this high and crucial post other matters also

cannot afford such an amnestyespecially at this time we have always been known as a humanitarian nation we have had and continue to have one of the most liberal immigration policies known in the world but the costs of amnesty are so tiemendous that it is difficult to estimate the department of health and human services recently provided in my view some conservative estimatesbased on an estimated 3 to 6 million undocumented aliens residing in this country many believe this figure to be as high as 12 million taking a middle figure of 42 million hhs figured that 45 percent of these would be eligible for amnesty under this legislation this is approximately 24 million people of this figure 15 percent would be eligible for temporary resident status and eligible for permanent status in 3 years additionally hhs estimated that only 60 percent of the 2 million plus eligible undocumented aliens would participate in the program assuming that the public assistance rate for these individuals would initially be lower than that of the american population as a whole but that this rate will eventually rise to meet that rate of the present american populationthat rate is around 9 percenthhs further estimated that the federal public assistance costs alone could be as high as 6 67 billion over the next 5 years but we have an alternative as described by the gentlemans amendment approximately 10 percent of the undocumented aliens believed to be in the country have been here for 10 years or longer these individuals arefor the most partwell integrated into their communities have children who are unitedstates citizens and are entitled to be recognized as productive and desirable additions to our population these individuals can be provided for under the gentlemans

intactupdated to 1973and we can avoid the unmanageable burden that would otherwise be created by this bill rather than eliminating laws we cannot enforce we should seek to better enforce them i urge your support of tis amendment i rise today in support of my amendment offered to restore the ceiling on legal immigration since debate djd not proceed to the appropriate title i offer this explanation for the record and thereby for future consideration the 1970s became a turning point for unitedstates immiigration it became clear that changes must be made in our policies for dealing with the influx of immigrants seeking a better life many months have gone into the preparation of the legislation before us today and i commend my colleagues for their diligent and wellintended efforts however this bill contains a lethal combination in addition to providing no cap on legal inunigration we will be opening the dcors to millions of illegal aliens under tne amnesty provisions in this bill this amendment will allow us to achieveat the very leastsome control over legal immigration by setting an annual ceiling of 425 000approximately our present level of legal immigration the american people do not support massive immigration in repeated public opinion polls 80 percent of those polled wanted legal admissions reduced below 400 000 per year no reasonable person involved in immigration reform wants to stop immigration entirely but we are concerned about the growing resentment of immigrants and immigration with over 10 million americans out of workand i know this concerns my colleagues because just the other day the house passed legislation to restrict foreign competition in an attempt to preserve american jobsand with growing government deficits we cannot afford to simply open our doors to all who wish to come here the demographics and costs of immigration are staggering according to the 1979 justice statistical yearbook 270 000 immigrants were admitted that year under our system of preferences for relatives of american citizens alone fully onethird of this number came under the fifth preferencebrothers and sisters of unitedstates citizens and their spouses and children this is in my view chain migration at its best above and beyond the 270 000 legal relative immigrants we admitted 218 000 refugees once these immigrants achieve permanent residence he she and their dependents become eligible for all the benefits of unitedstates citizenspublic assistance such as food stamps afdc and ss1 additionally in 1979 nearly 1 1 million undocumented aliens were apprehended in this country conservative estidmates show that over 80 000 undocumentedor illegalaliens have entered this country each year since for the sake of argument i offer findings of several studies one study found that 29 percent of illegal dominicans in new york city received welfare another study found 18 5 percent of a group of undocumented women in los angeles to be receiving welfare a study of unemployment insurance applications from aliens in ii linois found 46 to 51 percent of them to be illegal i point to these studies only to em phasize that the costs of immigration have not been sufficiently documented for us to make the sweeping reforms that this legislation proposes we cannot possibly control the costs of illegalimmigration if we cannot put a hold on the costs of legal immigration at a time when government pro grams are being pared this legislation is a further threat to our social service system we have three options first to increase spending for our social services second to reduce services to our most needy citizens or third to control immigration i suggest to my colleagues that this final option is not only the most

reasons why this legislation is important for restoring the competitiveness of unitedstatesbased banks in the international marketwhich chairman st germain has so clearly donei would like to focus briefly on one particularly important aspect of this legislation unlike the budget and spending bills that we have spent most of our time on this year this bill is not a tug of war between budget functions between regions of the country or between democrats and republicans there will be winners but no losers since so little of the business that ibfs will engage in is currently conducted in the united states not even the banks will be fighting a zerosum game simply stated a very large market that has been pushed overseas by a series of regulations will be brought back home the exact size of this market is unknown but estimates range in the tens of billions of dollars the successful operation on ibfs in the united states will not only enhance the prestige and desirability of the united states as an international banking center but will also have important concrete benefits first and foremost there will be a net increase of jobs in the banking industry and in ancillary service industries second ibfs will generate new tax revenues since the treasury will be collecting tax payments rather than issuing credits for taxes paid to foreign governments finally oversight of the international operations of unitedstates banks will be made easier by having these operations conducted at home rather than abroad h r 4879 reprcsents the logical and necessary conclusion to the process of creating an improved framework under which unitedstates based banks can compete for international deposits and loans in international markets by exempting international banking facilities deposits from the fdic insurance assessment wve will remove the final legal and regulatory obstacle to the successful operation of international banking facilities in the united states while i would like to stress the imiportance of the bill it should be madie clear at the outset that the bill does not alter fundamental domestic banking structure which the committee will conduct hearings on in the future rather the major effect of this legislation will be to allow banking business that is currently being conducted overseas to be conducted rt home as some of the members may know an international banking facility or ibf is not a physical entity but is a strictly international account that is used for purely international transactions an ibf would not compete for retail deposits with domestic banks it may transact business only with foreign residents foreign banks and central banks foreign branches of unitedstates banks other ibfs and its parent institution the minimum account would be 100 000 the foundation for the establishment of ibfs was laid in the international banking act of 1978 which was largely a result of chairman sr germains interest and effort in june of this year the federal reserve board took another step toward the establishment of ibfs when it published regulations exempting ibf deposits from interest rate limitations and reserve requirements these regulations will take effect or december 3 1981 in anticipation of this date nine states have changed their tax laws in order to foster the growth of ibfs in their state banking centers those states are new york california connecticut georgia illinois florida nort~h carolina mississippi and maryland the exemption of ibf deposits from the fdic insurance assessment can be seen as a vital step in making domestic ibfs competitive when one factors this assessment into a typical international monetary decision nearly half of the interbank placements carry margins of onesixteenth of 1 percent which is less than the onetwelfth of 1 percent assessment the spread on loam generally ranges between threeeighths of 1 percent and fiveeighths of 1 percent therefore adding the burden of fdic insurance will cut into profitability and cut into competiveness the formation of competitive ibfs in the united states opens up a huge market for american banks precise estimates of the size of the market are difficult to find but there is no doubt that it reaches into the tens of billions of dollars since so little of the business ibfs will engage in is currently conducted in the united states unitedstates ibfs will not be fighting a zerosum game with each other first and foremost there will be a net increase of jobs in the banking industry and in ancillary service industries second ibfs will generate new revenue for the treasury since tax credits formerly granted to unitedstates banks for taxes paid to foreign governments will be replaced by taxes actually paid to the treasury ibf payrolls will ripple through the economy generating additional state and local tax revenues finally oversight of the international operations of unitedstates banks will be made easier by having these operations conducted at home rather than abroad i believe that the benefits from the growth of domestic ibfs provide compelling reasons for taking the final step as provided for by h r 4879"],

literally going through the ceiling in spite of surplus supplies over just the last year rates have gone up an average of 25 percent this situation is intolerable and it is one that we have to deal with quickly to that end i am introducing two bills today which i urge all of you to support my first bill would roll back gas prices to their october 1 levels and freeze them there through the end of 1984 that would give us the time we need to review the natural gas policy act and to make needed changes while protecting consumers in the meantime the second bill would strike down take or pay clauses now in effect and prohibit such clauses in new contracts take or pay provisions in contracts have locked pipelines into purchasing large amounts of costly new and decontrolled gas while lower priced old gas is left sitting in the ground they are throwing the market way out of balance unde the bill certain present take or pay provisions could be reinstated after ferc review if they are found to be necessary to prevent disruption of underlying financial agree ments and if they would not lead to unreasonable consumer prices i keep hearing this issue is too complicated for
