most of the issues that come before this congress as it relates to not only the purpose of us but the prosperity of the american people i rise today in strong strong opposition to this bill h r 2681 i call it the dirty cement pollution bill lets be perfectly clear this bill this measure is not about jobs for the chairman of the subcommittee and my friend just to try to persuade members of this body that this is about jobs i think that its the worst kind of politics jobs now is the useful canard but this is not about jobs this is about an industry that is singular in its being eliminated or being not under the auspices of the clean air act and about an industry that is unique because it doesnt have to adhere to any of the provisions of the clean air act and its about time that this industry be included with other industries in this nation to come under the auspices the jurisdiction and the standards of the clean air act cement kilns emit nearly 8 tons of mercury each year making them the nations secondlargest mercury emitting source before the epa issued its 2010 air toxics rule these emissions remained essentially unrestrained due to the lack of controls for cement kilns regulating the release of mercury into the atmosphere h r 2681 would roll back existing clean air act standards by revoking three clean air act rules including the only national limits on emissions of air toxics such as mercury from cement kilns this dirty cement pollution bill will also require epa to propose and finalize weaker replacement rules that will allow for more pollution than the law currently permits this bill is intended to significantly change how epa sets the standards when issuing the alternative rules h r 2681 would indefinitely delay the reductions of air toxics and other hazardous pollutants by prohibiting epa from finalizing replacement rules prior to march 2013 if this bill were to be enacted at the end of this year also this bill does not include any statutory deadline for when polluters must reduce emissions leaving the process ambiguous and openended at the very least this dirty cement pollution bill would postpone emission reductions from cement kilns until at least 2018a 41 2year delay in fact the health safeguards from these standards are long long long long overdue epa just finalized standards for cement plants in september of last year making them 13 years overdue under the clean air act amendments of 199013 years overdue already they are overdue 13 years the science tells us that these dirty air toxics can cause a variety of serious health effects

taking too much that they reallytheyre taking america for a ride and we have to cut medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of

the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this republican

eliminate the guarantee that you as a senior have had for more than 35 years under medicare to choose your doctor and your hospital and we must impose upon you an additional 6 000 in health care costs because these deficits are so big so as the president said a couple of days ago under the republican budget you would need to take 22 seniors paying 6 000 additional dollars to cover the costs of

energy independence and protect consumers improve vehicle efficiency boost production of domestic renewable energy and convert oil industry tax breaks into gas price relief for consumers america owns 3 percent of the worlds oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves the only way to end our dependence on foreign oil and reduce gas prices is by improving automobile efficiency and developing new sources of clean domestic energy energy independence is going to depend on reducing our oil consumption and shifting to domestic forms of energy like wind solar biofuels and most importantly improved efficiency energy independence will save consumers money and protect us from political instability in the middle east at the end of 2010 congress extended tax credits for biofuels and the production of wind and solar energy those tax credits increased wind energy production by nearly 43 percent in less than 2 years so extending them now is important for energy independence under the

to require that this toxic material be disposed of carefully this bill turns a blind eye to evidence of known hazards and takes us back to the dark ages to a time before science was valued and before

19th century they also wish to return us to the 19thcentury principles about public health and the environment regarding arsenic and mercury and their danger to the citizens of our country now there are good uses for coal ash beneficial uses it can be used to construct highways and shingles thats good it can be mixed into concrete and grout thats good but what we dont want is for the industry to be able to use it to construct a golf course like what they did in battlefield virginia because it can directly contaminate the groundwater it can pollute and cause injury and cancers in the neighbors

our transportation infrastructure will be in peril even senate republicans have recognized the dangers inherent in allowing this to occur and have joined with senate democrats to craft a bipartisan

will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the

also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government

thrived at the expense of struggling western network companies and is quietly building and investing in its own brand of highend smart phones and tablets but many americans may not be aware that numerous government reports have linked huaweis corporate leadership to the peoples liberation army raising serious concerns about its products being used for espionage by the chinese government last week respected national security reporter bill gertz wrote new information about chinese civilian telecommunications companies close support of the chinese military and information warfare programs is raising fresh concerns that is why both the bush administration and the obama administration have repeatedly intervened to block huaweis growth huawei is controlled by the same government that jails catholic bishops and protestant pastors oppresses the uyghur muslims has plundered tibet and that is providing the very rockets that sudanese president bashir is using to kill his own people the american people have a right to know whether their government is doing everything it can to protect their cell phone and data networks from foreign espionage and cyberattacks as huawei increases its lobbying presence in washington the american people should be fully aware of the firms intimate links to the pla and the serious concerns of our defense and intelligence community i rise today to share troubling information that has come to my attention about huawei a chinese telecom firm which is attempting to increase its market share in the united states and around the world numerous government reports have linked huaweis corporate leadership to the chinese intelligence services and the peoples liberation army pla raising concerns about huawei networks and devices being subject to espionage by the chinese government these connections are particularly noteworthy given huaweis rapid rise as a telecom giant according to an article in yesterdays wall street journal huawei technologies co has almost doubled its work force over the past five years as it strives to become a mobile technology heavyweight the article also noted that huaweis network business has thrived at the expense of struggling western network companies such as alcatellucent co and nokia siemens networks initially huawei supplied lowcost phones to telecommunications operators in the west under their own brand but over the past year huawei has also been quietly building and investing in its own brand of highend smartphones and tablets huawei executives make no secret of their goal to dominate the telecom market in a march 6 2012 interview with the technology news web site engadget huawei device chief richard yu said in three years we want huawei to be the industrys top brand however huaweis growth in the unitedstates market should give all americans serious pause last week respected national security reporter bill gertz wrote in the washington free beacon that new information about chinese civilian telecommunications companies close support of the chinese military and information warfare programs is raising fresh concerns about the companies access to unitedstates markets according to a report by the congressional uschina economic and security review commission one of the companies identified in the report as linked to the peoples liberation army pla is huawei technologies a global network hardware manufacturer that has twice been blocked by the unitedstates government since 2008 from trying to buy into unitedstates telecommunications firms the congressional report noted that huawei is a well established supplier of specialized telecommunications equipment training and related technology to the pla that has along with others such as zhongxing and datang received direct funding for r d on c41sr systems capabilities the report further added all of these firms originated as state research institutes and continue to receive preferential funding and support from the pla the report said huaweis efforts to sell telecom equipment to unitedstates networks have long troubled the unitedstates defense and intelligence community which has been concerned that huaweis equipment could be easily compromised and used in chinese cyberattacks against the unitedstates or to intercept phone calls and emails from american telecom networks according to a 2005 report by the rand corporation both the government and the military tout huawei as a national champion and one does not need to dig too deeply to discover that are the public face for sprang from or are significantly engaged in joint research with state research institutes under the ministry of information industry defenseindustrial corporations or the military in fact in 2009 the washington post reported that the national security agency called at t because of fears that chinas intelligence agencies could insert digital trapdoors into huaweis technology that would serve as secret listening posts in the unitedstates communications network over the last several years huaweis top executives deep connections to the peoples liberation army and chinese intelligence have been well documented as gertz summarized in his article a unitedstates intelligence report produced last fall stated that huawei technologies was linked to the ministry of state security specifically through huaweis chairwoman sun yafang who worked for the ministry of state security mss communications department before joining the company that is why senior administration officials in the bush and obama administrations have repeatedly intervened to block huaweis access to unitedstates networks in 2008 the treasury departmentled committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius blocked huawei from purchasing the unitedstates telecommunications firm 3com due to the companys links to the chinese military gertz reported last year under pressure from the unitedstates government huawei abandoned their efforts to purchase the unitedstates server technology company 3leaf in 2010 congress opposed huaweis proposal to supply mobile telecommunications gear to sprint over concerns that sprint was a major supplier to the unitedstates military and intelligence agencies its not just huaweis longstanding and tight connections to chinese intelligence that should trouble us huawei has also been a leading supplier of critical telecom services to some of the worst regimes around the world last year the wall street journal reported that huawei now dominates irans governmentcontrolled mobilephone industry it plays a role in enabling irans state security network gertz reported that huawei has also been linked to sanctionsbusting in saddam husseins iraq during the 1990s when the company helped network iraqi air defenses at a time when unitedstates and allied jets were flying patrols to enforce a nofly zone the company also worked with the taliban during its short reign in afghanistan to install a phone system in kabul given all of this information there should be no doubt huawei poses a serious national and economic security threat to the unitedstates it is no secret that the peoples republic of china has developed the most aggressive espionage operation in modern history especially given its focus on cyberattacks and cyberespionage perhaps that is why beijing has ensured that huawei is able to continue its global market growth by unsustainably low prices and goverment export assistance according to january 2011 congressional report on the national security implications of chinese telecom companies due to chinas secrecy the full extent of huaweis subsidies are not be fully known but given its unrealistically low prices it remains unknown whether huawei is even making a profit as it seeks to dominate the telecom market why would the chinese government be willing to generously subsidize such unprofitable products earlier this year the economist magazine published a special report on communist party management of chinese corporations the economist reported that the party has cells in most big companiesin the private as well as stateowned sectorcomplete with their own offices and files on employees it holds meetings that shadow formal board meetings and often trump their decisions the chinese even have an expression for this strategy the state advances while the private sector retreats author richard mcgregor wrote that the executives at chinese companies have a red machine with an encrypted line to beijing next to their bloomberg terminals and personal items on their desks last year the financial times reported that the pla has even documented how it will use telecom firms for foreign espionage and cyberattacks a paper published in the chinese academy of military sciences journal noted should preferably be set up in the telecom sector in the electronics and internet industries and in institutions of scientific research and its tasks should include stealing changing and erasing data on enemy networks and their intrusion with the goal of deception jamming disruption throttling and paralysis the same article also documented the growing number plaled cyber militias housed in private chinese telecom firms the article reported on one example at the firm nanhao many of its 500 employees in hengshui just southwest of beijing have a second job since 2005 nanhao has been home to a cybermilitia unit organized by the peoples liberation army the nanhao operation is one of thousands set up by the chinese military over the past decade in technology companies and universities around the country these units form the backbone of the countrys internet warfare forces increasingly seen as a serious threat at a time of escalating global cybertensions senior unitedstates military and intelligence officials have become increasingly vocal about their concerns about the scope of chinese espionage and cyberattacks according to recent testimony given before the senate defense intelligence agency chief general ron burgess said china has used its intelligence services to gather information via a significant network of agents and contacts using a variety of methods in recent years multiple cases of economic espionage and theft of dualuse and military technology have uncovered pervasive chinese collection efforts last year the reticent office of the national counterintelligence executive issued a warning that chinese actors are the worlds most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage the counterintelligence office took this rare step of singling out the chinese due to the severity of the threat to unitedstates national and economic security and march 8 2012 washington post article described how for a decade or more chinese military officials have talked about conducting warfare in cyberspace but in recent years they have progressed to testing attack capabilities during exercises the probably would target transportation and logistics networks before an actual conflict to try to delay or disrupt the united states ability to fight according to the report prepared by northrop grumman for the unitedstates china economic and security review commission we are beginning to witness the consequences of this strategy according to a march 13 2012 new york times article during the fivemonth period between october and february there were 86 reported attacks on computer systems in the united states that control critical infrastructure factories and databases according to the department of homeland security compared with 11 over the same period a year ago in an interview with the new york times homeland security secretary janet napolitano said i think general dempsey said it best when he said that prior to 9 11 there were all kinds of information out there that a catastrophic attack was looming the information on a cyberattack is at the same frequency and intensity and is bubbling at the same level and we should not wait for an attack in order to do something a 2010 pentagon report found in the case of key national security technologies controlled equipment and other materials not readily obtainable through commercial means or academia the peoples republic of china resorts to more focused efforts including the use of its intelligence services and otherthan legal means in violation of unitedstates laws and export controls the report also highlighted chinas cyberespionage efforts the unitedstates intelligence community notes that chinas attempts to penetrate unitedstates agencies are the most aggressive of all foreign intelligence organizations notably chinese espionage isnt limited to government agencies in an october 4 washington post article rep mike rogers chairman of the house intelligence committee remarked when you talk to these companies behind closed doors they describe attacks that originate in china and have a level of sophistication and are clearly supported by a level of resources that can only be a nationstate entity this prolific espionage is having a real and corrosive effect on job creation last year the washington post reported that the head of the militarys unitedstates cyber command gen keith alexander said that one unitedstates company recently lost 1 billion worth of intellectual property over the course of a couple of daystechnology that theyd worked on for 20plus yearsstolen by one of the adversaries that is why in february 2012 testimony before the senate select committee on intelligence fbi director robert mueller said that while terrorism is the greatest threat today down the road the cyber threat will be the number one threat to the country i firmly believe that huawei is one face of this emerging threat and the american people have a right to know whether their government is doing everything it can to protect their
