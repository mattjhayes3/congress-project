availability of energy resources affect the availability of timber resources for housing and many other items of national importance i believe the founding fathers would be proud of this kind of a debate because we are wrestling with important policy issues we did the same thing in the subcommittee i realize it sounds very seductive to say let us take 3 2 but why not 6 4 or 10 9 you can pick any number but the bottom line is in evaluating the needs we had to meet we have taken a responsible position most of the speakers even though supporting cutting amendments have said that again i want to point out that while all of the demands for housing for timber for visitations to the national resources for energy are up we are down from 1981 considerably we are even down from last year if you take it program by program i do recognize that we have some 600 million for spro but i want to point out to all of you most people are not aware of this that in 1976 this nation entered into an energy sharing agreement with many other countries this agreement is called the agreement in international energy program this agreement is in force today and it requires our nation along with others to share oil stocks in the event of crisis this is a result of the crisis of the early 1970s it makes a commitment to establish an emergency energy reserve among about 15 different nations the agreement provides that if there is a crisis such as an opec embargo such as a persian gulf shortage that we have to share with others in one out of three ways oil stocks sharing fuel switching br sharing standby reserves that is in force today this is the reason we are putting oil in spro in part it is not just because of having the reserve for the united states but because we have an agreement and if we cannot honor this agreement we will have to take oil shortage out of current supplies therefore spro becomes extremely important to the united states and to its energy independence this is why we put in a minimum amount as we evaluated it for spro the money for the pay raise is required by law there is no choice that is the law i could go on but i am not going to take the time to do it the

home heating in the northeast that is four barrels additional for those many millions of cars in california for the tractors and factors of the midwest and also to meet our obligations under this

result of this bill the net cost is 1 billion you can take a 3 2percent cut sure however at the same time you have cut the revenues that will be available because we will do less research build fewer

this section for the purpose of offering these amendments h r 1158 as written would be the first chil rights bill to inelude familial status as a protective class we have not adequately explored the potential issues surrounding such a classification therefore this amendment would not only strike that provision of the bill dealing with familial status but it would also mandate a study by the unitedstates commission on civil rights on discrimination based on familial status should the commission find that there is substantial discrimination then congress should take appropriate action to protect families with children the appropriate action is not that action taken by this particular bill this bill in its present form would outlaw senior communities now it was not intended to do such a sweeping act granted but by its very words the very verbiage in the act in itself that is exactly what it does there is an exception in the act that i would like to point out to the committee it says 2 as used in this sulsection housing for older person 4 means housing conunullities consilsting of dwellings a intended for and at least 90 percent occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit and prolding significant facilities and services specifically designed to mect the physical or social needs of such persons now i immediately raised a question of great concern what type of services and facilities do people aged 55 years need that the re t of the cornmunity does not need in looking for that i went to the report language and found this such facilities and services include congre gate dining facilities social and recreational programs emergency and prevention health care or prograns continuing education welfare information and counseling recreational hormeniaker outside nlalitenance and referral service transportation to facilities access to social servicesand services designed to encourage and cssist recipients to use the services and facilities avmilable to them after determining that then it was necessary to find out how much these services would cost in doing that i found that the facilities required in the first exemption would cost anywhere from 400 to 1 095 per month the cost is 400 which is the hud congregate services and 1 195 per month with is the vantage house in maryland tloir charges for such scivices so what we have essentially done is put senior citizen housing outside of tile ability to pay of most of our senior citizens granted discrimination is not right when practiced against anybody but i do not think that tile senior citizens who wish to malialnai and live in a senior community should be told by us here in washington dc that they no longer can do so there is a second exception in tile bill where it says that tie facilities are intended for and occupied solely by persons 64 years of age or oldcr i do not know what in the world we are thinking about there all we are doing is saying that all the senior citizens in the communities that would want to maintain that eligibility would be required to absolutely ban people under the age of 62 years of age perhaps an older gentleman would decide to marry a wife that is 55 years of age immediately they would have to leave the senior community because they would jeopardize the exemption set forth in this hill again i do not attack the motives of the framers of thils bill i llinl they were stralghtforward and they tried as best they could to exempt senior communities but they missed i tried to work up language that would perfect tle language in here but exclude senior coniniunlties and i could not draft it either that in a problem that we have what the comnlttee has done is and i think without any exception has outlawed the senior coinnunities all across the country i do not tilnk that was our intent but the only way to correct tha error is to strike this provision of the bill i urge passage of my amendment"], [0.000747382640838623, 0.5007473826408386, 0,

there are more radio stations and on the face of it it is a tempting amendment to support it is like most weakening amendments it has a kernel of goodness but it is surrounded by a lot of bad i urge my colleagues not to support the green amendment while there are more radio stations than there are television stations there plainly are not enough to provide the plentiful forum we need to air especially local news i happen to represent a rural area my friend from manhattan represents obviously an urban district there are more radio stations in his district i am lucky in one of my counties to have more than one or two stations it is vital that both sides of the issues all sides of issues be presented in my county it is important to realize that even in an urban area however all radio stations are not the same there are important market niches and i would hate to see the day in this country in which for example most of the talk show radios or most of the upscale youth market radio stations or most of the easy listening radio stations were dominated by one group or another that did not allow opposite points of view to be broadcast so while this amendment is appealing on its face it does have a certain superficial appeal it is very important for members to understand the danger of this amendment certainly any member that represents any rural area but even those who represent urban areas should understand that there are market niches in the radio business it is important that no market niche be dominated by a group that would prevent opposing views from being broadcast what is wrong with the idea of presenting opposing viewpoints it is important it has been the american way for over 50 years now i would urge we go ahead and codify the status quo for any members who do have doubts next time they listen to one of the presidents weekly radio messages think of what it would be like if that local station carrying that message chose not to broadcast the democratic response one day there will be a democratic president again and my republican colleague should realize what it would be like if the local station chose not to carry a republican response to a democratic president there are more radio stations but there are still not enough therefore i oppose the green amendment"]]}
