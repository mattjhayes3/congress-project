basing mode for unitedstates icbms we considered the multiple protective system to hide a number of icbms in a large number of holes in the ground mps failed for political reasons we considered the racetrack basing mode racetrack also failed the list goes on and on we have presently put our mx missiles in minuteman iii silos which are fixed identified targets for political reasons this is the best that we could come up with we continuously hear that opponents of mx oppose it because it is vulnerable in a fixed silo so why not harden it the fact is you cannot adequately harden missile silos because improvements in missile accuracy will overcome silo hardness every time you cannot adequately harden a silo against a direct hit or a near hit of a nuclear weapon just as we have increased our missile accuracy so too have the soviets so we know we must have a more survivable system to reiterate the defense department has been attempting to develop such a survivable system they came up with an idea of housing it in and launching it from an airplane this idea fell by the wayside they came up with the idea of burying missiles thousands of feet under ground so that when the shooting was over it could dig itself out and be launched we have considered numerous schemes some good some bad at present the administration has come up with a basing mode similar to that the soviets are using on their ss24s the soviets have built and are in the process of deploying a rail mobile ss24 missile system they do not worry about public opinion in the soviet union so their mobile systems are not even stationed in garrisons but as the soviets realize and our own intelligence experts tell us there is no way you can target all rail mobile systems you cannot be sure where they all are all the time this is what we are proposing to do with rail garrison except we will station them in garrisons until such time as there is a threat rail garrisoned missiles will not be roaming the rail network during peacetime rail garrison is similar to how we dis perse our aircraft in times of an alert and similar to how we plan to disperse our small mobile missile when deployed in the event of a soviet nuclear attack we will have some warning time and it does not make any difference if we can only disperse them 5 miles 50 miles or 500 miles you have built in an uncertainty factor and a survivability factor so that a potential enemy could never be sure that a first strike will be successful this is what congress asked and the scowcroft commission recommended the defense department to dobuild a more survivable system the money is in here because the members of the committee thought it the responsible thing to do we are going forward to develop the concept although the mx will fit on it the small mobile will also fit on it as will any followon missile but we are only developing a concept and the committee has approved 250 million for this which incidentally is a reduction of about 250 million from what the administration requested we would like to develop the concept in no way is rail garrison a threat to the small mobile missile in fact the small mobile missile could ultimately be deployed on this rail concept please do not deny the department of defense the capability of developing this concept this is a research and development program to develop the rail garrison concept so that in time of crisis or even war we could disperse a percentage of our icbms as we would disperse the small mobile missile our bombers and the other strategic systems rail garrison makes sense it is what we have been working toward it is less expensive than the alternatives that have been proposed and certainly much cheaper than the basing and operational plan for midgetman it is about 15 billion

associations the vnas have a long and colorful history the first vna was established in buffalo ny in 1885 by elizabeth coo marshall who collected money from her sunday school class and other concerned citizens to provide health care to the indigent in the community the early mission of the visiting nurse associations was twofold to ensure the survival of infants and children by providing mothers and babies with milk nutritional foods and advice and health care and to combat contagious diseases by cleaning homes over the years visiting nurse associations provided health care and dis3ase pruvention education to immigrants who did not understand english well enough to survive in their new homeland vnas battled plagues and contagious diseases in western mining camps and they taught cooking skills and first aid to camp fire girls and boy scouts today the concept of the visiting nurse developed by florence nightingale and william raithbone in england is embodied in the more than 500 visiting nurse associations operating in almost every state in the union the mission of the vnas has changed over time but the desire to make home health care available to anyone who needs it

its own rationale first we were told that it was vital to protect the interest of our allies but in venice when our allies were asked they saw no interest to protect and no policy to support then we were told it was because of american oil dependence only to discover that 6 percent of american oil comes from the gulf and that kuwait provides only 15 percent of all oil in the region and that indeed most of the oil is flowing over land and only iran has an exclusive dependency for exporting through the gulf then we were told that it was the sanctity of freedom of the seas indeed but the only ships we are protecting are kuwati not international shipping not even ships owned by american companies bringing oil to america under foreign flags there is no issue of sanctity of international shipping fourth we were told that it was the interest of our friends in the gulf our friends who have denied access for american air cover to defend our own naval vessels then finally it was the question of the soviet union this is the question that when the presidents chiefs of staff were asked they thought perhaps it was a good thing this is the soviet presence that has now been offered to be withdrawn the soviet presence which consists of three mine sweepers this now is the final the last gasping rationale of an american policy i know that members feel a responsibility to support the

stood on this particular issue no we have had several votes in just the last few weeks on where this congress stands and it is unequivocally clear to me and it should be to everyone that the vast

amendment protection and that indecency can be regulated to prevent access by children but under the proposal before us today the obscene and indecent messages over the telephone will be continued to be permitted second the proposed amendment will not solve the problem for interstate telephone calls interstate access to local 976 services or to longdistance 900 services will be allowed to contintie the ability to selectively unblock 976 services everywhere at a customers request is not possible thus the proposed house amendment will not guarantee the immediate use of selected interstate blocking and dialaporn will still be available on an interstate basis third the proposed amendment before us obliges the telephone companies to block only if it is technologically feasible if blocking is not technologically feasible the telephone company is under no obligation to block dialaporn at all further the amendment would inevitably give a rise to disputes over what is feasible who should decide what is feasible et cetera fourth the proposed amendment authorizes the telephone companies to block dialaporn services only if the telephone company does not provide billing and collection services however telephone companies which continue to carry dialaporn services but do not provide the billing and collection thus under this proposal any telephone company that does not offer billing and collection services would be exempted entirely from the requirement to block dialaporn and could continue to carry it finally the proposal gives the telephone company the ability to discriminate among messagjes on the basis of content if we wish to explore contentbased solutions that discriminate against dialaporn messages we should be exploring approaches that would result in the banning of messages which are outside first amendment protection the houses original instruction was to solve the problem not to adopt a solution which is a proposed technical fix but creates additional problems i think the clear message from this house of representatives ought to be that we do not want dialaporn offered on our telephone services in this country we have not been able to

around at 45 seconds again that is an estimated number i am not revealing anything classified this midgetman system with two warheads would offload its rvs in 45 seconds to 1 2 minutes as opposed to possibly 7 minutes for the postboost phase of an mx missile that makes the midgetman superior not o liy because of its mobility and the fact that it presents 250 missiles to target in the postboost phase but also because in the postboost phase its of fload and its rvs faster therefore the midgetman is much more survivable in the world that some project toward the end of the next decade when
