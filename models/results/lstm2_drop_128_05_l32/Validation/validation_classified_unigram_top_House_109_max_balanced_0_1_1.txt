that we had to fund and improve the interoperability so that across all of the jurisdiction all of the intelligence and law enforcement jurisdictions that there could be communication the fbi couldnt talk to the firefighters couldnt talk to the police officers and today 5 years later that is still not in place even though it was a recommendation of the 9 11 commission and it boils down to funding

named for were in bloom yet by the time sarah was 14 she had learned five languages three indian dialects english and spanish when she was older she used these talents as an interpreter for the bureau of indian affairs and the unitedstates army sarah spent her life as a champion of the paiutes in nevada and across the country in 1879 she went on a nationwide speaking tour to teach people about the indian culture and the difficult life on the indian reservations trying to bridge two seemingly incompatible cultures sarah gave more than 400 speeches to publicize the injustices suffered by the

could result in a hazardous release and thousands of casualties currently our 147th air wing provides air security in the area and the solution from the pentagonis rotating several planes to fly on

stretches the length of the houston ship channel and continues along the coast through beaumont texas we have seen in the aftermath of katrina and rita the negative effects caused by disruptions in our oil supply and refining capacity and leaving this area unprotected is leaving the door open to a terrorist attack on this critical infrastructure the port of houston is the second largest petrochemical complex in the world and the largest in the western hemisphere which produces over 35 percent of the nations gasoline at a great many refineries numerous chemical plants also line the channel producing a number of volatile compounds according to the unitedstates coast guard 7 600 deep draft vessels arrive each year and 60 percent of those ships carry sensitive oil chemical cargos an airborne attack on the refinery chemical complex could seriously disrupt the nations energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release with thousands of casualties currently the 147th fighter wing of the texas air national guard provides air security in the area and could respond to a threat on the complex or at the port in minutes because of the close proximity rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington provides a much smaller deterrent thanaving a full squadron permanently stationed there and would not provide enough planes to respond to multiple attacks on multiple targets in the area meanwhile the closest full squadron would be in san antonio and would take approximately 23 minutes longer to respond to a threat than the f16s at ellington can currently provide in addition to providing security for the houston area the 147th is capable of providing precision strikes close air

prevent terrorists from entering the united states not an effort to play partisan politics over immigration reform i would like to take them at their word but if this bill really were about keeping terrorists out of the country why is the republican majority not talking about the real threats of terrorists entry why is the republican majority not concerned about the complete lack of an interagency border security plan and why does the presidents budget not fully fund the mandates in the 9 11 intelligence bill which we passed and he signed a few short months ago why sign a bill if you have no intention of actually funding the items in the bill just one example the presidents budget only provides for 210 new border patrol agents even though the 9 11 intelligence bill authorized up to 2 000 we have caught at least one suspected terrorist who illegally waded across the rio grande why is the republican majority not talking about the failure of this administration to ensure that our frontline officers are able to check suspicious individuals against a comprehensive terrorist watch list more than 3 years after 9 11 why are more of our frontline personnel using obsolete namechecking systems that have trouble telling the difference between bin laden and lyndon is this real security does this make america safer this bill wholly fails to address these and other critical gaps in our border security the bill focuses on people already in the united states instead of keeping terrorists out the one aspect of this bill that seems directed at keeping people out of the united states is section 102 i understand this section originated from a desire to complete approximately 3 miles of a 14mile fence along the border near san diego let me be clear i am not against building a fende but i do not think a fence will keep terrorists out of america homeland security expert stephen flynn who is a retired commander of the unitedstates coast guard and jeane kirkpatrick senior fellow in national security studies at the council on foreign relations testified before the senate foreign relations committee that great powers have been building great walls throughout history the great wall of china and the berlin wall went up at considerable expense and treasure and ultimately failed to block or contain the forces they purported to obstruct mr flynn says that efforts by the united states to protect the southwest border including installing a fence between san diego and tijuana are similarly fated to fail it is clear that this is not a good bill and we are

of congress to say that his district is not in need of something but if we all said all right we are just going to get it all get it all for our districts circumvent the authorization appropriation oversight function that congress has always had and simply say we are going to earmark it and use kind of a spoil system as to who gets the earmarks then it is simply going to drain the treasury and it is not fair to anyone i have universities in my district many of them compete for educational grants for research grants for other grants that are typically available in this appropriation bill and others that are being depleted those accounts for research funds are being depleted by earmarks later today i believe we will be voting on an amendment or some clarification of the tealu bill to replenish a research account or some kind of research account on roads whose account was depleted because of earmarks so people in arizona or elsewhere are not going to receive the funding that would come by formula back to them because of the gas taxes they paid in because of all of the earmarking that is going on so this is a problem it isonot a fair system it is not a transparent system if it were a transparent system we would have names next to the earmarks when they come to the floor we would have the ability to challenge it at any step you would have language that is such that a
