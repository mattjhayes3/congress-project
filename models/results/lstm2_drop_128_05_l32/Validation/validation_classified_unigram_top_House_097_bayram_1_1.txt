because i share his concern that the proposed metropolitan washington airports policy will have a substantial adverse effect on competition in the airline industry and on airline services and fares let me start with a brief discussion with the environmental issue i think the opponents of this amendment simply have to face up to the fact that the supplemental environmental impact statement prepared to accompany the policy and prepared by dot which is proposing this policy specifically admits that elimination of the atc authority that is the authority to fly when the air controllers say they have some space will produce and i quote no significant change in contour areas or population impacted upon implementation so the suggestion that this policy is going to be some sort of panacea for people in the national airport flight path i think has been knocked into a cocked hat by dots own admission i think the basic question we get to is whether we really believe in the deregulation policies that this congress and this administration have enunciated as our basis policy for the airways i would submit to the house that the proposed regulations are basically anticompetitive and in violation of the free competition policy and that they therefore fly in the face of what this congress has chosen to do by way of regulation of the airline industry i would also point out that the department of transportation has p roposed this policy without knowing the economic impact so that the department itself has to admit that it simply has not done the homework on what the competitive impacts of this policy would be now why do i say that the impacts are anticompetitive that is because the policy very plainly favors one type of air service over other competitive types of air service the fact of the matter is this policy says if you have a shuttletype service and you run extra sections in order to take care of the additional crowds that show up at the gates that extra section does not count against the number of slots you get under this policy so a shuttletype operatorand we know there is basically one using this airportis free to have all of the extra sections that the traffic will generate and this policy says go ahead and do it create all of the noise you want with your extra sections we are favoring that kind of operation but to someone who wants to compete with the shuttletype of operation by offering a different type of service a scheduled service and wants to use the socalled atc space that is availableand it generally can be used to run a scheduled type of service a competitive service that operates a different way with advance regulationsthis policy says we are going to throw every roadblock we can in your way because we are not going to allow you to have those atc slots even though your opposition your competitor can have all of the space they need for the extra traffic and we wll not count that against them i say that that is basically anticompetitive it is no place for the department of transportation to be overriding what congress has done and saying we are going to favor one type of service over a competitive type mr green i am very much aware of service of this new service tzhat is basically what we in con mr wilson and soon to be made gress have to face today the depart available to chicago in all probability ment of transportation has admitted mr green yes and i would again in its environmental impact statement emphasize the enormous savings to that this is not going to solve the noise the government from having a govproblem at national but it is going to erment travel rate on these flights as have a major competitive impact a result of the introduction of compemany of the smaller airlines which tition it is an enormous savings for have begun operating since we voted the government in favor of deregulation are going to mr wilson is the gentleman furbe put out of business or badly throt ther aware that if the amendment tled back if this policy is allowed to does not pass almost half of the air take effect traffic at the national airport will be i1 urge all of you to support the one airline policy of competition in the air lanes mr green i was not aware of the we voted for that i think this admin exact statistics but it is plain that if istration in general has been dedi one airline is allowed to have all of the cated to the competitive approach extra sections and the others are not today we have a chance to put up or the airline with extra sections could shut up on competition and i urge

the authorizations for fiscal year 1982 with those contained in the reagan administration budget and also to make significant changes in the interstate highway program the interstate changes were intended to redefine interstate completion in terms more realistically achievable by shifting the emphasis on our interstate program from the new construction mode to one of maintaining our investment in a 42 500mile network i am sure i do not have to remind anyone in this chamber that because of our economic crisis it has been necessary to further reduce spending for fiscal year 1982 the amendment we have before us will achieve our highway objectives toward those highway budget reductions the obligation limitation for the federalaid highway system for fiscal year 1982 is set at 8 billion 200 million below the level set in the original house passed h r 3210 as well as in the budget reconciliation act while i know a number of you would have of interstate completion would be eligible under the expanded interstate 3r4r program the reduction in the interstate completion category corresponds directly with the expanded interstate 3r4r program this newly defined category will fund projects for interstate resurfacing restoring rehabilitation and reconstruction work items no longer eligible for funding under the interstate completion category will be eligible for funding under the interstate 4r1 category the federal share for both interstate construction and interstate 4r1 will be 90 percent the redefinition of interstate cornpletion and the new 4r1 program closely parallel the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania during the markup of h r 3210 before the subcommittee on surface transportation last may the ranking minority member of the subcommittee deserves our recognition and commendation for the lead role he exercised in promoting a redefinition of the interstate program this year his efforts are chiefly responsible for transforming a simple 1year authorization bill into a significant piece of legislation the combined funding level for the interstate programs has been increased for fiscal year 1982 from 3 6 billion to 4 025 billion in addition the interstate 411 category has been authorized for a second year at a level of 800 million during the floor debate on h r 3210 this past september several members expressed concern about the proposed elimination of the half percent minimum setaside for smaller states the amendment under consideration retains the provision guaranteeing that every state will receive at least onehalt of 1 percent of the interstate of the interstate construction funds as was pointed out by our colleagues from delaware vermont new hampshire north dakota south dakota maine nebraska and wyoming the elimination of the half per cent minimum would have denied these states more than half of the interstate money they had been receiving and for which they were preferred to be rising in support of a multiyear highway bill a position taken by our senate colleagues i believe a consensus has been reached supportive of at least immediate needs of our nations highway program by reducing costs to complete the interstate system to a more achievable objective and by expanding our interstate restoration efforts to help begin the task of insuring that our nations most costly transportation investment is adequately protected even the staunchest supporters of multiyear legislation agree that it is better to make the changes in the definition of interstate completion and begin the interstate 4r1 program than to allow projects to be obligated during fiscal year 1982 that would be ineligible under the new defi nition this amendment to h r 3210 satisfies those objectives this amendment represents a true compromise witoi regard to the interstate highway system components both this chamber and the senate redefine interstate completion to reduce the costtocomplete estimate by some 15 to 17 billion while both the senate and house versions were similar certain elements of the interstate program would have been eligible under one version but not the other in an effort to resolve these differences the two redefinitions have been merged to insure that any project eligible under one of the redefinitions would still be eligible under the redefinition contained in this amendment this merging has been completed and the result is a cost estimate reduced from more than 53 billion to one in the range of 38 billion the new interstate completion definition would permit up to six lanes per designated interstate highway in rural areas and urban areas up to 400 000 population and up to eight lanes per designated interstate highways in areas of 400 000 population and above those lane limitations would not include high occupancy vehicle lanes the thrust behind the new definition would be to make interstate construction funds available only to construct interstate segments to a minimum level of acceptable service consisting of full access control and a pavement assigned to accommodate traffic anticipated for the next 20 years work no longer fundable under the redefinition planning for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 and these reductions in interstate construction funds would not have been offset by increases and interstate 4r1 funds under our original bill in several instances these states have completed their interstate systems and have major interstate restoration needs the amendment under consideration cures that defect also included in our amendment is a provision which will provide full federal funding for rebuilding the woodrow wilson bridge that carries interstate 95 over the potomac river during the floor debate on h r 3210 our colleagues mrs halt of maryland and mr wolf and mr paris of virginia ably described the exigent circumstances that existed on this federallyowned bridge on the interstate highway system the provision in this amendment would permit federal interstate funds to be expended to rehabilitate the bridge at its current lane capacity by the federal government however to insure that appropriate agreements are reached between the three jurisdictions that most significantly benefit from the woodrow wilson bridge namely the commonwealth of virginia the district of columbia and the state of maryland no moneys may be obligated until the secretary of transportation is assured that the three jurisdictions have executed agreements to insure the bridges continued viability we would strongly urge the secretary to encourage the three jurisdictions to expeditiously reach an agreement for the transfer of ownership away from the federal government i would like to take this opportunity to commend governor dalton from the commonwealth of virginia and governor hughes from the state of maryland for calling this serious problem to the attention of the congress and for their outstanding leadership in the area of transportation in addition to the interstate changes the amendment to h r 3210 contains a few other significant provisions a section has been included which gives the secretary of transportation the needed authority to waive technical compliance with federal requirements in the acquistion of certain real property in connection with the highway project in santa rosa calif under this provision the state of california would be permitted to use a portion of its federalaid apportionment to reimburse the city of santa rosa for costs already incurred by the city in connection with the federalaid project which meets federal standards this provision rights a misunderstanding that has existed for several years and does not involve any additional money to be expended from the federalaid highway system i have had conversations with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on surface transportation the gentleman from pennsylvania mr shusm and agree with him that the interstate redefinition changes and projects of national significance are too important not to resolve immediately and therefore cannot be delayed until we take up multiyear highway legislation during the next session however i want the gentleman from pennsylvania to know that i share his concern that funds may not currently be distributed in a way to direct dollars to where they are most needed or could be most effectively used in maintaining a national highway network i know the gentleman is examining new bases for distributig interstate 411 funds i will be most supportive of considering formula changes next year to achieve a more equitable distribution i am also aware of mr sinisters concerns about unitedstates route 522 in huntingdon county pa this situation sounds to me like the type of project that priority primary funds was intended to address i believe the designation of this project as a priority primary route should be given favorable consideration during our deliberations next session on multiyear highway legislation finally the amcndment to h r 3210 contains a provision of national significance n6t related to the interstatb highway system in the surface transportation act of 1978 we included a provision for the construction of a bypass highway that would reroute traffic around the redwood national park we thought at that time that we had provided both the necessary funds and authority to construct the project i would like to direct my colleagues attention to section 12 of the compromise bill this section deals with a matter which has been and continues to be of major iportance to the congress briefly stated section 12 does two things first subsection a of section 12 provides an additional authorization of 55 million for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million and second subsection b of section 12 assures that the redwood bypass highway project will provide the economic stimulus and the infrastructure improvement which congress intended to help offset at least partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park as i am sure my colleagues remember in enacting section 152 of the federalaid highway act of 1978 and section 101 a 5 of the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 congress provided for the construction of a bypass highway around the redwood national park in order to divert motor vehicle traffic around the park so as to best serve the needs of the traveling public while preserving the natural beauty of the park the congress regarded this project as unique a fact clearly reflected in the priority treatment accorded the project in the federalaid highway act of 1978 and the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 this priority reflects the need for the project long recognized by the congress in terms of mobility and safety for the traveling public access to the park preservation of its environmental values and both economic stimulus and infrastructure improvement to help offset partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park section 12 of the compromise bill before us today addresses two problems which have arisen since the project was authorized in 1978 the first problem deals with the cost of the project the california department of transportation has estimated that the construction costs of the preferred alternative taking into account inflation would be 102 million in 1986 costs since congress authorized only 50 million in the federalaid highway act of 1978 an additional autborization is necessary in order to remedy this situation subsection a of section 12 of the compromise bill authorizes an additional 55 million~ in contract authority for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million this amount should be sufficient to cover the federal share of the entire cost of the project"], [0.9990055017406121, 0.0009944982593879104, 1, "this bill will soon come up for a vote and indeed it should i do not think there ought to be any illusions about

prohibit the use of master meters for gas and electricity supplied to new buildings which have more than one unit passage of this bill would cut back on the considerable amount of energy currently wasted in apartments and commercial buildings with master metering as we all realize the need for our nation to save energy is absolutely essential our reliance on imported oil makes us politically and militarily vulnerable and causes severe economic problems that contribute to unemployment inflation the deflated value of the dollar and our balanceofpayknents deficit in our efforts to cut back on our use of imported oil we have greatly neglected one abundant source of energyconservation conservation is our cheapest cleanest and most readily available energy alternative and conservation does not have to mean undue sacrificerecent studies show that the united states can use 3040 percent less energy than it now does with no reduction in our standard of living conservation is thus the equivalent of an alternative energy source it is far cheaper and easier to save a barrel of oil than to produce or import one at the present time~the gas and electricity usage of the majority of tenants in the united states is metered at a single point for an entire building when such master metering rather than individual meteringis used tenants utility expenses are included in their total rent charges as a result individual tenants are not directly aware of the amount of their gas and electricity consumption and thus have no economic incentive to cut back on usage not surprisingly a tenant has a tendency to use less energy when hie has to pay directly for itas is the case when he receives a monthly utility bill that reflects his own individual consumption of energy the wasteful habits of tenants who receive their utility service by means of master metering liave long been recognized by both utility company personnel and apartment owners and managers this considerable and unnlecessary waste of energy was confirmed in a 1975 report prepared for the former federal energy administration after an extensive study of master metering of electrical service in apartment houses in 10 major cities the conclusion was reached that residential customers whose electrical service was provided through master meters consumed about 35 percent more electricity than those in similar apartments who received service through individual meters and who thus paid directly for the energy used had the customers with master meters used the same reducedi amount of energy as the individually metered customers they would have saved 7 billion k w hours in a yearthe equivalent l 13 million barrels of oil this bill calls forilndividual metering of gas as well as electricity so the savings would be even greater the evidence provided in the pfea study is supported by officials at the department of housing and urban development who state that a 35percent reduction in electricity use occurred in public housing projects when the projects were converted from master metering to individual metering in 1976 hud issued regulations which required the conversion of all public housing projects to individual metering where the conversion would be cost effective by november 1978 laws which restrict the use of master meters in multifamily dwellings haver been enacted in seven states california florida maryland minnesota north carolina oregon and texas none of the utility commise 400 sions in those seven states report any major problems with the implementation of such laws the feasibility of totally eliminating master metering from residential service has also been proven in chicago ill where a commonwealth edison co policy of refusing to serve new residential customers through master meters has been in effect for 25 years that policy has been successfully defended in the illinois courts and the company has established workable practices for the maintenance and servicing of their distribution systems in large buildings in most casea conserving energy by installing imdi al metering would not cause undue sacrifice for tenants or cramp their lifestyles a large proportion of the excess energy used in buildings with master metering occurs when airconditioning and heating units are left to operate at high levels while tenants are away from their apartments during the day or on vacations since 40 percent of the total housing stock that will be available in the united states by the year 2000 will be built in the next 20 years truly significant energy savings could be made through more energyefficient building design requirements including individual utility metering we must use every reasonable means possible to reduce energy use starting

suit that it was improper to have them burning coal because as all of us know no matter what is put into an electric utilitywhether it be coal natural gas or oilwe only get half of the end product out

agriculture community truly agriculture is the heartbeat of america today we will vote on the reagan administrations proposal to delete the semiannual adjustment in the dairy price support program previous administrations both democratic and republican have done exactly this as a means of fine tuning the dairy price support program i will support this effort to reduce excess stocks of dairy products many of us however know that this bill is only a partial answer and alone will not solve the problem faced by dairy farmers livestock producers and grain farmers my preference has been to address the problem in a gradual and less disruptive manner i want to send the dairy farmer a signal that will assure a stable supply of milk this bill when coupled with the administrations failure to submit in a timely fashion an overall dairy program proposal for the 1981 farm bill does not send that signal to the american farm community nor to consumers in committee i supported an outright floor of 75 percent because without the april 1 adjustment by september parity will be less than 70 percent obviously such a turn of events will lead to small and midsize dairy farmers going out of business a floor of 75 percent of parity coupled with a sellback provision of 110 percent for ccc stocksan increase of only 5 percentwould not allow these bankruptcies to occur it he so chose the secretary of agriculture could increase the sellback provision to 110 percent now further i am concerned that members understand that by this vote we are not taking the first step toward throwing out the baby with the bathwater the dairy price support program must remain an integral part of the 1981 farm bill the dairy price support program works over its lifetime it has provided reasonable returns to the producers and it has assured consumers of an adequate supply of pure and wholesome nlilk and dairy products we must all remember that this program is meeting the goals of those who wrote this legislation in 1949 in terms of the overall federal budget this program has cost very little in fact when one looks at the cost to the american consumer in real terms these basic foodstuffs are lower in cost than they were when the program began in terms of farm productivity in 1950 per cow milk production averaged 5 314 pounds and today average production per cow amounts to 11 875 pounds this program has helped the farmer double his prodnetivity and when this fact is coupled with the reduced amount of hours worked by americans it shows that consumers buy more with less farm productivity has been passed on to the consumer thirty years ago 16 minutes of work earned enough money to buy onehalf gallon of milktoday less than 9 minutes of work are required to buy the same item yes the program does work and we are all the beneficiaries of it once again i want to remind you that while we will vote to reduce ccc stocks today this action alone will not eliminate the problem this action is intended to cure todays action is temporary and the longterm solution can only be addressed in the upcoming farm bill in that bill we must address the impact that low grain and beef prices have on overproduction of milk and the accompanying buildup in dairy herds before this year is out you will be asked to again vote on the health of the american dairy farmer and by extension the american agriculture community at that time i hope all of us will be able to support continuation of a dairy price support program at no less than 75 percent of parity and a stronger grain support section of that legislation increasing the sell back provision to 110 percent increasing grain and beef prices will more than this bill or any other action insure against continued overproduction of milk and

are trying to scuttle the presidents program and of course trying to scuttle it without scuttling themselves in the process there is a saying around this town dont listen to their wordswatch their hands well the hands of the majority leadership are on the lever that controls the starting gate they are trying awfully hard to keep that gate closed so the president will not even be given a chance to get on the track fortunately the president has been willing to compromise he has accepted a bipartisan substitute i was quite surprised to h~ear my good friend and he is my good friend and my dear friend from michigan a few moments ago belittling the important of his demhocratic colleagues who are considering supporting the lattagramim bipartisan compromise in fact this is not even sectional support because i have read several accounts of northern democrats as well as southern democrats who are we were faced and are faced regulargoing to support this bipartisan corn ly with the choice of whether we want promise it seems to me that rather some kind of a guaranteed income prothan belittling those democrats who gram or whether we want to have a are willing to give the president a jobs program in this nation any time chance i say we should salute them you ask any public opinion group on indcd i believe the american people that question they say we do not will salute them for setting partisan want the guaranteed income program ship aside and supporting the presi we want a jobs program and yet dent who was overwhemingly elected what the administration has come up by the american people withit does not call it this but it is a so the issue is will guaranteed income program the president be given a chance this we have a choice of paying people is the first test this is the

amendment and urge my colleagues to support it we have an opportunity here to transfer funds to the coast guards seemingly always shortchanged operations account it is my understanding that fewer personnel retired than were anticipated in addition lower colas based on lower inflation rates have made funds available which otherwise would not be to this extent and to the extent that we continue to expect the coast guard to perform at the optimum levels i think we should agree to this amendment as i have said in the past it is the congress which has put numerous responsibilities on the shoulders of the coast guard and it is the congress which is always ready to criticize when the coast ouard appears to be performing at less than expected to those of my colleagues who do jump to criticize this is a chance for you to help assure that the coast guard continues to render the level of service we expect by voting for this amendment you will be voting to transfer funds to the

10year extension of the gateway national recreation area advisory commission a similar measure to convey rights to the described methane gas was introduced by jonathan bingham on april 1 1982 a measure to extend the life of the gateway national recreation area advisory commission was introduced by mr bingham and was passed by the house of representatives on march 23 1982 s 2218 was passed by the senate and referred to the house of representatives on june 14 1982 and was considered by the subcommittee on public lands and national parks on july 22 1982 and ordered reported without an amendment by the committee on interior and insular affairs on july 28 1982 gateway national recreation area was established in 1972 by public law 92592 new york city deeded the fountain avenue landfill to the national park service in 1974 for inclusion in gateway national recreation area the city retained a right to use the landfill until december 31 1985 the 360plusacre landfill located in the jamacia unit of the park is known to be generating methane gas in amounts that if extracted are commercially attractive the city of new york is currently developing a comprehensive methane recovery program in the city and would like to include the fountain avenue landfill in its program the surface area of the landfill is in its present state not usable for recreation as methane gas leakage and present uses preclude using the area for public access the city of new york desires to contract with a private corporation to recover and process the methane they estimate the methane recovery program would last a minimum of 20 years and produce a gross annual revenue price of methane at the well head of 1 207 500 to 3 365 000 depending upon the quality of the gas the city estimates proceeds of the sale of methane that will be returned to the city will amount to about 121 percent of the gross value or 150 000 to 420 000 annually of which half will be shared with the

in lesser developed countries at a time when american agrieulture is devastated by high interest rates depressed prices and sluggish export markets this grant adds insult to the injury already done to the american farmer the administration and certain of my colleagues tell american farmers that they must learn to survive in the free market and to make up domestic deficits through increased exports this position is undermined by the fact that the federal government uses ineffective agricultural embargoes in the place of legitimate foreign policy by the fact that other nations subsidize their exports heavily and by the fact that the weak world economy makes export growth unlikely for the next several crop years as american farmers fight to break even under these economic hardships they are told that their government lacks the resources to help maintain market stability for domestically produced commodities what must they think when that same government has the resources to squander almost 10 million to develop foreign competition for american exports i am glad to say that i voted against both the authorization and appropriations legislation under which this grant was made and that i will continue to oppose legislation aimed at solving the problems of other nations so long as americas rural economy remains depressed so long as america is inadequately defended and so long as
