debt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el

esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el

house of representatives for a great american tradition the state of the unionthe presidential address where we celebrate openness and transparency in our government where a vision is laid out that we are free to disagree with or agree with components of but nonetheless points to this great american ideal that we are a people who selfgovern and that we are accountable in an open way to the people who sent us here even in the midst of deep philosophical divides about the direction of our nationand of course the world was watching i believe it is important though that we take a moment of reflection and be honest about this moment in time and the current conditions in our society many americans do face downward mobility stagnant wages and an increased cost of living many people feel very abandoned in the face of a washingtonwall street axis where more and more power is concentrated into fewer and fewer hands but i think we have to be careful about something we have to be careful about seeing the solution as lying in more government i think our nation deserves a smart and effective government and i think our job here in congress is to continue in an open way look at the past and see what worked and see what doesnt work to let go of that which is tired and old and worn out and continues to linger and to invest more in that which is smart and effective and can truly build a good society that creates opportunity for all i also believe that we shouldnt divide ourselves by class and income and that in a healthy economy it is one that is focused on small business this is where most new jobs are created in our country particularly for young people i think we need to create a culture of creativity one in which a person who has an idea can seize the moment and use the gifts of their own two hands and their own intellect to make good things to create benefit for others to create jobs hire people protect families and to make a contribution to society many young people want to pursue these avenues yet we have to be honest about what is happening we are entering in this country into an entrepreneurial winter what does that mean in other words the number of startup businessessmall businessesis less than the number of small businesses dying we do not have a net increase in the number of small businesses and again this is where most americans live and work making good things for others in small business that is where jobs are created how do we address this problem well the tendency again in our body is to think about public solutions but lets examinenot through my opinion but just the analyticsas to why small businesses are not creating new jobs and are not starting up as aggressively as they have in the past it is really two things it is health care and regulations smart regulations are necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of all americans but when you have oppressive regulations that tend to stack the deck toward those who are larger and can hire an army of lawyers and accountants it represses the ability of small businesses to take risks and create jobs the second problem we have is health care i got an email yesterday from someone who said congressman my health care has gone up so much that i have to move into government housing now think of the irony of that again we need the right type of health care reform one that is going to reduce costs and improve health care outcomes while we protect vulnerable persons but what has happened some people have been helped by the new law but many many families have been hurt with escalating health care costs and again it creates an environment in which small business is repressed again i think our government should be smart and effective and i think that is what most americans want but washington continues to remain mired in mediocrity and political dysfunction and partisan gridlock have made smart and proper government difficult this arthritic recovery has dimmed the financial prospects of too many individuals who again have stagnant wages or who have given up hope and feel directionless isolated and alone we can do better and we must do better despite these challenges i believe the start of a new congress is an exciting time to renew our government and this promise of our nation i would like to say this mr speaker there is nothing wrong in america that

order to enjoy our personal freedom americans need access to credit as individuals on behalf of their families and in their businesses that is why i am so proud to have introduced this bill h r 3791 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and loan companies get access to the capital they need so as to make credit available in their communities these small banking institutions are critical to the people and the communities in which they reside they support the credit needs of families of small businesses of farmers and of entrepreneurs a community bank is often the principal lending source for many people whether they are purchasing a home starting a new business or purchasing a vehicle in many counties around the nation a community bank is the only banking presence that residents have when these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with regulations and mandates many of which are meant for larger institutions it is the hardworking middleincome and lowincome families in those communities who suffer the most it is about people community banks give people the credit they need to pursue their dreamsto buy a home to start a business in fact proximity to a community bank increases the chances that new small businesses will be approved for loans and will have the chance to succeed by raising the consolidated asset threshold under the federal reserves small bank holding company policy statement from 1 billion to 5 billion in assets over 400 additional small bank and thrift holding companies will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and therefore will be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines these capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation just when regulators are demanding higher capital levels these exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt this bill is about making sure regulations fit the size of the institution a similar effort was passed into law during the last congress under suspension in the house and by unanimous consent in the senate that bill raised the threshold from 500 million where it has been since 1996 to 1 billion that legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan holding companies while we are glad that we were able to achieve that increase which helped roughly 500 small bank and thrift holding companies we would like to extend those benefits further h r 3791 would bring more than 400 additional small institutions within the scope of the policy statement one success story that we have already seen from the previous increase was an instance in which 35 bank holding companies pooled their resources to issue debt under the policy statement that debt was then downstreamed to the respective banks where the capital was then used to make loans in the communities they serve illustrating the great multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce h r 3791 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and the communities they serve opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory threshold would put communities and the deposit insurance fund at higher risk but the policy statement contains several safeguards that are designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks to sum this up this bill is not about supporting banks it is about supporting families communities and small businesses it is about making sure that a smallbusiness owner like my constituent jennifer jones has access to the credit she needs to expand her early childhood academy where she teaches children to read before they reach kindergarten it is about families who are sitting around their kitchen tables and are imagining the possibilities of renovating or of improving their homes it is about that entrepreneur who is starting a restaurant and being her own boss it is about the thousands of new jobs that will be created in those communities as a

and nancy raised three children ann fedders of new richmond sidney scott of fall city and paul barkla jr of ellsworth he was very proud of his 12 grandchildren and six greatgrandchildren paul believed in our democratic process and public service that is why he ran for and was elected to the pierce county board in 2004 and later became the board chair pierce county residents knew paul as a community leader and advocate for the needs of his neighbors he wasnt afraid to tackle tough issues he told me he enjoyed serving on the county board because it was less partisan driven more by the local needs of the pierce county residents rather than strict adherence to party ideology although paul was gruff on the outside he was fiercely loyal to his family and friends we had many discussions over the years i knew i could always count on paul to provide an honest opinion and he was never afraid to speak his mind he made many friends over the years through politics and public service he befriended many of my staff whom he talked to frequently and stayed in touch with even when they moved on to other opportunities for those who are lucky enough to cross paths with paul from folks in washington to oregon to washington d c he will not be forgotten paul exemplified what was great about america deep love for his country the importance of public service and the need to fight for the most

conversation each and every time was the fact that the recipient of that bonusthis individualactually puts that on their tax return and pays it at a much higher rate in fact that 1 million would probably be taxed at the 43 percent rateor 39 6 plus the addons that are in place so over and over again yesterday the american people were misled as to the consequences of getting bonuses or paying chief executive officers it does not go untaxed simply because the company gets a tax deduction that employee has to put that on their tax return and pay the appropriate taxes on that i just wanted to

want to thank my outstanding colleague from new jersey congressman chris smith for introducing this important piece of legislation and for the work he has done for so many years on this issue this bill will elevate the office to monitor and combat trafficking to the status of a bureau within the state department put simply human trafficking is slavery victims of human trafficking are deprived of their individual freedoms and suffer unimaginably harsh coercive and heartbreaking conditions reports indicate that there is no place in the world where children women and men are safe from human trafficking that means that every government in the world has a responsibility to combat this problem the united states has made significant progress toward responding to these crimes within our borders and abroad since congress passed the trafficking victims protection act in 2000 today we can take the next step forward by elevating the state departments office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons to a bureau this office is already doing incredible work the annual trafficking in persons report has become the global gold standard in assessing how well governments around the world are meeting this challenge and how serious they take their responsibility to eradicate this horrific practice their work is forging partnerships and driving innovation on how best to approach this problem and the office plays a key role in coordinating our wholeofgovernment approach to this problem elevating the trafficking office to a bureau sends a strong message to the world that the united states remains committed to combating modernday slavery passing this legislation alone will not end this despicable practice and it is not a problem that we will solve quickly or

us will require the director of the office of management and budget to consult with gao to develop antifraud guidance for federal agencies and then monitor the implementation of this guidance the bill
