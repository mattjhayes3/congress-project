help strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two countries during our time there we met with top brazilian negotiators to discuss key trade issues that we expect will be addressed next week

doubt the unitedstates employers rely on these laws which serve as a fundamental line of defense an opportunity to police our markets against unfair trade and to preserve domestic industries that otherwise would be at risk there is no question that it is the responsibility of congress and the administration to ensure that our firms have the proper tools to fight illegally traded goods and services while we are committed to opening our markets and have done so historically reducing tradedistorting subsidies and eliminating nontariff barriers to trade we are not willing to give up appropriate tools that we have to police our market for illegally traded imports to reinforce this i introduced a resolution h res 577 calling on unitedstates negotiators to stand firm in the face of international pressure and uphold our trade remedy laws during the wtos doha development agenda round many in the doha round particularly the socalled friends of antidumping negotiations have targeted unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty measures as distortions to trade they claim they are antifree trade and yet the fact remains that our participation in a free trading system is contingent on our ability to have access to these remedies these laws as i said are the last line of defense and eliminating or weakening them is not a solution to making sure that they work appropriately nor is in this political climate in congress weakening or watering down the ability of the unitedstates to utilize its appropriate trade remedy laws in any way a viable position the time

control out of the boise tower but we also have the national interagency fire center which attacks the wildfires on blm and forest service ground all over the west and finally i would say this is such

general concems that i think speak to why it is important to support the amendment offered by mr hastings poor cost analysis limited savings the faa has only been able to show negligible savings with the proposed collocation after two meetings and repeated requests for detailed cost informationto include shortterm expenses and savings as well as longterm projected costs etc on april 27 my delegation colleagues and i met with administrator blakey at which time a rudimentary cost savings analysis was provided claiming only 2 47 million in savings over 25 yearsless than 100 000 per year more importantly by the faas own admission this analysis does not take into account all personnel costs such as the need to hire additional controllers due to loss of flexible scheduling dual training and other efficiencies currently used at the boise tower as well as other potential cost increases therefore the planned move will likely result in greater costs over that 25year pdriod poor planning

disappointment and flat disagreement with the department of defenses recommendation to close ellsworth air force base in south dakota as a part of the base realignment and closure commission this recommendation is as misguided as they come while the brac process is necessary to ensure that our armed forces can efficiently and adequately serve our military needs at home and abroad into the 21st century this decision does not accurately reflect the value of ellsworth to that cause as lead wing for the aerospace expeditionary force the 28th bomb wing at ellsworth air force base played a decisive role in operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom as they did in kosovo and afghanistan the b1 and her crews from ellsworth air force base performed superbly during operation iraqi freedom bis played a vital role in helping liberate iraq by dropping more than half the satelliteguided munitions ellsworth once again demonstrated that it is the backbone of americas bomber fleet and the base has fulfilled its missions admirably this is a modern wellequipped installation that has served our country for decades and is prepared to serve for decades to come ellsworth has substantially upgraded its infrastructure since the last round of base closures which will allow ellsworth to accept new missions and continue to grow rather than closing ellsworth is well situated to receive additional assignments in addition ellsworths geographic and strategic strengths are many located in western south dakota ellsworth is strategically positioned and is not threatened by urban encroachment or crowded air space major factors that have not been given appropriate weight by the department of defense in addition the base is close to bomber training facilities in the region i am also concerned the secretary of defense did not adequately consider the benefits of locating military bases in rural regions a disproportionate number of bases recommended for closure realignment resulting in a disproportionate number of lost jobs are in rural states such as alaska maine north dakota and south dakota this oversight is part and parcel of a continued disregard for not only the needs of rural america but the unique value and strengths rural america offers to our country as a whole additionally commencing a round of base closures during a time of war is questionable strategy and could be harmful to our national security the current round of domestic base closures should wait until after the department of defense completes its plans to bring troops back to the united states from overseas bases i am also concerned about the risks associated with consolidating all of our b1 bombers in a single location furthermore i am concerned that we are making base closure decisions prior to the quadrennial defense review for 2005 the quadrennial defense review analyzes force structure modernization plans military infrastructure and the defense budget to help establish a roadmap for defense programs it cannot be ignored before assessing base realignments and closures finally the economic impact of closing ellsworth air force base on south dakota would be dramatic our state would lose our second largest employer and an estimated 278 million a year the loss of nearly 4 000 jobs would set south dakota almost a year back in statewide job growth i have invited the chairman of the brac commission anthony principi and other members of the commission to visit ellsworth air force base and hold one of their regional field hearings in rapid city hone to ellsworth a visit to ellsworth will allow the commission the opportunity to see what those of us from south dakota already know the b1 bomber and ellsworth air force base are irreplaceable and crucial to our national security as the brac commission moves forward and reviews the department of defenses recommendations i am confident the brac commission will realize the department of defense deviated substantially from their established base closure criteria when recommending ellsworth for closure and will support removing it from the list"], [0.9678415469825268, 0.03215845301747322, 1, "i rise

and rich history and as one of my hawais 742 000 credit union members h r 749 will allow credit unions to provide expanded services to both members and nonmembers otherwise eligible for membership these expanded services include the issuance of travelers checks and money orders and electronic funds transfers most specifically this bill if signed into law will in part enable many more of our citizens to transfer money overseas to family members and others with greater ease thereby assisting our personal and financial interests for it is a fact that our country is facing its highest level of immigration since the depression era with over 28 4 million foreignbom individuals residing in the united states my hawaii is no exception according to the most recent census bureaus american community survey hawaii with 17 9 percent has the fourthlargest percentage of foreignborn residents in the united states an overwhelming majority of hawaiis foreignborn population is from asia according to the susannah wesley community center a private nonprofit agency contracted by the state of hawaii to provide immigrant services hawaiis largest immigrant populationfifty percent of all incoming immigrantshails from the philippines it is crucial to these populations and others that our financial institutions provide quick efficient and economical means by which monies may be transferred to their countries of origin and elsewhere unfortunately our nations financial infrastructure has been slow to offer such services especially in the less urbanized and rural parts of our country such as my district where our credit unions have long filled an important communitybased financial services function asa result there is a growing population of unbanked individuals particularly immigrants and a costly and inefficient money transfer process the world council of credit unions along with the credit union national association offer credit unions a remittance product called the international remittance network irnet irnet is an electrohic funds transfer service providing credit union members a safe and inexpensive way to send money overseas and domestically and provides service to over 40 countries in latin america asia africa and europe including the philippines mexico and australia irnet significantly decreases the costs for individuals to transfer funds overseas over the past four years the advent of irnet and enhanced competition among our financial institutions offering money transfer services has driven down remittance costs for consumers the average cost today of sending 300 to mexico is between 13 and 14 or 45 percent of the amount sent compared to the average cost four years ago which was between 30 and 32 or 1011 percent this legislation will expand the range and number of people eligible for the use of irnet and thereby lower the costs paid by the consumer for these services through increased competition within the marketplace in the process it will also encourage a larger number of our newlyarrived citizens and residents to utilize our credit unions and other financial services h r 749 will not harm or otherwise risk our countrys financial or monetary security as irnet utilizes realtime monitoring of transactions against the specially designated names sdn list from the office of foreign asset

to say it over and over again because that is how you get the word out i can speak from personal experiences that ipf is a serious lung disorder many may not know it but ipf is the most common form of interstitial lung disease i guarantee you most of us do not know that idiopathic and i have been asked this 1 000 times means that there is no known cause it is hard to cure something when you do not know what caused it pulmonary fibrosis has no cure or treatment however i wouldsay to my friend the gentleman from ohio having a new lung certainly extends ones lifetime and i am going to be here to argue with him a lot longer than the statistics say so do not give up i am going to be with you awhile with this disease a persons ability to breathe becomes increasingly restricted and it is painful and eventually of course it results in death as we review the legislation today and as we think about what we are actually asking to be done i want us to remember there are 83 000 americans today right now that are facing this painful reality of ipf and they all cannot get a lung i was blessed to have one but not everybody can unfortunately an unknown number above and beyond those 83 000 americans succumb to its fatal outbome without even knowing they have had ipf there is little awareness of ipf and it is often missed or underdiagnosed in this nation as the gentleman from georgia pointed out it is true in fact a recent study found that ipf may be five to ten times more prevalent than we previously thought it is unknown whether this increase is due to an actual spike in the occurrence of the disease or simply a previous lack of definite guidelines for diagnosing ipf even those who are properly and quickly diagnosed as i was fortunate enough to be must face the facts that the medium survival rate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients is 2 to 3 years i would say to the gentleman from ohio do not count on that i have a new lung i am going to be around a lot longer than that about twothirds of the ipf patients die within 5 years of developing the disease i am not going to do that i was blessed to have a new lung furthermore knowledge of this disease is hindered by very low public awareness awareness that is alarmingly low when compared to other less prevalent diseases a recent poll indicates only 29 percent of americans know the first thing about ipf half of

in this bill on renewable energy let me tell you why this is so critical this year the department of defense will spend 10 billion on its basic energy bill of that 10 billion 4 7 billion will buy one thing fuel for the air force planes that 4 7 billion is about what we are going to spend for the national cancer institute we need renewable energies not just for our environment not just to bring gas

press releases patting ourselves on the back for this sweeping new investment in renewable energy those press releases promised 3 3 billion would be spent on renewable energies this year alone 3 3 billion authorized for research development and deployment of renewable energy but when it comes time to actually sign the check the check doesnt say 3 3 billion it says 1 3 billion that is 2 billion

the argument can be made and i respect the argument that many renewable technologies did receive increases over last year many specific accounts for renewable energy research and development did receive increases over last years levels but only in washington can a 2 billion shortfall be called an increase try that logic with your utility company when the bill comes try saying i know i was going to pay 100 150 but what i really meant to say was i am giving you 15 no utility company would let you get away with it and the congress shouldnt allow that to be gotten away with the bottom line

here i think we have a moral obligation to our children that can be easily summarized number one protect them from harm and that is what governments at all levels do try to do and that is what a lot of social service agencies try to do protect our children from harm number two we need to give them a healthy start in life we have to provide them with quality health care number three we have to create bpportunity for them and that means investing in education giving them a chance to succeed in fife so as i said before 36 billion more is what the republicans in the house want to spend on interest on the national debt but they are cutting the maternal and child health block grant by 24 million or 3 percent they are failing to raise the maximum pell grant by even 100 they are doing that by only 50 the bill is making a 5 percent cut in the healthy start initiative which makes targeted grants to improve prenatal and infant care in areas with high infant mortality rates so in those areas with high infant mortality rates we are just saying we are going to take money away from those parents and their kids we are going to take it away because we have to pay interest on the national debt they are freezing money for the child care block grant at last years level they are freezing afterschool health care funds it goes on and on it is just an abomination to do what we are doing in this budget to our children cutting their health care funds decreasing opportunity simply so we can pay for tax cuts and a war in iraq is beyond belief and we need to reverse it i want to thank the gentleman for yielding to me i want to thank the gentleman from virginia for letting me go at this moment in the proceeding and i am very grateful for all the work the gentleman from south carolina is doing"]]}
