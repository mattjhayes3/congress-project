war ii particularly recognizing the significant changes in the lives of women and minorities that occurred during that era i am very pleased by the wide support this legislation has received not only in our home community of richmond california but from groups like kaiser permanente and the veterans of foreign wars i want to thank the gentleman from alaska and the gentleman from utah for their

which marks the 55th anniversary of the end of that horrific conflict just last month the dday museum was opened in new orleans with a great deal of attention paid to the critical role in the successful invasion of the higgins boat and those who manufactured it h r 4063 allows this nation to honor permanently through the creation of a national historic park all of the millions of women and minorities in particular who were the forgotten soldiers of world war ii those who made enormous contributions to this nation during world war ii on the home front their migration to industrial centers like richmond california and their ability to move into jobs formerly held only by white males who had moved into the armed forces changed the course of the war the course of history and the course of social and economic policies in this country forever it should be noted that thousands of them gave their lives as part of the war effort i would like to note that in the report from the national park service they note that between pearl harbor in 1941 and january of 1944 that 37 000 people lost their lives on the home front working to build the military mechanism that we used to defeat the axis that over 4 million people were temporarily disabled and 210 000 people were permanently disabled so in fact the war the war that world war ii was creating was creating the casualties also on the home front for those who responded to the national need rosie the riveter has survived as the most remembered icon of the civilian workforce that helped win world war h and had a powerful resonance in the womens movement the national park service tells us in their feasibility study the national park service also found that the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park is nationally significant and that richmond offers an exceptional opportunity to interpret the many layers of world war ii home front experience including migration and resettlement for jobs integration of the workforce industrial and employee service innovations and the remarkable effort by government industry communities and unions to enable america to win the war at the hearing we held on this bill we heard from former rosies and wendy the welders through the moving testimony of ludie mitchell we heard what it was like for minority women to journey from the south to the west coast of the united states to areas that they had never been had never seen and had barely heard of to take up a welders torch to climb into the belly of a ship under construction and do their job and at one point complete the construction of that ship within 4 days we also heard from ruth powers who worked in the child care center which was necessitated by the construction schedule in the kaiser shipyards for 24hour child care in fact what we found in the discussions during the hearing was that today as we talk about the 24 and 7 economy the fact that dot coms and the new technology cause people to work around the clock with the globalization of the economy what in fact we find out that 24 and 7 existed long before that it existed in the home front battle in world war ii where we had 24hour child care 24hour food service 24hour health care movie shows ran 24hour schedules and in many instances boarding houses ran 24hour schedules because one shift would sleep while the other shift was working and then the others would come in so that there would be enough housing for all of the workers who migrated to the west coast shipyards in richmond california what this legislation is really about is about a celebration of the american spirit it is about a celebration of americans ability to sacrifice it is about a celebration of americans responding to the call of the country to the national need and responding to problems in other parts of the world because that is what america did in the home front during world war ii america responded with every being in the country to contribute to that effort as white america white male america went off to the war quickly the roosevelt administration found itself with the inability to conduct that war because america was not prepared for that war so some 10 million people went off to military service that meant that somebody else was going to have to take the jobs in the shipyards and the tank manufacturing facilities and all of the war material plants across this country that fell to rosie the riveter and to minority workers who were not allowed at that time to join the battle front they had to stay on the home front and respond they did in my hometown of richmond california a sleepy westeri town on the edge of san francisco bay it went from 23 000 people to over 90 000 people in a matter of months as henry kaiser responded to the call of president roosevelt to create the infrastructure to build the ships in the 1930s i think i am correct america launched about 30 ships in the 1940s very few until the war started in this shipyard we built over 747 ships and at one point in the historical report they tell us the robert e perry liberty ship was constructed in richmond shipyard number 2 in 4 days 15 hours and 29 minutes and it was ready to go battle overseas in 4 days 15 hours the shipyard workers constructed a liberty ship that is one of the remarkable efforts that is celebrated by this legislation and would be celebrated by the rosie the riveter park it is also celebrated as the integration of the workforce for the first time out of the south blacks and whites were forced to work together if in fact we were going to defeat our enemies in world war ii so in this case not only was the workforce becoming more female it was becoming integrated again that changed the social dynamics not only of our civilian structure where people were living in the same housing there was no time to segregate them it was too expensive people came together in integration in the workplace in child care centers and health care facilities and in housing but eventually it also changed to the integration of the armed services in responding to this but it was not just the rosie the riveters and the welders responding and sacrificing and responding to the call of president roosevelt and the needs of our nation other americans were doing the same thing those of that generation will remember the efforts to ration gasoline to ration all the critical materials any metals rubber tires bicycles vacuum cleaners all of these things had to last they had to last longer than normal because we needed the materials for the second world war i some people will remember the slogans use it all up dont waste it wear it out make it do or do without victory gardens cropped up all over the nation all part of the home front battle the effort of this legislation is to remember that and create a repository for so many of the artifacts that continue to exist to create oral histories of the women and the men and the minorities that worked in the shipyards and the home front effort a couple of years ago under the leadership of councilwoman donna powers we had a celebration in richmond california where to the best of our knowledge we tried to invite many the women who worked in the shipyards during world war h to come back and to participate in the celebration recognizing their contribution to the winning of world war ii the fact is that over 100 women came from all across the country with their daughters with their granddaughters in some cases granddaughters and daughters came because their mother or grandmother had passed on but they wanted to come see where their mother or grandmother or great grandmother worked and to participate in that piece of history hopefully the creation of this home front historic park will allow other families to participate in that historic journey on behalf of their families and the contributions that these women made to winning the war effort i would l4ope that the house would give its overwhelming support to this legislation so that we can follow up on the finding of value of this park by the national park service and we can pay proper tribute to all of those who participated in the battle for the home front i rise in support of h r 4063 which would create the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park by passing this bill

in the womens movement this legislation has been carefully developed by local officials and organizations in the richmond and east bay area in conjunction with the national parks service pursuant to legislation enacted by the last congress the bill is based on the feasibility study prepared pursuant to that legislation i would note that assistant secretary donald barry has stated the study found that the area proposed as the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park is nationally significant richmond offers an exceptional opportunity to interpret the many layers of world war ii home front experience including migration and resettlement for jobs integration of the workforce industrial and employee service innovations and the remarkable efforts by government industry

four days we also heard from ruth powers who worked in the child care center that was necessitated by the roundtheclock schedule of the kaiser shipyards in fact child care and group health pioneered by kaiser were among the most historic social developments to emerge from world war ii and at the rosie historic site we have original buildings from both we also have some of the remaining dry docks where the liberty and victory ships were constructed and some of the unique architecture that was transformed into war production facilities or built to accommodate defense needs the full story of the home fronts contributions and sacrifices during the war and richmonds particular contributions to that effort are outlined in the feasibility study at this point excerpts from rosie the riveter world war ii home front final feasibility study report national park service june 2000 in the first year of americas entry to world war ii the unitedstates navy was losing ships faster than they could be built in the 1930s america had launched only 23 ships in 1940 it took 14 months to build a typical cargo ship by 1945 it was being done in eight weeks four shipyards were built in rapid succession in richmond beginning in early 1941 and completed by 1942 employment at the richmond shipyards peaked at 90 000 and along with the rest of the defense industry buildup forced a national recruitment and migration of workers and integration of the work force that was unprecedented in its magnitude and impact as america went to war its people fought overseas on the battle fronts and pitched in on the home front ten million people departed the civilian workplace for active military service industry challenged to undertake a massive overnight buildup aggressively began recruiting and training an effective workforce from the population left behind rosie the riveter was a propaganda phrase coined to help recruit female civilian workers and came to symbolize a workface that was mobilized to fill the gap wendy the welder was another less glamorized icon who in real life was janet doyle a welder in the richmond shipyards after some initial resistance from employers women replaced men in many traditionally male stateside jobs to support world war ii home front production efforts as men enlisted in active military service people of color encountered more lengthy resistance but ultimately were brought in the home front workforce the four richmond shipyards built by industrialist henry j kaisers firm employed 90 000 including tens of thousands of women of all ages and backgrounds in richmond these women helped build 747 ships in record time for use by the united states navy and merchant marine their labor marked an unprecedented entry into jobs never before performed by women and played a critical role in increasing american productivity to meet the demand for ships to overturn the german and japanese strategy to defeat the unitedstates navy these four shipyards constitute the largest world war ii shipyard operation in the unitedstates richmond also had 55 other wartime support industries and one of the nations largest wartime housing programs the ford assembly plant converted from automobile to tank production during the war processing over 60 000 tanks plus a variety of other military vehicles nationwide six million women entered the world war ii home front workforce the employment opportunities for black women and other women of color were unprecedented african americans asians hispanics and native americans were eventually employed for the first time to work side by side with whites in specialized highpaying jobs previously unavailable to them women and people of color earned more money than they ever had and mastered job skills that had been solely performed by white men up to that point many of the home front industries were set up at the nexus of railroad lines and harbors where materials could be assembled and shipped overseas richmond was ideally situated as a west coast rail terminus on san francisco bay and the golden gate opening to the pacific ocean during world war ii richmonds population grew dramatically from 23 642 to over 100 000 attracting people from all over the country by 1944 27 of the richmond shipyards workforce of 90 000 were women including over 41 of all welders and 24 of all craft employees another 10 000 workers including commuters from other bay area cities and towns worked in richmonds 55 other war industries the jobs available at world war ii home front industrial complexes attracted and actively recruitedworkers from across the country resulting in massive mostly permanent population relocations many who relocated from poor rural places and marginal jobs such as sharecropping were determined to stay on after world war ii the cities where the world war ii industries mobilized were confronted with overwhelming demands on housing transportation community services shopping and infrastructure to enable the 24hour production the largest companies such as kaiser and the public sector cooperated to provide round the clock child care food service health care and employee services despite their best efforts many workers often had to settle for marginal housing long lines for purchases and lengthy commutes in addition to the other home front sacrifices working conditions on the home front could be difficult and dangerous and took a very high toll a january 21 1944 new york times article cited industrial casualties women and men between pearl harbor and january 1st of this year aggregated 37 500 killed or 7 500 more than the military dead 210 000 permanently disabled and 4 500 000 temporarily disabled or 60 times the number of military wounded and missing while the ultimate united states casualty count on the battle front reached 295 000 the additional casualties on the home front represent the full price america paid to win the war for most americans the world war i1 home front experience also involved many daytoday adjustments to support the war effort these adaptations involved collection and recycling of strategic materials such as metal paper waste fat nylon silk and rubber twenty common commodities including gasoline sugar coffee shoes butter and meat were carefully rationed tires cars bicycles vacuum cleaners waffle irons and flashlights had to last because they were no longer manufactured people were asked to use it up wear it out make it do or do without victory gardens cropped up everywhere everyone bought war bonds national parks were closed women replaced men in professional sports leagues orchestras and many other tasks as world war h drew to a close warrelated industry jobs peaked in early 1945 and began to shut down as the last battles were fought after the war jobs for women and people of color diminished dramatically postwar jobs were largely reserved for returning servicemen propaganda messages were rephrased from telling women to come to work to advise them that their appropriate roles were not at home while most assumed those who relocated to the home front industrial sites would return to where they came from the majority of migrants were determined to stay the world war ii home front in richmondwas representative of other industrial centers that emerged specifically to support americas war effort many of those who worked in richmonds industries are part of the community today the effort to preserve these historic sites has been led by the city of richmond including mayor rosemary corbin and councilman

greater flexibility and closer contact with customers to a greater willingness to engage in highrisk research and development products despite their remarkable track record however small firms often

pharmaceuticals and the environment for example through r d funds from the national cancer institute facilitated by the sbir program gma industries has engaged in several projects that have led to technological innovations resulting in lower costs that are significantly under industry norms for document imaging and capture and database development additionally thanks to this program jobs have been created the economy has grown and america has remained at the forefront of innovation inc magazine has even called the sbir program the most important piece of small business legislation yet enacted in our lifetime small businesses may not have the huge budgets that some larger firms have but what they lack in size they make up in ideas what this program does is level the playing field this program gives most of those with the ideas but lacking resources an opportunity to develop their innovations it makes sure that those ideas are looked at and funded sbir and its participants keep this nation ahead of the curve and ahead of the world as a testament to its success sbir has been modeled and copied by several countries around the world representatives from the governments throughout the world come here to study this program so they can implement it back to their own countries the legislation we have before us today will reauthorize sbir for 7 years and make some minor technical changes even though authorization does not lapse until october of 2000 it is critical that we act now so that participating agencies are able to properly develop guidelines and assess their research needs to ensure that americas cutting edge firms continue to have opportunities available to them the other changes made by this legislation will allow small firms to continue research on marketable ideas developed under their grant providing them with the continuity that firms working on research and development need"], [0.997749722795561, 0.002250277204439044, 1, "i ask my colleagues

in my district in new york the issue is simple the miller highway which is 13 blocks long the entire thing 13 blocks half a mile was almost completely rebuilt only 5 years ago at a cost to the taxpayers of almost 90 million it has a life expectancy expectancy of 35 to 40 years before major rehabilitation work may be necessary now donald trump wants us to spend 300 to 350 million to tear it down a brand new highway and bury it bury it so it will not block the views of the hudson river from some of the apartments in his new riverside south luxury housing development for 350 million of the taxpayers money donald trump will get higher prices for his condos to add flame to the fire nobody even pretends there is any transportation purpose for this project whatsoever indeed the proposal is to replace a straight segment of highway with a curved segment never a good idea from a transportation perspective nobody in the area affected in the community wants this project it is opposed by every local elected official the state senator the state assembly member the new york city council member the manhattan borough president and the two local community planning boards in past years this project has been opposed consistently by the porkbusters coalition the council for citizens against government waste the national taxpayers union the taxpayers for common sense not to mention the administration much is said in this chamber about stopping waste and put an end to taxpayers subsidies for millionaires and billionaires today we have an opportunity to buttress these statements with actions to make it even worse this is a project that is not going to happen what we are doing is wasting money on planning an engineering studies for a project that will not happen in the letter that was quoted on the floor last year from the mayor of the city of new york he says as follows dated march 26 last year while the administration is fully committed to the miller highway relocation they think it is a good project unlike me it is critical that the funds for the project not redirect or act as an offset for federal or state funds for other transportation and infrastructure projects in new york city the city has numerous pressing highway and transportation needs that have federal financial support and the administration would not be able to support a relocation proposal that reduced the federal commitments to these other projects in other words they are only going to do this project if the house decides that we are going to take 300 million over and above what new york normally gets for transportation and give it specifically for this project that is obviously not going to happen they are not willing to the city government is not willing to take 300 million from the normal city federal aid for transportation take it away from other projects for this so what we are left with is a project that is not going to happen because no one is going to put the money into it but we will waste 6 million a year 5 million a year on environmental and planning studies and engineering studies for a project that will never happen my amendment is simply saying do not waste that 6 million 10 million on planning study for a project that should not happen and that will not happen"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00029283761978149414, 0.5002928376197815, 1, "i rise this evening with deep respect and with profound sadness in paying tribute to one of the greatest environmentalists of our time mr david r brower who passed away on sunday november 5 at his home in berkeley california mr browers distinguished career of dedication and commitment to the preservation of our environment spanned more than fifty years as a young man dave brower fell in love with our planet which he called earth island he servid as the executive director of the sierra club in 1952 and later founded two important environmental organizations the friends of the earth and the john muir institute for environmental studies in addition in 1982 he founded earth island institute an organization that promotes protection and conservation of wilderness around the world during his lifetime he led hard fought fights to establish numerous national parks and seashores including point reyes in northern california the northern cascades and the california redwoods among these accomplishments in the 1960s mr browers activism was instrumental in preventing the construction of two major dams in the grand canyon he was also successful in stopping plans to build dams at the green river in utah that would have seriously altered the landscape of the dinosaur national monument furthermore mr brower played a crucial role in the passage of the wilderness act of 1964 which preserved millions of acres of public land so that its natural conditions will remain for future generations to enjoy mr browers strong conviction and foresight did not come without personal sacrifice he took many hard stances for environmental protection that he believed would benefit humanity sometimes against his colleagues and many times against governmental agencies and these sacrifices make mr brower truly heroic the death of mr brower is a great loss to our nation i along with mr browersimmediate family friends admirers and supporters feel this monumental loss but as we mourn his death we also remember the legacy of hope and inspiration david left behind for us as a true leader in conservation his passion for preserving our planets remaining wilderness our national parks and seashores is a remarkable model of how one person can mobilize peoples consciousness to change and to better our lives and our world i cannot fully express enough gratitude for the contributions david brower has made to our society and to the viability of our planet but i can say that he literally changed the world for the better i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the late mr browers wife anne his four children kenneth

was submitted by my distinguished colleague the gentleman from new york this past weekend the brooklyn museum of art opened acontroversial new art exhibit despite strong objections from civic and religious leaders as many know the exhibit includes a desecrated portrait of the virgin mary decaying animals and a depiction of a child molester these are just a few of the offensive items in an exhibit recognized and celebrated for its shock value an over the edge flaunting of decay defamation and death it is a show intended to cause shock vomiting confusion panic euphoria and anxiety and those are the words of the brooklyn museum beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but i believe most american taxpayers do not have the stomach to support the display of this type of exhibit no matter what we think of this exhibit we can all agree that the american taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize any exhibit that denigrates the beliefs and values that they hold most dear ten years ago after the nea funded andres serranos defilement of the crucifix congress directed the chair of the national endowment of the arts to take into account general standards of decency and respect in awarding federal grant money to artists many artists protested that this was a violation of free speech rights in june of 1998 however the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the decency clause it was upheld because the court recognized that the right of free expression does not include the right to force others to pay for your expression the brooklyn museum is a great institution celebrating and displaying great works of art for over 176 years it has been a gift to our children encouraging them to explore the depths of their own creativity and imagination if there was ever a time when we needed to encourage our children to honor beauty it is now if there was ever a time to teach our children about great works of art of great painters sculptures and designers it is now but the brooklyn museums current exhibit is so extreme that children are not allowed to view it unless they are accompanied bya parent it seems to me that our public art institutions should be a safe haven for our children a place that honors the highest standards of beauty not the lowest common denominator of human depravity hard working americans help support the brooklyn museum of art through the national endowment of the arts the national endowment of the humanities and the institute of museum and library services in the past 3 years taxpayers have paid over 1 million to help fund the brooklyn museum in a time whedn our communities are desperate for more art classes local art museums and childrens workshops the brooklyn museum exhibit seems inconsistent with our priorities to foster a greater appreciation of the arts this debate is about whether or not taxpayers should subsidize the housing and promotion of objectionable exhibits american taxpayers have paid for the brick and mortar of the brooklyn museum a museum that should reflect the best of the american people this exhibit sponsored and hosted by the museum clearly does not reflect the values we hold dear this

like the postcensus local review give those local officials like they had in 1990 a chance to have a quality check another issue they are opposing and let me tell my colleagues this they are opposing making the census form available in numerous languages and braille they said we are going to put it in five languages besides english and if you know of another language tough you have to call an 800 number and hopefully you will find somebody who can translate and if you are blind you know tough i mean what do you do that is so sad they are opposed to it it is not that difficult to make available forms for those that request it to get these forms i was in miami we had a hearing back in december the gentlewoman from florida has about 150 000 haitians in her district now a lot of them have not learned english yet and how do they fill out a form our colleague the gentleman from california from long beach he has about 50 000 cambodians in his district now how do they fill out a form if an elderly person now somebody would say oh they should not be counted but everybody living in this country gets counted it is required by our united states constitution and here is amazing this is the democratic party that wants to reach out to everybody and they are refusing to publish the seven questions only seven questions in these languages and one of our bills is to put it out in 33 languages plus braille rather than the five languages their argument is well our five languages we get 99 percent of the people well 1 percent of the american people is 2 7 million people and we only missed 1 6 percent of the population last time why are they afraid to do that i mean it is the republicans are out there trying to make it more accessible to have everybody fill out the form and so i mean it is so frustrating that they say we are perfect we do not make mistakes and we are all professionals and you know do not micromanage well do not micromanage they are the ones that spent a billion dollars over the past 7 years on a illegal plan and it was not until january that they you know we got hit in the head they realized yes it was illegal and they said that is the reason we are going to go to two numbers i mean it is an amazing organization to deal with and these other ideas we are proposing it was another one they are opposed to is and this has support from general accounting office and at one time the academy of sciences supported it we get one form in the mail and you know hopefully everybody returns it we get as many as we can returned but if you send the second form as a reminder it will increase response rates by 6 or 7 percent they tried that out when they did what is called a dress rehearsal last year in sacramento and columbia south carolina they will get a 6 or 7 percent improvement on response rate that is about 19 million people that many fewer forms have to be filled out and they are opposed to it they are going to fight it and the president is going to veto it he is going to veto those 33 languages he is going to veto postcensus review i do not understand their logic it is so frustrating i mean even we had one program we debated for probably 45 minutes yesterday in committee it is something called census in the school program it is a good program and i hope when it becomes available that you can go to your schools and promote it especially when you go to the indian schools which we visited when we were in your district it was really kind of neat to see the indian schools there because what the census in school form is is going to be a form that is going to be sent out to the teachers of elementary schools in elementary schools and selected teachers in middle and secondary schools that teach geography i think government math i think three different categories and the idea is they will get a request if they want to participate in the program send back a card and they will get maps and materials and it is a good way to teach a civics lesson and you know they can teach mathematics they can teach geography there are lots of things kids can learn about the census and the constitution on it if the teachers want to so we are going to make it available the census bureau was only going to make it available to 20 percent of the schools and we think it is a good program so we commend them and say we think it should be made available to everybody all the schools they are contracting it out so it is not like extra work for them there is a group called scholastic inc that has got the contract and it is just a matter of sending the letter to all these teachers and if they like it send back a card and they fought us and fought us and fought us yesterday over that issue and they finally agreed to let it go by voice vote and i understand i said are you opposed to 60 percent of the teachers receiving this why are you opposed to the possibility of helping kids we can get members of congress to go to schools in their district to help promote it it is something that is good civics it is good public policy and you know they finally gave in and voice voted it was amazing"], [0.0018429756164550781, 0.5018429756164551, 0, "i
