the privilege of representing a large portion of mr bennetts old district and as you can imagine i have very large shoes to fill i have always considered charlie bennett to be a great american hero and a person whose career i have attempted to use as a benchmark for my own for those of us who are fortunate to know him mr bennett is a fine example to follow you along with many many members of this body served with charlie bennett in congress so i do not need to tell you why he is so deserving of this honor however if you will allow me i would like to mention a few of the notable accomplishments which mark his tremendous career congressman bennett was elected to congress in november 1947 and has the ninth longest record of continued service in the unitedstates congress he answered over 17 000 recorded votes and did not miss a single legislative vote from june 5 1951 through to the day of his retirement as many of you know mr bennett came to congress following 4 years of service in the army during world war ii he contracted polio during the war and has been forced to use walking canes ever since during his first campaign some questioned his health and wondered whether he was physically able to meet his congressional responsibilities in fact mr bennett was hospitalized several times during his first congressional term but in the summer of 1951 with his medical difficulties behind him bennett decided that the best way to prove his physical abilities mental resolve and commitment to the job to which he was elected was to promise himself never to miss a legislative voteand it was a promise he kept mr bennett is a man of honor and integrity and left a legacy behind to prove it his legislation created the house ethics committeewhich he twice chaired in addition he authored the code of ethics for government service and other legislation in the area of govemment ethics his legislation also made in god we trust our national motto bennett was also a champion of this countrys armed forces he believed and still does that our fighting men and women deserve the best equipment and training necessary to fulfill the missions to which they are assigned as chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on seapower bennett fought to enhance americas sealift capacity and enhance our unitedstates flagged fleet in jacksonville mr bennett is thought of as the father of the navy he worked to turn mayport naval station a surplus military facility when bennett was elected to congress into a aircraft carrier homeport and the second largest such port on the east coast in addition he successfully secured three naval air stations in jacksonville but mr bennetts first love is the environment last year he was quoted as saying i love the outdoors it is the closest to god you can get while still on earth because of his desire to protect this nations natural and historic resources for future generations bennett authored and secured the passage of national legislation to preserve historic sites and treasure ships and protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive sites his legislation also created the ft caroline national memorial and the timucuan ecological and historic preserve in jacksonville putting his money where his mouth is bennett also donated all of his excess campaign funds over 200 000 to the national park service for the purpose of land acquisition if you think all this makes charlie bennett a hero you are correct but he was already a hero when he got to congress as an army captain mr bennett led guerrilla fighters in the phillipines in the northern luzon mountains and was awarded the silver star for gallantry in action the phillipines decorated him with the legion of honor the highest award for a nonfilipino he was elected to the infantry hall of fame by the fort benning officer candidate school it is fair to say that no public official has done more for the city of jacksonville than charlie

washington post on june 29 1993 which states that the national helium reserve is a rare good federal program and that the helium field operates well in a general manner and this is a federal program that does work what the gentleman told my colleagues my friend from california is a little misleading back in the 1960s when the federal government purchased the helium they placed that helium in reserves up in amarillo tx and in other areas across the country but during that period of time the bureau of mine set an interest rate that they would pay back to the unitedstates treasury the federal government never appropriated funds to help pay back that interest rate during that period of time interest rates would go up to 18 percent and drop down to some of the lower rates of interest that we are witnessing today well over that period of time madam chairman we have now seen a billion dollars worth of interest that is owed to the federal government it is basically one agency owing another agency interest payments gao studied this problem and their recommendation back to congress was that congress should forgive the billiondollarinterest note if we were able to do that we would see the helium operation in a sense giving back to the federal government anywhere from 10 to 11 million a year in the current program that we now have madam chairman we appropriate about 23 million from the unitedstates treasury to different federal agencies basically through the bureau of mines and that money is then used in different federal agencies of which nasa is a big user of the helium that we produce in this country but we return back to the unitedstates treasury 13 million now the reason that the gentleman from california my friend is supporting us the private sector selling helium to nasa is because he claims that it can be at a cheaper price than what the federal government offers well the reason the federal governments helium prices are higher than the private sector is because president bush chose to raise the price of helium when in all honesty the answer is for the federal g6vernment to lower the price of helium we can indeed sell helium cheaper than the private sector can this is a resource that the taxpayers own we paid 750 million for this resource it is now valued at over a billion dollars but the debate here today is not what to do with the

the roemer zimmer amendment on wednesday will consider carefully the fact is that a vote for a program in the context of an authorization bill is essentially a free vote because it is not competing against any other program as senator hatfield was quoted as saying in todays washington post legislative authorization is a hunting license because it allows a department or agency to look for funding actually to carry out the authorized programs in contrast when you look at the space station in the context of an appropriations bill as we will today you are talking about a zero sum game because every dollar spent on the space station is a dollar less spent on something else it is either a dollar less spent on deficit reduction a dollar less spent on veterans programs a dollar less spent on housing programs or as my colleague from florida has pointed out a dollar less spent on nasa itself the fact is that in ramping up space station expenditures in the appropriations bill in order to meet the request of the clinton administration the space shuttleprogram had to take a considerable reduction in its funding in the appropriations committee similarly there was a 40 million cut made in the hope program the home ownership program initiated by jack kemp in the last administration in order to free up money for the space station so this is a vote in the context of the real world a vote in the context of competing needs and competing demands for our budget dollars and in the context of an overall commitment that many of us have made for deficit reduction that is why many members who voted last year against killing the space station when the proposal was an amendment to an authorization bill shortly afterwards voted in favor of a similar amendment in the context of an

like it to it will at least go in the right direction i urge the members of congress to pass these reforms to protect our social security recipients benefits and to guarantee americans a secure retirement as chairman of the house republican social security task force i support this social security administrative reform act social security is a trustbetween the american people and their government in recent years that trust has eroded first senior citizens are justifiably upset that political and budget battles have put their hardearned social security benefits many times in jeopardy why just last year the clinton administration forced through this congress a 26 5 billion social security tax on social security recipients the american people are outraged that drug addicts and alcoholics are spending their supplemental security income and social security disability insurance benefits on drugs and alcohol while the time for solutions is long overdue todays house action will take us at least a step in the right direction todays bill will make social security an independent agency to protectamericans retirement funds from political and budget battles every social security beneficiary both current and future must be assured that his and her benefits will be secure and that the program will be administered fairly and soundly by walling off social security as an independent agency congress will help to assure the american people that social security funds will be used for social security purposes only todays bill also will tighten the rules for drug addicts and alcoholics who receive these benefits as i testified before the subcommittee back in february the american people are outraged that our social security has degenerated into a cash cow for addicts

states forces msut exit haiti but does state that the president should have consulted congress prior to our intervention it is identical to legislation just passed in the senate 918 i offer this substitute not because i am a warmongerer who places the interests of other countries beforethe safety of our own children i offer this amendment because i am a supporter of democracy a humanitarian a resident of south floridi and a believer in the ability of our own military commanders i have said from day one that if haiti is not hospitable to its own people those same people will flock to south florida an area whose emergency health and human services budgets have already splintered from the weight of illegal immigration if my constituents tell methat they cannot handle another wave of immigrants at this time then i will support any plan to keep those immigrants out of south florida and if that plan includes in vading haiti to remove the illegal military occupation whose minions were terrorizing the populace and assisting in the return of the democraticallyelected president then i will support the invasion many of my colleagues in this body have criticized president clinton for sending troops to haiti some argue that it is not our problem to solve while others are infuriated that the president did not seek prior eongressional authorization for the invasion i found it fascinating that many members who opposed this limited authorization supported during the l0 st congress sending 20 million to haiti in the report to h r 4636 many of these same members said this aid will send a signal that the united states supports the effort to establish civilian authority over the military and encourages further movement toward democratic government the 20 million authorized in this legislation for haiti is an appropriate indication of the united states commitment to civilian democratic rule in that country there are those who will oppose our current policy because they loathe the person who is directing it but some are truly opposed to our involvement in a situation which does not warrant our action to refute this statement one must ask for what reasons has the united states intervened in foreign crises the united states has since the inception of the union used our armed forces abroad 234 times in situations of conflict or potential conflict our justification was that our national existence was threatened specific treaty requirements were abrogated freedom of the seas was threatened we opposed aggression by one state against another we were protecting unitedstates citizens abroad countering terrorism protecting the sanctity of the western hemisphere from outside powers lending support to our allies in trouble and certain situations which require intervention for humanitarian reasonsso what are our interests in haiti and do they fit into the proinvolvement puzzle the people of haiti elected a president jeanbertrand aristide that president was overthrown by the head of the military raoul cedras aristide and cedras signed an accord the governors island accord to facilitate the return of the president that accord was virtually ignored by the haitian military leaders for almost 2 years until virtually days before an invasion by the united states president clinton dispatched to haiti a delegation led by former president jimmy carter president carter worked out an agreement with the acting president of haiti which set a deadline for the military leaders to retire and the democraticallyelected president jeanbertrand aristide to return to haiti our forces are now in haiti assisting with this transition by virtue of the fact that there was a coup by the military which overthrew a democraticallyelected president unitedstates
