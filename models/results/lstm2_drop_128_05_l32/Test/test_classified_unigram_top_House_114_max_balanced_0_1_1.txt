flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan

address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential

committee i could not support it either in committee or on the house floor i couldnt support it because it cut snap the supplemental nutrition assistance program our nations premier antihunger program i couldnt support a bill that i believed made hunger worse in america at the time members of both parties offered many assurances that the changes to snaps relationship with liheap the low income home energy assistance program wouldnt hurt snap recipients that the changes were merely closing a loophole rather than a true benefit cut i was skeptical of those assurances at the timeand with good reason the congressional budget office estimated that the change would reduce benefits for about 850 000 lowincome households by an average of 90 a month in the 14 states and the district of columbia that took advantage of a state option to link liheap and snap states chose to use this option to alleviate some of the heartbreaking choices that poor families face seniors and the disabled are all too often the ones forced to choose between buying food or heating their homes or paying for their prescriptions throughout the farm bill process antihunger advocates in the heat and eat states vigorously opposed the liheap cuts to snap saying their effects would be much greater than the congressional budget office estimates im sorry to say they were right these cuts are much more than just abstract numbers we are starting to hear real stories from real people who are seeing their snap benefits cut hunger is worse in this country because of these cuts take judy beals a disabled senior from belleville wisconsin earlier this year she saw her snap benefit cut from 120 a month to 16 a month let me repeat that she now gets 16 a month in food assistance that is it that is unconscionable how could anyone afford to feed themselves for a month on that ms beals says she is forced to eat just once a day now that her snap benefit has been cut as she tries to figure out how to pay her other bills to add insult to injury ms beals found out that her snap benefit had been cut at the register at the grocery store with a full cart of groceries ms beals story is not unique the hunger task force in milwaukee estimates that in wisconsin alone 255 000 families have seen their snap benefits reduced since the liheap cuts went into effect we are hearing similar stories in new jersey another state that did not extend its heat and eat program the food bank of south new jersey estimates that 160 000 new jersey residents have lost about 90 a month in snap benefits due to the farm bill cut now to be fair there are several states including my home state of massachusetts that did the right thing and found a way mostly with state funds to make up the money lost by the liheap cut in the

states that did not make up the money we will continue to hear stories of people who have seen their snap benefit cut i am proud to serve on the house agriculture committee since the beginning of this

in snap but i have this sinking feeling in my stomach that these hearings are not leading to a place that is good for millions of struggling americans the fact is snap is a good program it works it is effective and it is efficient it is one of the most efficiently run federal programs that exists with an unbelievably low error rate instead of cutting snap or making other harmful policy changes we should be strengthening the program democratic and republican witnesses alike have testified before the agriculture committee that the snap benefit is already too low we have heard that the certification and recertification process is timeconsuming and onerous especially for working families we have heard about people who are eligible to get renewed benefits who fall off the program because of these onerous new requirements we have heard from charities that they cannot solve the problems of hunger on their own charities do incredible work but they cannot meet the demand for food assistance they need a strong federal partner we need better coordination among all stakeholdersfederal agencies nonprofits faithbased organizations and businessesto end hunger that is why i have been advocating for a white house conference on food nutrition and hunger we need a coordinated holistic plan to end hunger now if we make further cuts to snap we will no doubt hear more stories like ms

floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to

conclude its military conflicts mr utley quoted conservative columnist peggy noonan who wrote we spend too much on the military which not only adds to our debt but guarantees that our weapons will be used she quoted one expert who said policymakers will find uses for them to justify their expense which will implicate us in crises that are none of our business conservative icon william f buckley shortly before he passed away came out strongly against the war in iraq he wrote a respect for the power of the united states is engendered by our success in engagements in which we take part a point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose but misapplication of pride he added that if the war dragged on as it certainly has there has been skepticism about our venture there will be contempt a couple of weeks ago we saw an iraq army which we have trained for years and on which we have spent megabillions cutting and running at the first sign of a fight we should not be sending our young men and women to lead and or fight in any war where the people in that country are not willing to fight for themselves fiscal conservatives should be the ones most horrified by and most opposed to the horrendous waste and trillions of dollars we have spent on these very unnecessary wars in the middle east last week 19 republicans voted for a resolution saying that we should bring our troops home from iraq and afghanistan the republican leadership of the foreign affairs committee did not want any republicans to speak in favor of that resolution so mr jones mr sanford and mr massie requested and received time from the democratic sponsor mr mcgovern i did not want to do that but i at least wanted to point out today that there has been nothing conservative about our policy of permanent forever endless war in the middle east in his most famous speech president eisenhower warned us against the military industrial complex we should not be going to war in wars that are more about money and power and prestige than they are about any serious threat to the united states i think president eisenhower would be shocked at how far we have gone down that path that he warned us

american people indeed it has been a difficult week for california and for the leadership of women who we have seen come forward in our state over recent years especially in the political arena my colleague representative mimi walters from southern california earlier this week paid tribute to marian bergeson a great political leader in our state in her time who we lost several days ago well now we have lost another gem and that is sharon oden runner i learned of her passing this morning she underwent some years ago a very very daring and amazing lung transplant to overcome the condition she had she fought hard all these years and did quite well with that until recent times so this tribute today to her is for her her family and that memory sharon and i came up together in the california state legislature back in 2002 we both won terms in the state assembly she was just a good pal right out of the chute there as new freshman members we were getting to know our way around sacramento and the state legislative process several of the freshman bonded there was a pack of us guys and sharon you know because there are a lot more guys in politics it seems so sharon being just a few years older than the rest of us guys she kind of seemed like the one that was keeping us a little more in line as we would go about doing our business in the state legislature cutting up a little bit here and there once in a while amidst the seriousness or at the events you do around town at night meeting other people and such so i soon dubbed her ma runner lovingly and affectionately and she took that okay and she was the one who would say you boys now you stay in line here okay but we all had a lot of fun together and worked hard together and fought the battles together in the california legislative process it was really fun to see her ascend when our current majority leader here kevin mccarthy became our assembly leader there sharon ascended right there beside him as the assistant leader for the republicans as well and she really did well in that role and was effective and just really good to get along with and made sure that all the members had what they needed in order to do well sharons spirit was one of always being so positive reaching out to everybody she worked to get more women elected to the legislature as well and she was one with very strong moral convictions as well to make sure that her faith in god was something that she brought forward with her policy and was something that wasnt very far away in how she conducted herself and for her family and for those that she came into contact with so we had that opportunity to serve 6 years together in the state assembly and then with term limits being what they are we soon met up again in that legislative role over on the california state senate side now at that point sharon was again struggling with her lung battles there and got that amazing lung transplant that life that was given to her by a donor that she carried forward for these years until finally the issues became too complex and again we lost her this morning so our hearts do go out to george micah bekah all of her friends all of her extended family those who had a chance to know her and were touched and graced by her we are better for it we know that we will always cherish the memories george and sharon had a unique time together as the first husbandwife team in the california state legislature he was in the senate for a while and she was in the assembly a lot of history was made by them through measures they were able to put on the ballot the things they always fought for morally and policywise they will always be remembered as working together now as george soldiers on our hearts are with you we wish you gods strength and peace and only the sweetest memories to your whole family we remember sharon today god bless her and god bless her memory"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00037986040115356445, 0.5003798604011536, 0, "i urge my

strong support of h r 719 the tsa office of inspection accountability act of 2015 as ranking member of the subcommittee on transportation security i have a responsibility to ensure that the transportation security administration operates effectively and efficiently part of this responsibility includes working to ensure that not a single taxpayer dollar is wasted so that resources are properly expended to protect our nations airports and the traveling public regrettably we have learned from the department of homeland securitys inspector general that the tsas office of inspection is not operating effectively and efficiently specifically we have learned that taxpayer dollars have been wasted in a manner that may well be undermining the effectiveness and integrity of internal investigations and inspections within the tsa according to a report issued by the inspector general in september of 2013 some employees in the office of inspection were designated criminal investigators and have received the premium pay and early retirement benefits commensurate with that position despite the fact that they perform little to no investigative duties apparently the office of inspection knowingly made these improper designations and knowingly conferred better pay and benefits to employees who did not do the work required to justify such compensation if no changes are made to the number of criminal investigator positions the inspector general estimates that it will result in the wasting of as much as 17 5 million over 5 years h r 719 seeks to put an end to this wasteful practice and prevent it from happening in the future this bill would require tsa to certify that all persons designated as criminal investigators are working on criminal investigations at least 50 percent of their time if the tsa wants to provide an employee with the enhanced pay and benefits that criminal investigators receive then they should have to certify that the employee is actually performing the duties of a criminal investigator that is just common sense this measure would not affect individuals in that office who legitimately hold the criminal investigator title and would not impede efforts to thwart terror plots and other criminal enterprises that threaten our national security again this legislation is common sense it reflects a commitment to good government

jeff fortenberry and his lead cosponsor anna eshoo for their extremely important resolution h con res 75 as amended calling on the obama administration to declare the annihilation of christians yazidis and other minorities for what it is a genocide on december 4 of last year a coalition of prominent religious leaders wrote president obama and stated christian and yazidi minorities in iraq and syria are being targeted for eradication in their ancient homelands solely because of their religious beliefs they had been prompted by reports of an imminent state department finding that isis was committing genocide against the yazidis a finding they wholeheartedly endorsed but were deeply troubled like we all were that the genocide of christians was going to be bypassed or excluded apparently press reports had claimed that the rationale for excluding christians was that unlike the yazidis christians had a choice to convert to islam and pay an islamic tax or be killed tortured enslaved or held hostage in direct rebuttal of that argument at a hearing that i held on december 9 carl anderson the supreme knight of the knights of columbus stated many times the payment of the tax is not presented as an option for these christians in instances where the yazidi tax has been enacted or extracted it has failed to ensure that the christians could live as christians that they were protected from rival jihadists or even other members of isis or that the amendment of payment was not raised over time until it became impossible for some of them to pay causing the familys home and even their children to be confiscated and the adults to be killed or forced to become muslims it is a very very poor argument that has been made by the state department so we believe they have made this hopefully they will rectify it let me also point out to my colleagues that the genocide convention defines genocide as the killing and certain other acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group the religious leaders who signed the december 4 letter compiled extensive files supporting a finding that isis treatment of iraqi and syrian christians absolutely meets this definition they include evidence of isis assassinations of church leaders mass murders torture kidnapping for ransom in the christian communities of iraq and syria sexual enslavement and systematic rape of christian girls and women its practices of forcible conversions to islam its destruction of churches monasteries cemeteries and christian artifacts and its theft of lands and wealth from christian clergy and laity alike they went on to cite isis own public statements taking credit for mass murder of christians and expressing its intent eliminate christian communities from the islamic state the letter recounted how isis jihadis have stamped christian homes in mosul with the red letter n for nazarene in the summer of 2014 pointing out how the elimination of christians in other towns and cities in iraq and syria began long beforehand i held a hearing 3 years ago extolling and urging the administration to recognize the genocide against christians and our witnesses the private witnesses who spoke gave instance after instance of crimes against christians that were done simply because they were christians at a december 9 hearing we heard from four witnesses i mentioned one a moment ago carl anderson from the knights of columbus we also heard from dr stanton of genocide watch who said failure to call isis mass murder of christians shiia muslims and other groups in addition to the yazidis by its proper name genocide would be an act of denial as grave as the unitedstates refusal to recognize the rwanda genocide back in 1994 1615 bishop kalabat a chaldean bishop was extremely pointed in his remarks when he said that the obama administration including president obama himself have neglected to mention that the isis atrocities were committed against christians they rightly mention atrocities committed in iraq against the yazidis and they are horrific the bishop went on but there are also atrocities of rape killings crucifixions beheadings hangings that the syrian and iraqi christians have endured and they are intentionally omitted he compellingly stated that the unitedstates government should not turn a blind eye to the genocidal atrocities faced by iraqs ethnic and religious minorities including the christians the yazidis and others finally in very very powerful testimony the head of yezidi human rights organizationinternational mr ismail stated that though his people the yazidis were on the verge of annihilation he called upon the administration not to neglect the others who are also on the verge of annihilation and said the yazidis and the chaldoassyrian christians face this genocide together now is the time to act we cannot let the cries of the victims go unheeded as we once did when

opinions i think they should have the authority we should remove the small site exemption and they should look at emissions from the fracking industry and the extraction but that is a valid discussion to have instead of that we are saying you are doing what we told you to do but we want to grant a stay so congress under the epa in section 112 directed the epa under the clean air act to promulgate these regulations president george bush did so they were tossed out and now there is a new set of regulations going forward to implement what congress wanted the epa to do now if the gentleman from alabama doesnt want the epa to do that lets have that discussion about epas authority i am happy to do it i have ideas maybe there are some areas the epa shouldnt have that mandate authority there are other areas like making sure we look at emissions from fracking where we need enhanced authority because there is something called the small site exemption in the clean air act where even though each particular fracking pad has a very small contribution to air quality when you start having thousands of them in a limited areawhich we doit starts looking a lot less like a couple automobiles and a lot more like a large industrial factory so they shouldnt be exempt just by nature of being small because when you have a lot of small things it equals not only one big thing it equals 10 big things and 100 big things we have over 40 000 active wells in the greater weldlarimer county area alone and there is an enormous impact on our air quality which is exempt under the small site exemption so again section 112 directs the epa to promulgate these rules if we want to open up the mandate that congress has given the epa lets have that discussion as an individual legislator i might trade you this brick kiln authority if we can close the small site exemption i would say fine my constituents care more about closing that small site exemption than they do if there are two brick kilns in our entire state so i think in general my constituents and coloradans care more about making sure our air quality is good and protected with regard to the emissions from the fracking activity than from the two brick kilns so i would be open to that as a legislative compromise that is how legislation is made but we are not allowed to have that debate the gentleman mentioned oh no amendments were brought forward guess what we did a motion in the rules committeei am sure the gentleman from alabama remembersyesterday to do an open rule on this if that had passedand it failed on a partisan vote not a single republican voted to allow an open rule on this bill if that had succeeded if that had passed that open rule the democrats wanted we could then introduce amendments like the ones that i mentioned to talk about the authority of the epa or other issues that we have to improve the statutory requirements in charge of the epa right on the floor we would have the opportunity to do that instead we have an entire day on brick kilns without even being allowed to introduce amendments that affect our clean air and water in any way shape or form i think we can do better the gentleman also asked what the impact of the brick kilns on this is the epa estimates that the brick and clay rule would reduce national air toxins by approximately 375 tons in 2018 again that is what congress has told the epa to do under the clean air act if congress wants the epa to do something different lets have that discussion section 112 other sections of the clean air act of the mandate that congress has given the epa lets not use a court procedure a stay that wont become law to shortcircuit something that congress has told the epa to do it is positively schizophrenic for congress to require an

reservation summer was an amazing time in my state smoke enveloped downtown portland and drifted all the way for 270 miles to the south in medford as i drove past into central oregon the crater lake national park consumed 25 square miles throughout the west 8 5 million acres have already been burned this year and like we hear almost every year the 2015 fire season is one of the worst on record we should acknowledge the amazing men and women who are on the front lines and the tremendous strain they bear we need so many people that we have actually had active military personnel brought online for the first time in a decade even firefighters from australia new zealand and canada have come to assist in these efforts one cannot say enough about the tremendous bravery and sheer hard work involved on so many levels with the men and women who are literally putting their lives on the line for this heroic fight but it is important to note that we are not just decimating our forests we are decimating the forest service budget the portion of the overall budget spent on fighting wildfires has grown in the last 20 years from 16 percent to over onehalf 52 percent because congress refuses to treat wildfires like other natural disasters the forest service budget is being consumed squeezing out other critical areas not just maintaining these special places and trails and recreational opportunities but even the efforts that would deal with forest health and reduce the danger and the cost of future firefights the trend is that twothirds of the budget in the next 10 years will be firefighting absolutely totally unacceptable these fires ought to be treated like any other natural disaster not decimate our ability to manage our national forests the people dealing with these megafires know that part of the problem is climate change making itself felt less than 2 percent of these megafires consume almost onethird of the total fire suppression costs because our forests are drier there is less snow and rainfall one more graphic reminder of the devastating impact of climate change with higher temperatures and less water it is past time that congress steps up to reduce carbon emissions perhaps the pope in 2 weeks will inspire us to do something about climate change but in the meantime we should at least pass h r 167 the wildfire disaster actbipartisan legislation introduced on the very first day of this congress but languishing in committeethat would treat megafires like other natural disasters not discriminate against the forest service one final point is that we should stop making the problem worse by allowing more and more people to move into the fire zone in the wildlandurban interface and give these people the illusion that somehow they are going to be provided with urbanlevel fire protection sixty percent of the new homes since 1990 have been built in the flame zone we should stop this madness because we are putting more people at risk not just to their properties and their families but also the men and women who fight forest fires to protect structures remember the 19 hotshots who were killed in arizona a couple years ago who lost their lives trying to save homes that probably shouldnt have been there in the first place commonsense budgeting fighting climate change and reasonable land use will reduce costs protect lives and allow us to begin spending money on prevention which will in turn reduce further costs it more than pays for itself sensible budgeting prevention sound land use planning will protect people and our forests along with our budgets while we start our long overdue actions to reduce carbon pollution it is time that congress steps up to start addressing these problems now this is not rocket science"]]}
