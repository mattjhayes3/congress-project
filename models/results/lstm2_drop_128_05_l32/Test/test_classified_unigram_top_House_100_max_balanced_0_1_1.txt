washington now is the time to enable goodfaith conduct of the negotiations in central america i am further disappointed by the lack of bipartisan discussion on a broadly acceptable alternative if we must vote today we should at least be sending a strong signal to central america that a large majority of congress supports the peace process instead we are arguing over specifics of a policy and losing sight of the shared goal of peace in the region such rancor is detrimental to the difficult task of forging peace we all had hoped there would be a ceasefire before congress returned to this issue certainly our task would be much easier if that had occurred unfortunately that is not the case but we must continue to support the efforts of president arias and urge progress in the negotiations between the contras and the sandinistas the question then is which of the alternatives before us today best advances the cause of peace the michel proposal insists on maintaining the military capabilities of the contras the foley substitute would strike this march 1 988 nonlethal aid and limit assistance to food medicine and clothing president arias has indicated that providing humanitarian assistance to the contras is not inconsistent with the guatemala peace agreement however providing the type of military supplies contained in the michel proposal clearly violates the terms of the agreement a decision by this house to resume military assistance could have a dramatic and regrettable effect upon the fragile peace process the foley substitute is certainly not perfect however its clearly preferable to the resumption of militaryrelated assistance and far better than settling into a series of votes on military aid over the next few months i am encouraged that this approach would shift delivery of all humanitarian assistance to the international committee of the red cross or other international relief agencies as soon as hostilities cease the substitute also prohibits delivery of currently stockpiled military supplies further this proposal encourages both sides to reach a formal ceasefire agreement by providing for continuation of humanitarian assistance through the end of the year in that event let me reiterate i regret that we are once again delving into contra policy in the midst of the central american peace process but we are faced with only two options todaymilitary aid or sustenance aid to the contras thus i will support the foley substitute because it is the most policy neutral it has the best chance of moving the peace process forward it

certainly i commend president reagan health and human services secretary otis bowen and my esteemed colleagues pete stark and bill gradison for their leadership and efforts in developing legislation

percent of medicares 30 million elderly would benefit from the part a and part b payment expansions i strongly believe that by limiting our focus to the acute care illness we will be missing a real opportunity to act upon what i consider to be the real risks that most senior citizens face in a truly catastrophic illnessnamely those associated with longterm and nursing home care the time has come for congress to reexamine the medicare program and to address the changing needs of our senior citizens therefore the legislation i am introducing today addresses some of the most critical longterm care needs of our elderly population the bill also offers incentives to the workingage population for developing their own longterm care protection i have attempted to create balance in the bill by incorporating a combination of governmental individual and employer incentives to address the issue of longterm care my legislation has three major titles first my bill creates a new part c of the medicare program to offer financial assistance for nursing home home health and communitybased services that the elderly need for long periods of time this longterm care benefit is income related that is the amount of an individuals outofpocket expense is related to his income level the second provision of the bill provides for individual incentives to allow an individual over the age of 50 to contribute up to 1 500 of noncoreinterest income toward the purchase of a longterm care insurance policy as an added incentive this policy would retain a cashsurrender value so that should the individual predecease the use of the policy its value would roll over into his estate and could be transferred to his spouse finally the bill provides for group incentives for longterm care catastrophic protection this congress has a real opportunity to act on some very critical health policy issues but i hope we do so in a manner that looks toward tomorrow as well as takes in the needs

of h r 558 was reported by the committee on agriculture as h r 177 the goal of that legislation is to help meet the food needs of homeless people an issue the committee has looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month effective third exempts housing assistance payments made on behalf of households living in temporary quarters from consideration as income for food stamp purposes such payments will not be counted if the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this problem will require

employment the bill creates a newwork education and training program for afdc recipients assists those families in making the transition from welfare to work by subsidizing day care expenses for those

voting today the temptation not to be here the temptation not to speak was almost overwhelming but not to come down here and speak would put me in that category of people who are not accounted for and i could not live with that because these are only fleeting moments in our service here when we are faced with such a momentous occasion and momentous time to cast our vote and so not to do so would be

no fighting in our territory on our shores or on our continent if there is one thing that bothers a soldier it is not the enemy before him but the possibility that he would be abandoned by the main body behind him there is no despair greater than can descend on a soldier than to know that he has been deserted let me say to my friends i am telling them that if the cancer down in the southern part of this hemisphere is not stopped it is going to go north and the sword will be cut by a red machete and the only thing that is going to stop it is not an ocean but a riverthe river rio grande and if

are in the majority in the senate that this has already been worked out with the senate and we should not be putting this into statute we all know that it has already been done third on the last smith

many other countries such as france germany italy japan the netherlands saudi arabia turkey and great britain could go on i just think this is a bad time for us to be legislating this kind of
