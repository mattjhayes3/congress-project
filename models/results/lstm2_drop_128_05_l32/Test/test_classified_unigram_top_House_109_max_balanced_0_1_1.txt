exploration drilling and production of natural gas off our intercontinental shelf this is an important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be

to the rank of chief of staff commanded the israeli defense force in the six day war of 1964 shortly after leading his troops to a stunning decisive victory in that historical war rabin retired from the military to become a diplomat and politician perhaps suggesting that peace was more effectively sought through diplomacy than through war rabih who spent a majority of his life as an instrument of

the gentleman for yielding me time to begin with i want to thank the gentleman from lou isiana for his leadership and his contribution to the state of louisiana both with the committee on financial services and within our delegation because of the hurricanes in louisiana mississippi and alabama over 1 million households have been affected between 40 and 50 percent of those households whether rented or owned will need to be completely replaced these are high numbers and do not even include katrinas damage in florida in fact fema estimates that 300 000 families are homeless and 200 000 will require government housing this is a housing crisis unlike anything we have seen in this country due to a natural disaster here in the united states a country that gives more in aid to countries around the world than any other we have largely been unable to provide the basic need of housing for our citizens today is the 36th day since hurricane katrina made landfall and there are still thousands of louisianans in shelters across this country and the state of louisiana these numbers do not even reflect the number of people living in private homes in churches and motels for 36 days now these people have slept on cots they have eaten at community tables and showered in communal facilities these people the citizens of our country want their privacy they want to use the phone at will they want to sleep in their own beds they want to have the freedom to walk around without carrying their belongings and they want to tuck their children into bed at night in peace and not have strangers watching them in this country of great prosperity and resources people should not be forced to live like this for over a m6nth this act will give the secretary of hud the authority to waive specific requirements under section 8 and projectbased assistance programs for victims of hurricanes katrina and rita in order to expedite emergency housing assistance to those families that need it the most thiswaiver authority will last for a period of 6 months with a 6month extension beyond that if the secretary deems it necessary by waiving the requirements of verification of incomfe and initial inspection of units we are enabling displaced persons who have lost documentation due to the hurricanes to obtain vouchers and ensuring occupancy immediately by waiving the initial inspections by removing the 1year rental contract requirement that the vouchers be confined to a specific area we are making sure that people have the flexibility to determine where and how they will live while many people are deciding what to do on a permanent basis they still need temporary but independent living arrangements this bill does just that this bill authorizes the secretary to directly administer section 8 vouchers if the appropriate housing agency is unable to do so because of damage or displaced employees due to the hurricanes this will ensure that those persons traditionally served will continue to be served by huds programs this bill requires the secretary to report to congress within 30 days of the enactment of this legislation on federal civilian and defense facilities that can be used to provide emergency housing or as locations for construction or deployment of temporary housing units lastly it requires the comptroller general to submit a report to congress identifying and describing states that have developed emergency housing contingency plans for use in the event of a disaster to help us be better prepared the next time while i recognize that this is not all that is needed to address the housing crisis this is a step in the right direction and part of the overall plan to get people into more permanent living arrangements we cannot solely rely on the trailer plan to house displaced persons these vouchers offer choice to people use existing housing and do not necessitate the need to build additional public housing i am concerned for the people of ny state i am concerned for the people of the gulf coast region it is time for us to take action to get these people out of the shelters and into apartments into homes or ipto a place where they can begin to start their lives over these are americans they are our citizens i urge my colleagues to help pass h r 3894 it is time that we act to get our citizens out of these shelters and into

the corporation for public broadcasting from controlling the content of public broadcasting services i do not see why this language is necessary today the law is already there you have different points of view as to what is the characteristics of public broadcasting and that is conservative liberal or whatever i think this amendment is unnecessary in light of current law let cpb do its job and stop trying to politicize it i will point out one further thing this amendment would negatively impact on cpbs ability to assist in the production of quality educational programming for example if this amendment were to be law if ken burns whom we all are familiar with were to serve as a consultant to the national park service on battlefield conservation he then would be prohibited from producing any documentaries for pbs or local public tv stations the amendment would alter public broadcastings authorization that is presently in the law and i think it would cripple the abilities of cpb to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want it to do and that is to be an objective medium to present all sides of every issue and not attempt to politicize the message with the present law it seems to me that there is no need for this amendment i urge my colleagues to vote against it if we do have a roll call vote"]]}
