of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.021775424480438232, 0.9782245755195618, 1, "the bushs administration national security priorities are so out of balance that it is hard to know where to begin between the debacle in iraq the failure to address americas true homeland security needs and funding for research on new nuclear weapons there are plenty of options to choose from last october during the final presidential debate before the november election president bush claimed that the gravest threat americafaces is the threat of nuclear attack unfortunately the president has done very little to address this threat one of the primary nuclear threats america faces is the development of such hostile weapons by countries like iran and north korea that is why we need to engage these nations in aggressive diplomacy not aggressive saber rattling earlier this week north korea indicated that it wishes to hold bilateral talks with the united states presumably to receive financial assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program iran on the other hand feels threatened by recent w~hispers that the bush administration might attempt a military assault on their nuclear weapons facilities we absolutely must negotiate with both countries after using the unitedstates milit ary to take down saddam hussein this president probably thinks that negotiations are beneath him but i have got news for the bush administration negotiations work and foreign assistance works we need to start relying more on nonmilitary security tools to work out our international differences the other major nuclear threat comes not from foreign countries but from terrorist organizations like al qaed a to address this threat we must secure the nuclear stockpiles that are out there before they get into the hands of terrorists most people agree that the best program to secure nuclear materials is the cooperative threat reduction program or ctr which enlists the department of defense to dismantle nuclear warheads reduce nuclear stockpiles and secure nuclear weapons and materials in the states of the former soviet union ctr is crucial in keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists terrorists know that it would not be difficult to steal material from poorly guarded nuclear plants in russia that is why it is important to increase our funding for ctr and provide funding to extend the program so that other regions of the world can be included last year the cooperative threat reduction program received only 409 million from the defense budget and the department of defense did not even use all of this money we should triple or quadruple our funds and our efforts for ctr in the fiscal year 2006 budget and we should extend this vital program to other countries where nuclear materials are not safely guarded countries like iran north korea libya and pakistan instead of continuing down our current path i believe we must pursue a new national smarter security strategy that i call smart security which is a sensible multilateral american response to terrorism for the 21st century i have also introduced h con res 35 legislation that would pursue a smarter strategy for rebuilding iraq twentyeight of my house colleagues have joined me in offering this important legislation the immoral and illconceived war in iraq has already claimed the lives of nearly 1 500 american troops another 11 000 have been gravely wounded as a result of this war and the 150 000 soldiers that remain in iraq are sitting ducks sitting ducks for iraqs growinginsurgency i am sure that many of these soldiers understand what our president does not that the military option is not working yet the president and his administration refuse to consider alternatives to the way we are handling the situation in iraq think about the good that could be accomplished if even a fraction of the billions that have been spent on military operations were instead spent on nonmilitary security we could help secure iraq by rebuilding schools so that their children could learn constructing new water processing plants so that the iraqi people could have clean water to drink and building new roads so that citizens can travel safely from one city to another our assistance should not end there if we want to be truly smart about how we rebuild iraq we also need to bring nongovernmental organizations and humanitarian agencies into this country to help create a robust civil society and ensure that iraqs economic

not part of their business plan the issue of switching from mtbe to ethanol was something that was known a year and a half ago or more and the decision they knew it they could prepare for it they wanted it to happen and they did not make the preparations to make that switchover as americans struggle with 73 barrels of oil and gas prices that could reach 4 a gallon in the coming months we have

have to be terrorism it could be negotiations on a trade deal anything that will help foreign intelligence you can get one of these roving wiretaps so you are starting off without probable cause of a

i trained 5 years in general surgery and then another 3 years in thoracic surgery to become a cardiothoracic surgeon current law only provides loan deferment for 3 years for certain medical
