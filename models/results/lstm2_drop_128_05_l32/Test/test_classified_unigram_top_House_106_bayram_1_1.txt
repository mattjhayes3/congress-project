least one good thing about that in the last few weeks many hmos have announced double digit premium increases because in my opinion they have not done such a great job in cost containment and their premiums have been loss leaders for years but you can be sure that if the patients bill of rights had passed last year they would be blaming us now for their skyrocketing premiums and by the way how many of their ceos are taking pay cuts from their multimillion dollar salaries as they are raising their premiums this year before discussing how i think congress will deal with this issue this year it is important to understand why passage of hmo reform legislation is so important i will bet that every member of congress has heard from constituents describing their own hmo horror story we have all seen headlines like hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs or exnew yorker is told get castrated so we can save dollars or how about this headline what his parents didnt know about hmos may have killed this baby consider the 29yearold cancer patient whose hmo would not pay for his treatments the hmo case manager told him instead to hold a fundraiser a fundraiser well i certainly hope that campaign finance reform will not stymie this mans efforts to get his cancer treatment during congressional hearings two years ago before the committee on commerce we heard testimony from alan demeurers who lost his wife christy to breast cancer when a specialist at ucla recommended that she undergo a bone marrow transplant her hmo leaned on ucla to change its medical opinion who knows whether christy would be with her two children today had her hmo not interfered with her doctorpatient relationship other plans have placed ridiculous burdens on those seeking emergency care ask jacqueline lee how bad this can be in the summer of 1996 she was hiking in the shenandoah mountains when she fell off a 40foot cliff she fractured her skull her arm her pelvis she was semicomatose she was airlifted to the local hospital and treated now my colleagues will not believe this her hmo refused to pay for the services because she had failed to get preauthorization i want to ask my colleagues what was she supposed to do know that she was going to fall off a cliff or maybe as she was laying at the base of that 40foot cliff semicomatose with her nonbroken arm she could pull a cellular phone out of her pocket and phone a 1800 number saying i need to get to the emergency room colleagues there are countless other examples how about the doctor who was treating a drowning victim a little 6yearold boy this physician told me that this little boy had been in the icu for just a few hours was hooked up to a ventilator they were doing everything they could to save his life but it did not look very promising as this physician and the little boys parents were standing around the bedside just a few hours after admission to the icu the phone rings it is the hmo case manager well how is this little boys condition it is pretty critical well if it is so dismal have you thought about sending him home on home ventilation think about that we are fighting to save this little boys life and a few hours after admission the hmo is suggesting send him home on home ventilation so that we can save a few dollars how about the hmos that refuse to cover cleft lip and cleft palate surgery saying that these are cosmetic how about plans that threaten action against doctors who tell their patients about all of their medical options not just the cheap ones that the plan will provide how about hmos manipulating the term medically necessary to avoid covering costly procedures because our friends our neighbors our fellow workers or our own families have had these types of experiences countless polls show that people want congress to pass managed care reform legislation this year a recent kaiser family foundation survey found that 78 percent of voters support managed care reform and a similar percentage support allowing consumers to go to court to sue their health plans if their health plans are guilty of malpractice but no public opinion poll can convey the depth of emotion on this issue except the way movie audiences around the country spontaneously clapped and cheered helen hunts obscenitylaced description of her hmo in the oscarwinning movie as good as it gets audiences across the country responded to her plight because they saw the same things happening to their families their friends their fellow workers now the industry responds well these cases that you have talked about they are all just anecdotes well to paraphrase shakespeare hath not these anecdotes these hmo victims hath not these anecdotes hands organs senses passions the same as a hmo apologist and if you prick these anecdotes do they not bleed if you tickle those anecdotes do they not laugh and if you cut short their care for profits might they not die last year i and some others crossed party lines to push for passage of the patients bill of rights this is a good bill it would have done a lot to deal with the end of the constant stream of hmo abuses similar to the ones i have talked about it contained for example strong language ensuring that health plans pay for emergency care think of the plight of james adams age 6 months at 3 30 in the morning his mother lamona found him hot panting moaning his temperature was 104 degrees lamona phoned her hmo and was told to take little jimmy to the scottish rite hospital quote that is the only hospital i can send you to said the hmo reviewer how do i get there lamona asked i dont know the nurse said im not good at directions well about 20 miles into their ride little jimmys parents passed emory university hospital a renowned pediatric center then they passed georgia baptist and grady memorial but they did not have permission to stop there and so they drove on they had 22 more miles to travel to get to scottish rite hospital and while searching for scottish rite james heart stopped there is a scene in the recent movie civil action showing a mother and a father in a car on the side of the road administering cpr to their child think of little jimmy adams when you see that scene well lamona eventually got jimmy to the hospital but because he had had an arrest it looked like he was going to die jimmy was a tough little guy though and despite his cardiac arrest due to the delay in treatment by his hmo me survived however the doctors taking care of little jimmy had to amputate both his hands and both his feet because of gangrene related to the arrest all of this is documented in the book health against wealth as the details of baby james hmos methods emerged it became clear that the margins of safety in hmos can be razor thin maybe as thin as the scalpel that amputated jimmys hands and feet think of the dilemma an hmo places on a mother struggling to make ends meet in lamonas situation if she takes her child to the nearest emergency room she could be at risk for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in uncovered charges or she could hope that her childs condition will not get worse as they drive past other hospitals that additional 22 miles to get to the nearest er authorized by that hmo a strong hmo reform bill would ensure that consumers do not have to make that type of potentially disastrous choice last year we had support from consumer groups and from a number of nonprofit health plans calling for federal legislation these health plans and consumer groups wrote together we are seeking to address problems that have led to a decline in consumer confidence and trust in health plans we believe that thoughtfully designed health plan standards will help to restore confidence and ensure needed protection and noting that they already made extensive efforts to improve the quality of their care the chief executive officer of one of these plans said we intend to insist on even higher standards of behavior within our own industry and we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result let me repeat that the ceo of one of the countrys largest hmos said we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result so in recognition of the problems in managed care these three managed care plans along with consumer groups got together and endorsed nationally enforceable standards things like guaranteeing access to appropriate services providing people with a choice of health plans ensuring the confidentiality of medical records protecting the continuity of care providing consumers with relevant information covering emergency care banning gag rules well i am sad to say that despite strong public support to correct problems like these and the support of many responsible managed care plans the legislation stalled in washington last year that is truly unfortunate since the problem demands federal action 0 historically state insurance commissioners have done a good job of monitoring the performance of the health plans in their states but federal law puts most hmos beyond the reach of state regulations how is this possible more than two decades ago congress passed the employee retirement income security act which i will refer to as erisa in order to provide some uniformity for pension plans in dealing with different state laws health plans were included in erisa almost as an afterthought but the result has been a gaping regulatory loophole for selfinsured plans under erisa and even more alarming is the fact that this lack of effective regulation is coupled with an immunity from liability for negligent actions now personal responsibility has been a watchword for this republican congress and this issue should be no different health plans that recklessly deny needed medical service should be made to answer for their conduct laws that shield them from their responsibility only encourage hmos to cut corners congress created this erisa loophole and congress should fix it think for a moment about buying a car i often hear from opponents to this legislation well this managed care legislation this could lead to socialized medicine but think about buying a car federal laws ensure that cars have horns brakes and headlights yet despite these minimum standards we do not have a nationalized auto industry instead consumers have lots of choices but they know that whatever car they buy that car has to meet certain minimum safety standards one does not buy safety a la carte the same notion of basic protections and standards should in my opinion apply to health plans consumer protections will not lead to socialized medicine any more than requiring seat belts has led to a nationalized auto industry in a free market these minimum standards set a level playing field that allows competition to flourish let me share some thoughts on how i think this issue will evolve in the coming months as we know we came close to passing the patients bill of rights last year already however i see signs that a partisan fight could break out again this year while i continue to support the patients bill of rights and i wish it had passed i do not want us to get hung up on or let reform die on the alter of partisanship like the opponents to the legislation used last year so i decided not to cosponsor the patients bill of rights this year when the gentleman from michigan introduces it instead i am going to introduce my own bill probably next week while my bill will keep the best features of the patients bill of rights it will also eliminate some of the provisions that would add regulatory burdens on health plans without really adding much in the way of increased patient safety in addition my bill will have a new formulation on the issue of health plan liability i continue to believe that health plans which make negligent medical decisions should be accountable for their actions but winning a lawsuit is little consolation to a family who has lost a loved one the best hmo bill will ensure that health care is delivered when it is needed and to encourage that the bill which i will drop next week will provide for both an internal and an external appeals process but unlike last years patient protection act the external review will be binding on the plan it could be requested by either the patient or the health plan the review would be done by an independent panel of medical experts do external appeals work a recent review in new york shows that half of all internal appeals are decided in favor of the patient but that also means that half of the time the hmos decisions are upheld the important thing is to get the proper treatment for the patient in a timely way not necessarily to end the post mortem in a court so i will propose that where there is a dispute on denial of care either the patient or the hmo can take this dispute to an independent peer panel for a binding decision if the plan follows that decision there could not be punitive damages against the hmo since there can be no malice if they bind themselves to the decision of an independent panel of experts i suspect that aetna today wishes they had had an independent peer panel available even with a binding decision on care when it denied care to david goodrich last week a california jury handed down a verdict with 116 million in punitive damages to david goodrichs wife teresa if aetna or the goodriches had had the ability to send that denial of care to an external review they could have avoided the courtroom but more importantly david goodrich might be alive today that is why my plan should be attractive to both sides of the aisle consumers get a reliable and quick external appeals process which will help them get the care they need they can go to court to collect economic damages or lost wages future medical care but if the plan follows the external reviews decision the patient cannot sue for punitive damages hmos whose greatest fear is of a 50 or a 100 million punitive damage award can shield themselves from those astronomic awards but only if they follow the recommendations of an independent review panel which is free to make its own decision about what care is medically necessary as long as there is not a specific exclusion of coverage of a benefit i e a plan says up front to an enrollee we do not cover liver transplants i have shared this approach with a number of my colleagues as well as consumer groups businesses health plans i have been encouraged by the positive responses that i have received i think this could be the basis for the bipartisan solution to this problem in fact i recently spoke with the ceo of a large blue cross plan who confided to me that his organization is already implementing virtually all of the recommendations of the presidents health care quality advisory commission at little or no cost probably no premium increase but the one part of the health care debate that concerns him is the issue of liability he indicated that shielding plans from punitive damages when they follow an external review body would strike an appropriate balance passage of real patient protection legislation is going to require a lot of hard work dedication and seeking a consensus and a compromise my new bill represents an effort to break through the partisan gridlock that we saw last year and to move this issue forward and get a solution signed into law i hope that my colleagues will sign on as original cosponsors to the managed care reform act of 1999 if members have any questions about parts of this bill or if they want to sign on please give my office a phone call"]], "top_unsure": [[0.002582252025604248, 0.49741774797439575,

others much more than we thought he said no to proposals that would have canceled environmental reviews on timber sales where logging could threaten wildlife he said no to a proposal to build a road through the middle of a migratory bird refuge a place that is supposed to be wilderness he said no to proposals that would have required uneconomical logging that would have permanent damage to one of our most pristine forests he said no to proposals that would have barred epa from trying to improve air quality in our national parks because al gore took a firm stand those proposals were blocked he has stood with us when we blocked efforts to roll back 25 years of work on cleaning up our rivers he stood with us when we blocked efforts that would have prohibited epa from doing more to clean up the air that we all breathe he stood with us on protecting childrens health from asthma caused by airborne pollution illness caused by food poisoning and pesticide poisoning permanent damage caused by toxic wastes let loose in the environment the vice president stood with us on all those issues the american people want clean air and water they want freedom from pollution and contamination they want protection of our beautiful public lands and forests and they want protection for our wildlife al gore wants them too and he wants all of them to have them as well he is willing to stand up and fight

or not the justice department violated the law itself in filing the lawsuit last year for the first time that i have ever recalled justice asked the congress for money to file a specific lawsuit the congress said no the money was denied justice then secretly went to three agencies and said give us the money to file this lawsuit they said wait a minute where is your authority for that they said well look at section 109 of the 1995 state commercejustice bill where it says that agencies can reimburse the justice department for representing them in court and they dragged the money out of those agencies and filed this lawsuit well that statute that they are talking about is the crux of what we are h50 talking about here today that statute merely says that the government can be represented in court when it is sued that was the intent of the congress no to be the suer no one told the congress that they had done this we had to find it out on our own and we did so the department of justice the place supposedly where the nations morals are protected the place where moral authority resides in this government if anywhere itself is the one that is thwarting the will of the congress that is twisting words for its own purposes that is clearly violating the intent of the congress in passing the act in the first place why was it passed in the first place the government was sued a huge multibillion dollar suit by the contractor for the navy department when we canceled the a12 aircraft contract in 1995 justice says please congress help us allow the defense department to pay us back for representing them in defending this lawsuit and we said we think that is a legitimate purpose and we wrote it into our bill that is the statute they are trying to use we all know my colleagues know that that statute is for defending the government not suing willynilly why because we provided in this bill 147 million for them to bring lawsuits 1 034 lawyers we hire there to file lawsuits we are paying those lawyers to file lawsuits this statute is for defending the government not suing and yet they would have us believe that this great moral authority at the justice department is right i say to my colleagues the question here is not the merits of the lawsuit or any other lawsuit the question here is the merits of the morality at the justice department does the end justify the means

colleagues reject the justice departments grab of other agencies money but more importantly the justice departments seizure of power away from the congress never was it intended in this congress in the passage of this statute that it was to be funding lawsuits filed by the government no one ever anticipated that or thought about it when we passed the act the intent of the congress is being clarified in our bill and that is this statute is for defensive purposes only reject the waxman amendment that would legitimize and reward a justice department that has seized your prerogative and is

effort during world war h we ended up making some unfortunate decisions perhaps only history will judge but the recent evidence suggests that we did not have to make as much of an enemy of mao tsetung and the communists this tragic miscalculation came into fore during the korean war when general macarthur defied president truman and enlarged the conflict and ultimately cost thousands of united states lives that was unnecessary at the time of course in the well of this congress macarthur was viewed as a hero and truman was vilified history has shown that president truman was in fact a visionary in a number of respects one of our greatest presidents praised by no one less than ronald reagan but we have seen the ebb and flow on this floor where congress simply has not exercised proper perspective we saw where richard nixon who was characterized during his early career as a red baiter as someone who was against the communist chinese yet he was able during his presidency one of the most enduring and lasting contributions was to swing the balance of power towards a more strategic alliance with china and that hastened the collapse of the former soviet union we have seen china behave as a nation of what appears to be to us in excess the great leap forward costing millions of lives of their own people the cultural revolution of the seventies the current turmoil that is in this context is perhaps a little more understandable but one thing is very clear that we are seeing unprecedented access to the chinese people more and more educated abroad particularly in the united states even with the internet access it is transforming the internal dynamics of china the united states does not have to sit back helplessly as we look at forces in china but nonetheless it seems to me important that we do not use heavyhanded clumsy behavior assuming that the united states can isolate china and make it bend to our dictates it is important that we use trade and our economic relationship as tools there is no turning back our history both of the united states and of the west in general has been mixed with the chinese and there is much to make them apprehensive but the united states has paid a heavy price for miscalculating during world war ii during the korean war and vietnam the united states and china spies on each other continuously but we really do not know each other very well i am hopeful that this week on this floor congress will reject the notion that we ought not to treat china as we do 180 other countries with normal trade relations because if we

district an even more important portal for pacific rim trade with 20 percent of the worids population china is an appealing market it behooves us to work diligently and intelligently to open that market to unitedstates sellers the other hand carries many pitfalls chinas track record in meeting its obligations under international agreements is not good china is the only remaining communist superpower china has stolen our nuclear secrets and threatens stability in asia with her belligerence towards taiwan and others we ignore that reality at our own peril last year i voted against a oneyear extension of chinas most favored nation status based on two criteria the united states maintains a multibilliondollar trade deficit with china and has for years and china has repeatedly demonstrated an aggressive military stance that includes stealing our most important nuclear secrets at the beginning of this debate i was not automatically against chinas entry into the world trade organization but i did have some very serious concerns wto membership carries more protection for the united states than does most favored nation status mfn has been a oneway street it was a unilateral decision on our part to allow china access to our markets with no reciprocal opening on chinas behalf wto is more of a twoway street china must meet and maintain certain opendoor criteria to remain in the wto our trade with china historically has been a oneway street in 1990 our trade deficit with china stood at 10 4 billion by 1998 that deficit had climbed to 56 9 billion it is estimated our trade deficit with china in 1999 will be 66 4 billion chinas entry into wto and the ratification of the unitedstates china trade agreement can ease that deficit but only if the agreement has teeth i believe the wto process has those teeth in 1992 china and the unitedstates signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade access china has violated it many times in 1992 we also struck a deal with china to protect intellectual property including copyrights on unitedstates products today unitedstates copyrights for motion pictures and software in china are still being stolen by chinese companies a situation that results in the loss of billions of dollars and many thousands of american jobs chinese noncompliance has forced us to threaten trade sanctions several times on the national security front china was continuing a systematic raid on the designs of our most sophisticated thermonuclear weapons at the same time that it was modernizing and pretending to normalize relations with the unitedstates among the stolen designs was information on the neutron bomb which to date no nation has opted to deploy and hopefully no one will even though china has been caught redhanded it continues to deny its espionage meanwhile it continues to showcase its belligerency by transferring sensitive missile technology to north korea and by repeatedly threatening to attack taiwan the unitedstates china agreement can have positive consequences for the unitedstates china and indeed the entire world the agreement will force china to open its markets to unitedstates goods and services which will result in a lowering of the trade deficit it could wean china from its passion for subsidies and govemment interference in its industries it could educate the chinese on the rule of law as opposed to its current system of rule by the whim of its leaders it could also hasten the spread of democracy within her borders each time a country has opened its economic markets an open market of ideas has followed but we must step carefully we must not let our desire to access chinas markets to blind us to chinas distaste for democracy her threat to our national security and

night those protections are in the bill only because i and other members of congress withheld our support until every t was dotted by working behind the scenes we were able to force concessions that make this agreement a better deal for american businesses american workers and for those who support greater human rights for the chinese people last night a bipartisan provision was incorporated into the bill that makes it easier for us to monitor chinas trade compliance and act if need be that provision builds on provisions in the world trade organization agreement that allows us to continue to treat china as a communist economy thats important because our safeguards and antidumping countermeasures are more stringent for communist economies than it is for capitalist countries in addition the revised bill continues congress allimportant right to debate and vote on chinas human rights practices and international behavior each year the european union signed its wto agreement with china on

of the states and on behalf of this program which provides vital services for lowincome americans to meet their heating and cooling needs in the different parts of the country one point i would make first would be it is fine to say many states are running a surplus but are they running a surplus because they have met all their needs and obligations or are they running a surplus because of cuts in programs that serve many of these same people that is one point the second point is have we done away with all of the unfunded mandates there are so many things that the federal government requires of our states which do not have federal dollars attached and now we are going to impose essentially here a new mandate by saying if they want to participate in this program they have to put up 25 percent of the money that i think is very problematic it is particularly problematic logistically for many states my state legislature is about to adjourn having completed the budget they do not know about this they have not anticipated it so i guess next winter unless we have an emergency session of the legislature to come up with more money in order to meet this match oregonians will not get this lowincome weatherization assistance states are also of course by law most states are required to have balanced budgets they have had balanced budgets for decades that is why in fact i was a very early person on this side to support a balanced budget amendment for the united states and we are headed towards a balanced budget supposedly a theoretical surplus here so what are we doing why are we gouging the states now why are we hitting at the little people and the lowincome weatherization this is something that is going to cause a lot of disruptions in the next year yes some states could probably accommodate it many will not be able to logistically many may not be able to financially i really believe that this is an illintentioned amendmen it has not come from the authorizinf committee it is being proposed by the committee on appropriations and if this is meritorious it should go back to the committee on commerce and they should have a discussion in making changes in the authorization for this program"], [0.03882363438606262, 0.4611763656139374, 1, "i think it is important for us to recognize what is happening here and to gauge the implications of it to understand them and all of their ramifications because they are broad and deep first of all by striking this language 9 million which is appropriated in this bill to the department of the interior will now be spent by the army corps of engineers the department of the interior will simply be a passthrough the department of the interior will have no say whatsoever in how that money is spent it will be spent only by the army corps of engineers for their purposes that is contrary to everything that this congress has done up to this point with regard to this project our chairman has just outlined very carefully and accurately some of the profound difficulties that will ensue as a result of the striking of this language we have here a national resource the everglades are half owned by the united states government for all the people of the country they arethat half of the everglades is administered by the department of the interior by striking this language the department of the interior will have no say whatsoever in how this 9 million appropriated in this bill is to be spent the foundation which has been laid very very carefully over a long period of time and which has involved the appropriation and expenditure of several billion dollars so far is undermined by the striking of this language what we have had up to now is a cooperative working relationship between the state of florida the south florida water management district the army corps of engineers and the united states department of the interior the united states department of the interior is involved here because of the fact that we have a number of ecosystems in those everglades which are administered by the department of the interior and appropriately so striking this language is going to do extreme damage to the foundation that has been laid the confidence that has been had by these relating agencies in working together that confidence will no longer exist the people around the country who have watched this enterprise go forward and they too have watched it with confidence because of the cooperation that has been had between the various agencies many people around the country are going to now withdraw that confidence they are going to be very skeptica l about what is going to happen with regard to the everglades all of the environmental protection that is important in the everglades restoration is now placed in jeopardy the 68 threatened and endangered species that are in the everglades now will be increasingly endangered because their manager their overseer the department of the interior will no longer be active i think it is important finally that the members here understand what is being done this is technically accurate but it is wholly mischievous it is going to result in substantial damage we will have to immediately find ways to correct the damage which has been done by the striking of this language"], [0.04373198747634888, 0.4562680125236511, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume to simply suggest to my colleague from florida that i would be very surprised if there was going to be a rush within the state legislatures of america to increase the definition of what is a felonious quantity of drugs to allow drug dealers and drug users to remain in the public schools i do not think that is what most school board members i do not think that is what most principals and teachers are looking for i have no quarrel with the philosophical objections of my friends on the other side that is something that we deal with in this chamber on a regular basis i would simply urge them to revisit this issue and take a look and search their hearts and make a determination if they could see their way clear to voting for an amendment that will take a positive step forward from removing dangerous drugs from the public schools this is an opportunity to do it i have submitted the amendment for that purpose i ask for an aye vote on the amendment i yield back
