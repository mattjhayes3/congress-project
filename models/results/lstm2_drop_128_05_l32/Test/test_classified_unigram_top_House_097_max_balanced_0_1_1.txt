this house last year it is a corrective amendment to change a very substantial disagreement of jurisdiction between osha and msha i offered this amendment last year to the labor department appropriation bill to provide needed regulatory relief to a variety of small businesses regulated presently byp the mine safety and health administration the purpose of my amendment was to deny funcl to msha to enforce its inflexible rules and regulations against certain industriesnamely the sand gravel crushed stone clay and colloidal phosphate industriesand thereby effect their transfer to the regulatory jurisdiction of osha let me stress that these industries were not to be left unregulated but would have been transferred at their request to osha which has certainly not been traditionally considered a patsy for the business community this amendment was subsequently adopted by the house and later added by the senate to the continuing resolution which would fund msha for fiscal year 1981 unfortunately during the fight over the congressional pay raise issue the amendment was lost along with a hundred other amendments and therefore did not become law decpite the overwhelming congressional supportboth in the house and in the senate i am today offering this amendment my amendment accomplishes the objectives of a bill currently cosponsored by 153 members of this body h r 1603 h r 1603 and other similar bills have languished in the health and safety subcommittee of the education and labor committee in the 96th congress and now in the 97th congress despite the great support this legislation has from many many members of congress congressmen marlenee and barnardthe principal sponsors of h r 1603 join me in urging your support for my amendment which is necessitated because of inaction by the committee having jurisdiction over h r 1603 two years ago the appropriations committee included language to deny msha funds to enforce complicated and in many instances irrelevant training requirements against these same industries i am pleased to note that prohibition has been continued in the proposal pending before the house today while our action on the training requirements has helped these industries there is still a desperate need for further congressional action my amendment makes it clear that we intend for osha to exercise jurisdiction over not only training of employees working in these industfies but have total responsibility for assuring a safe and healthful workplace the industries i am seeking to have transferred from msha to osha were made subject to the mine safety and health act by the amendments that the congress enacted in 1977 few of us recognized at that time that we were imposing sophisticated regulations designed for large and highly technical operations on small businesses which are located in virtually every community in our country the sand gravel and crushed stone industries the two largest industries affected by the amendment have an average number of employees per operation of 7 and 11 respectively the 1977 act has created continuing confrontations between these small businesses and the federal government this adversary relationship is to no ones benefit the transfer proposed in my amendment will restore a cooperative relationship between federal safety and health experts and the industries for the benefit of the workers the industries which would be transferred are not hazardous industries as their current safety records demonstrate and our acceptance therefore of this amendment will not provide any less safety and health protection to their employees some of my colleagues have suggested that the relief sought by these industries can be administratively accomplished by the mine safety and health administration to date the only significant administrative relief and possibly all that is available under the constraints of the act has come from the socalled compliance assistance visit program which allows msha inspectors to examine an oper ation that has been closed due to seasonal conditions and provide a citation and penalty free inspection prior to its reopening this limited and courtesy inspection is in sharp contrast to oshas program where an operator can request such an inspection at any time the problem is that the 1977 mine safety amendments act leaves the secretary of labor with very little flexibility in providing such relief thus underscoring the necessity for passage of my amendment it is regrettable that this serious regulatory problem which has been the subject of 21 days of hearings in the last congress must be addressed by means of an appropriations rider here today hopefully passage of my amendment will force full house consideration of legislationspecifically h r 1603in the near future to make permanent the changes my amendment would make here today for 1982 what is the actual effect of my amendment my amendment simply provides that the regulation of persons engaged in the surface mining of stone clay colloidal phosphate sand or gravel or with respect to any person engaged in construction activities on the surface area of any coal or other mine for safety purposes is transferred from msha to osha one question often asked about this amendment is does the msha amendment create a void in federal enforcement of safety and health standards over the surface mining of sand gravel stone clay colloidal phosphate as well as surface mining construction no osha under the occupational safety and health act has jurisdiction over these mines osha by its terms applies to all employers engaged in a business affecting comoctober 6 1 981 coi merce title 29 united states code section 652 5 thus osha legally covers mines which are also covered under the mine and safety and health act of 1977 additionally the drafters of osha realized that there was the potential problem of dual regulation thus they included in the act a deferral provision title 29 united states code section 653 b 1 it provides that where another federal agency exercises its own statutory authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety or health standards then osha will not apply the legislative history of osha shows that the key factor triggering deferral is the exercise of another agencys statutory authority over them in three separate court cases three courts of appeals in our country which incidently are the courts next in authority to the unitedstates supreme court it was held that osha has jurisdiction when any other agency for example federal railroad administration msha et ceterais deprived of their jurisdiction the appropriations limitation has the effect of not providing funding for fiscal year 1982 for the exercise of mshas statutory authority over the surface mines described in the pending amendment thus there will be no exercise of statutory authority by msha the effect of this nonexercise under section 4 b 1 of oshatitle 29 united states code section 653 b 1 thus triggers by operation of existing law the responsibility of osha to assume enforcement activity over the described surface mines let me talk for a minute about the construction industry the construction industry was and still is specifically under osha jurisdiction for safety and health in fact in 1973 the construction industry initiated the call for a single standard separate and apart from the general industry osha standards so that the specific concerns of the construction industry could be adequately addressed this was done on the basis of a study which pointed out the shortcomings overlaps and voids between the general industry and the construction series of osha standards this step published in the federal register in 1979 is an example of longterm cooperation between the construction industry and osha and dedication to a mutual goalsafety with practicability unfortunately those construction contractors worfring on a suirface mine sites are considered to be miners and fall under mshas rules and regulations these socalled miners may be constructing a scale house a garage a new shop building or a structure to house a processing plant biut under the 1977 mine safety and health act they are considered miners ajid they are now subject to rules and regulations established for miners in addition to construction rufles and regulations found under osha let me give you a specific example a construction firm is planning on building a highway along the rightofway the contractor negotiates with a farmer or a rancher for the purchase of stone sand or gravel from a borrow pit on his property suddenly the farmer has become a mineowner and the contractor has become a mine operator this is the result of the msha ruling one day the contractor may greet an osha compliance officer performing an inspection of the site the next day he may find an msha enforcement officer at the gate neither operate under the same rules nor do they use the same or cven similar citations of penalties the contractor must take time from his schedule to accompany each of these federal officials during their inspections or have one of his supervisors do so in addition the contractor must also permit theemployee representative to join the entourageall at the contractors expense this situation is clearly absurd if we are truly serious about budget cuts and cutting down on truly excess federal expenditures then we should be saying you cannot send two inspectors to the same jobsite because there is no reason to pay two people to do one job there is an interagency agreement between the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration which should reduce some of the existing problems however all such memorandums of understanding have a degree of fragility about them in that they commit only those signatory to the document nnd for an unspecified period furthir the agreement reclassifies as mining some operations which have traditionally been regarded as construction it suggests that whenever a construction contractor uses equipment to process or size material which he alone is responsible for excavating he must be covered by the requirements of msha compelling the contractor to provide 24 hours of superfluous training prior to 1 ounce of productive effort from his work force again this cost spiral is all too obvious one construction industry group surveyed its members to get some idea of the cost impact of msha on the construction industry the most conservative estimates of cost impact of msha on the nations highway program place the increase at 1 percent that 1 percent comes to 300 million per year this is only a part of the problem what about the building contractors who purchase their stone sand gravel aggregates cement concrete brick and so forth from suppliers members of the construction industry report that the~r material suppliers costs would increase anywhere from 5 to 10 percent these increases are completely unnecessary one member of the industry stated if the huge msha staff went to the underground mines to work at the mining problem instead of cluttering up the surface landscape with wasteful duplicative efforts we would all benefit now i would like to address those who say that nsha is doing a terrific job and it is changing its waysbecoming more and more receptive i say that msha has not turned over a new leaf the agency and its supporters are making inaccurate statements about its socalled new look that the situations brought to our attention by constituents with stone sand gravel and clay operations as well as surface construction activities have not been resolved conditions have not improved to any appreciable degree during the 96th congress hearings were held on this issue in the house and despite consistent overwhelming testimony from all elements of the noncoalmining industrythese hearings are slated to continue ad finitum with the committee in the house showing no inclination to take action toward resolving the injustices found not just in the administration of the actbut in the act itself certainly there is always need in every industry and service to continually improve safety and health conditions but the policeman approach of msha is not the answer it appears methods of aggravation are the product not constructive efforts to better safety it is now time to resolve this matterif at least only for a year the senate subcommittee on labor has voted out s 351 which would authorize this change in the msha legislation the senate has also indicated that they will include my amendment in their version of the laborhealth education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1982 i urge support for this amendment to remove the stone clay sand gravel and surface mining construction from the heavy foot of msha to osha i urge the support of my colleagues let msha be directly and

importance that i have for the work at hand i think it is extremely important in fact that is the reason i saw fit to vote against the resolution i think the resolution is very craftily crafted and i compliment the leadership of the rules committe for having put together as good a package as i think he could have put together under the circumstances that he is dealing with and i am not critical of my good friend the chairman or any of the members of the rules committee for having done it except that i do feel that the mistake that was made if indeed it is a mistake is not considering the baited breath which you can feel around the country concerning the budget resolution which this house and the other body must adopt i feel a greater sense of urgency as far as time is concerned i guess than most people do in getting this done i do feel that we will have done a deed which we should have learned 3 or 4 years ago when this budget process took approximately 2 weeks to finish because of the fact that we were dealing with line item amendments i am sorry to tell the members that there are several of these amendments i am toldand i have not had a chance to look at them allbut i am told that there are several of these amendments which are line item amendments and i thought everybody agreed that a line item amendment should be taken care of in the appropriations process or in the authorization process and not in the budgetary process i can foresee a scenario which believe me i hope will not happen i can foresee that there will be quite a few of these amendments adopted to category b substitutes and when we finally end up with all of the category b substitutes having been perfected that we will have three monstrosities on our hands and no way to do anything about them that is another reason why i asked and it was agreedwhat i asked that there be a motion to recommit in this resolution a motion to recommit is usually thought of as a weapon of a minority i did not ask for the motion to recommit for that reason i asked for it because i can foresee with all of these amendments being offered we could have three nunstrosities and we would have no vehicle whatsoever to put before the house a resolution which would be adopted i think it is absolutely imperative that we adopt something and i guess probably i am going to vote for whatever the last resolution is if none has been adopted before because it is so necessary so important to this country that something get out of this house that we can send to conference with the other body but i would like to have it be as good a document as we possibly can get i can imagine that if we put out the kind of hounddog that i can foresee that the money markets around the country and indeed around the world will take one look at it and hold their noses and probably do some terrible things to the interest rate after all my colleagues the bottom line of this exercise has got to be to get that interest rate down if we do not do that whether or not my colleagues have been able to offer all of the amendments that they wanted is really beside the point the bottom line is that interest rate the bottom line is the prosperity of this country i am afraid we are fooling around with it to a point that i just cannot support so i probably will vote for the resolution i am going to do it not because i ike it and you know that but i am going to do it because i feel it is absolutely necessary that we get on with this job that we do the work this is the only vehicle that we have to get it done so when the time comes i will very reluctantly vote for this resolution i do wish to reiterate however that i think that the time will come maybe in 1 week 2 weeks or 3 weeks when we will wish very fervently we had done something entirely different"], [0.0004679858684539795, 0.499532014131546, 1, "i would like to take this opportunity to note the passage of an important amendment yesterday offered y representative cooper evans of iowa to the environmental research development and demonstration act of 1983 the amendment authorized the senior environmental employment program this program gets at the heart of two problems this nation faces first we need more workers to enforce and reessional record extensions of remarks search our environmental policies this problem did not come with the reagan administration when the senior environmental employment program was first implemented in 1978 state and local environmental offices cited a need for more employees i might add that this administrations view that there is no need for more environmental employeesin fact that fewer employees can do the job bettersomewhat baffles me nevertheless the job of protecting our environment is an enormous one and the use of senior employees can help get it done the second problem the senior environmental employment program can help to alleviate is the growing numbers of unemployed senior citizens the population of people over the age of 65 is steadily rising and so is poverty boredom and disillusionment among our nations elderly this program is an excellent opportunity for senior citizens to pursue their interests in environmental protection and make a valuable contribution to this nations future e"], [0.0005806982517242432, 0.49941930174827576, 1, "i too regret that the minority leader has left he asked why we are taking the time to pass this resolution and the answer is very simple as long as the president of the united states continues to scare older people we have to take some time to reassure them the president said that he wanted the pro gram abolished the gentleman from connecticut cited an experience that many of us have had the people who work on this program are frightened the people who benefit from the work of the program are frightened perhaps they should not take the president seriously perhaps the minority leader is right to chide us for assuming that when the president says he is out to abolish a program he means it but how are older people to kn ow this maybe we could work out a system maybe when the president says he is going to abolish a program but is only kidding he could wink or wave or in some other way communicate the fact that he is not serious but for now as long as the president says he wants to abolish a program leaves it out of the budget and objects to putting it back into the urgent supplemental please do not think that the elderly people of this country are being hypersensitive when they think the program may be in danger in fact it is a program which is a superb one it leverages public dollars we get work out of the senior citizens on behalf of nutrition programs home care programs and other programs far beyond what we could buy in an open market situation not only that it appears to be very well run i made a point of asking because we are told all the time that these programs have to be cut to do away with fraud waste and inefficiency if there was fraud of wante here as a member of the select committee on aging at several hearings i have asked labor department officials i have asked state officials if they know of abuse in this program and no one has alleged any incidents of abuse or fraud or waste so we have a program where for ideological reasons the president proposed to wipe out we think it is important to give reassurance to people that it will not be abolished i am sorry that the minority leader thinks it is a poor use of our time but i hope that he would ask the president not needlessly to set those fires and we would not have to take the time on the house floor to put them out"], [0.000582575798034668, 0.5005825757980347, 1, "i thank the gentleman from south dakota for yielding i desire to ask

that they might support but i think the gentleman has pointed out something that needs to be pointed out we have a budget that we are trying to meet the gentleman from iowa offered an amendment to cut a billion dollars out of this farm program in order to meet that budget i think it is im~portant that we recognize that and we do not go willynilly adding costs to programs unless we can clearly justify those costs in my opinion this increase is not justified i have nothing against the puerto rican people i know they are beautiful people i certainly support them but there are dif erences as the gentleman has pointed out there are already differences in how you qualify the fact is the puerto rican people do not pay income taxes as do the rest of the citizens of the continental united states there are differences i think we should recognize those differences very clearly i have a letter from a sister who has served in puerto rico from my dish 769 3 trict i would like to read two or three sentences having worked on the island for 5 years i know that 60 percent of the people there do not need food stamps this handout has been a curse to the people and a ripoff of the united states

is that that kind of study could ultimately cost 10 to 15 million there is a necessity within the department of housing and urban development for another 15 million which is the base or core housing
