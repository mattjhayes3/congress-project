unitedstates history as part of a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a

that is not to say that i think nafta is going to be completely painless i am sympathetic with many of the concerns raised about the agreement unitedstates businesses operate under a blanket of environmental and safety regulations which hamper their ability to compete in the international market i agree that these handicaps need to be recognized and addressed in any trade agreement at the same time i am wary of some of the arguments raised against establishing free trade with mexico the constant harping that nafta will cost this country jobs and slow our future economic growth is completely contrary to our recent experience with trade agreements we have all heard the statistics over the last 5 years since the mexican government unilaterally cut its tariffs on american products united states trade with mexico has exploded and what was a trade deficit has changed into a trade surplus despite this record many opponents claim that if the nafta is passed then united states corporations will move to mexico to take advantage of the lower labor costs well that is happening right now without the assistance of the nafta agreement and if we stop them from moving to mexico theyll move to south korea or the pacific rim instead sticking our heads in the sand and scrapping nafta wont solve the problem of highpriced american labor on the other hand nafta will open up mexicos markets for the kind of capital and manufactured goods in which we are competitive since 1986 when mexico entered gatt united states exports to mexico have tripled creating over 400 000 american jobs over 80 percent of these new jobs are the highwage manufacturing jobs that concern the opponents of nafta signing nafta will create more other opponents to nafta point out that we cannot have balanced trade with mexico because its people living along the united statesmexico border live in substandard housing and earn substandard wages in my mind this observation would seem to support a free trade agreement mexicos people cant improve their conditions and if they have no jobs or income that response also applies to the environmental concerns raised against nafta there is a direct linkage between economic growth and increased environmental performance environmental regulations cost money and mexico cant address its current environment problems without economic growth the perception held by many americans is that mexico is a third world country that has little to offer the united states as a trading partner this perception ignores the reality that mexicos middleclass population is larger than canadas entire population in fact mexico is already our third leading trading partner consuming over 40 billion in american goods each year and providing employment for over 600 000 americans for every impoverished citizen who would gladly workwhether nafta is ratified or notat a 1 a day job along the mexico border there is a middleclass citizen eager to purchase unitedstates goods and services but cant because current mexican tariffs are too high there are two other objections to nafta that i think need to be addressed first is the issue of taxes under this agreement 2 5 billion worth of tariffsthat is taxes on american consumerwill be cut in their place 3700 millionworth of increased transportation user fees will be increased that means this agreement represents a net 1 8 billion tax cut for americans as someone who has fought hard to cut taxes this cut is an unexpected bonus and further reason to support this agreement the second objection is sovereignty opponents of nafta have claimed that nafta abandons congress role in regulating trade and undermines our national sovereignty i have looked into these concerns and am satisfied our environmental transportation health safety and labor laws will not be unduly weakened by this agreement as evidence of this 42 of 50 state governors support his trade agreement i am unconvinced that governors from both the right and the left of the political spectrum would support this agreement if it were going to undercut their ability to set policy for their states in conclusion the time to ratify nafta is now under the current probusiness government in mexico that countrys economy is going to grow substantially over the next decade we can either lower our trade barriers work with mexico

medicare would have to be cut 480 for each person enrolled and the government would have 35 billion less each year to fight crime to make jobcreating improvements in infrastructure to protect the environment and to fund education and other essential government services there should also be no mistake that the stenholm and barton amendments will undermine cornprehensive health care reform every serious health care reform proposal uses current medicare and medicaid expenditures to pay in part for reform but these amendments would require those programs be cut to balance the budget robbing reform of necessary financing if we pass the stenholm or barton balance budget amendment we undermine comprehensive reform of our health care system that will finally restrain health care costs we would continue our pattern of cutting medicare and medicaid in the absence of overall containment of health care costs and continue cost shifting to the private sector the stenholm and barton balanced budget amendments are a poor substitute for political leadership we demonstrated that leadership last year with passage of the budget reconciliation bill which reduced the deficit by 500 billion and strengthened our economy we must and can go further with comprehensive health care reform to control health care spending the balanced budget amendment on the other hand would destabilize our economy it would require us to raise taxes and cut spending on countercyclical programs like unemployment compensation at just the time when it would hurt our economy mostduring recessions it would creafe an irresistible temptation to raid the social security trust fund to elminate the deficit i urge its defeat"], [0.001176208257675171, 0.49882379174232483, 0, "i understand that but the fact of the matter

gentleman would yield i remember when i was first elected in 1987 there were already 30 people who supported the gentlemans plan and then it got to be about 60 and then it got to about 150 i say to the gentleman i mean youre getting closer and youre getting closer because youre trying to do whats right and you got help from republicans and i think more and more democrats are coming to the conclusion that you cant be for a balanced budget amendment but not be willing to cut spending in the process of cutting spending i have to tell you mr kasich there are parts in this budget that we put together that i do not like there are a number of parts i do not like but i cannot vote against an entire package because i do not like certain parts of it that is why we are in the mess we are in today everybody request find a reason to vote no against the package but if we do that we are going to continue to see ever expanding budget deficits so i am not frustrated in part because of the good work you have done and in part because of the good work i am seeing on the democratic side of the aisle among some very conscientious members i really believe our only solution is for us to work on a bipartisan basis i really hope that the white house will see the opportunity and seize it and theni think we will see some big differences"]]}
