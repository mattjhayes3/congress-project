this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother when he said we see wrong and try to right it we see suffering and try to heal it and we see war and try to stop it we have tried the military solution let us try something else let us give peace a chance let us not give this aid to the contras"], [0.008728206157684326,

the soldiers and families of the seventh light infantry division stationed at fort ord in my district of california there is no question that this nation should respond when there is a legitimate threat to our security but this action follows in the footprints of a haphazard policy in central amorica that is irtually in shambles it is mired in deceptions and lies and lack of diplomatic effort and almost singleminded emphasis on military responses and partisan political confrontation for these reasons it is difficult to know whether this is a legitimate security threat and response to that

massachustts there is virtually nothing the gentleman said that i would disagree with it is a very thoughtful moderate balanced statement and i would simply like to add to it i myself have been deeply concerned i could use a lot of adjectives such as horrified and shocked to describe my feelings about what appeared to be the unmeasured response of the israeli government to the violence on the west bank and the announcement by the defense minister that israel is going to use force and beatings as a matter of policy that to me was totally illconsidered there is no question that israel pays a formidable price in international good will and credibility when statements like that are made of all the governments in the world of all the peoples in the world to use excessive violence it is hard to think of a country wvhose history within recent memory four decades makes such action less appropriate and more offensive i have to say that in all honesty it has been a very painful process for all of us here who have a deep sense of commitment to israel who want to see her survive who want to see her maintain her special relationship with our country and who want to see her maintain the very special moral and ethical quality that has differentiated israel from all the governments in the middle east and most of the governments in the world it has been painful for those of us who care about those things to see what is going on and i hope very much that israel will cease the policy of public beatings breaking hands and breaking bones in response to arab violence i regret saying this publicly but congressman barney frank of massachusetts did bring up this subject and he treated it in a very thoughtful way so perhaps it is appropriate to comment on it i expressed these views privately in an hourlong meeting with the israeli ambassador to the united states about a month ago so here i am going public but let me just add a footnote that first of all these are very trying experiences under similarly trying experiences with comparatively untrained or insufficiently trained troops we had our kent state we had our my lai and we consider ours a moral and an ethical country but sometimes the training of troops and the training of national guard personnel is not sufficient for the extraordinary conditions under which they all of a sudden have to function and i suspect there was some degree of lack of training and lack of preparedness for these violent episodes on the part of the israeli troops they are trained soldiers and they are trained for combat they are not trained for civil disobedience and civil rebellion and it must be quite clearly recognized that these young kids these palestinian kids were not playing kids games they were not playing spih the bottle they were not playing mumbletypeg they were playing lethal games when you throw a molotov cocktail people get killed when you throw large hunks of rock and cement people get killed a young arab youth was killed by a hunk of cement that was thrown by a palistinian and we have seen pictures of both soldiers and television cameramen writhing on the ground in agony after having been hit by large rocks these are very serious lethal games that the palestinian youth are playing apparently these lethal games are not entirely spontaneous some kind of master hand is organizing them and guiding them and i think the israeli government has an absolute right in its own self defense to meet that kind of lethal violence with sufficient force to quell it and to control it it is very difficult to measure what kind of force is sufficie force as we have found out in our country let me also say that the israeli government for 40 years repeatedly has expressed the position that it is willing to sit down with the arabs and talk about all the issues the only arab chief of tate who took them up on that was president sadat and we all know regrettably the tragic history that ensured fi 9m his pattern of cooperation and hi openhandedness in dealing with the state of israel assassination has become an accepted means of political expression in the arab world and no doubt one of the reasons which gives king hussein pause at accepting a public posture of cooperating with the is aelis is the memory that he has frorm childhood of the vision of his grandflther being shot down in cold blood by arab extremists when there was suspicion that his grandfather was cooperating with the jewish agency of palestine of course this long precedes the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 and perhaps it was true that he was cooperating with the jewish agency for palestine in trying to bring some kind of common understanding some kind of consensus some kind of compromise and some kind of conciliation to the very troubled period in those days predating the founding of the state of israel tlpat policy of assassination for willingness to meet with the israelis halfway or even a quarter of the way has persisted there have been a whole string of political assassinations directed against the socalled arab moderate such as the massacre of syrian citizens in the village of horns by syrian troops those assassinations have no doubt had a very stultifying impact on tlhe willingness of arab chiefs of state or arab civilians andcivic leaders to express some willingness to meet israel at the conference table israel today has a clearly expressed position of being ready to sit down and negotiate with the arabs on every aspect of peace whether israel should agree to a process of trading land for peace is a decision that only the israelis are capable of making how much land for how much peace i could not define the land areas on the west bank or in gaza that israel could reasonably give up without having to face far higher security risks these are very sophisticated military and security decisions that i do not feel qualified to make i am not sure that many of the 535 members of the house and senate are qualified to make that decision either how much peace what does peace mean peace certainly means more than nonbelligerency israel gave up a very considerable portion of land in the sinai desert to establish peace with egypt yet they did not get peace what they got was a minimal level of nonbelligerency peace means far more than that peace means commerce peace means the exchange of students peace means the exchange of scientists peace means the exchange of business people peace means joint programs for development of all kinds peace meaiis joint telecommunications projects involving radio and telephone and television peace means joint projects affecting the environment such as the mutual joint exploitation of the scarce water resources in the middle east and peace means the exchanr e of cultural representatives even with egypt the one country in the middle east that has gone further than a status of total belligerency even with that country israel signed a peace treaty but did not get peace at the most they have gotten a begrudging arrangement for nonbelligerency that is a lot the absence of war is a heck of a lot better than a continuation of war but still israel paid a great price for peace and did not ever get what we normally think of as the full measure of peace and the blessings of peace they got a small measure of nonbelligerency nothing more so israel had to do some agonizing introspection on how much land will not jeopardize their security for how much peace how much can israel trust a signature an arab signature on a peace treaty i do not know the answer to that i suspect the israelis are far more sophisticated and far better equipped to make that decision of haw much land they are willing to sacrifice for a collection of arab signatires on a peace treaty i suspect that the israelis are far letter qualified to make the decision a to whether if the arabs ever had a viable military option they would not instantaneously take advantage of it no matter how many signatures were on how many peace treaties i cannot answer that question all of these issues have to be factored into the question of how much land for how much peace these are agonizing questions for all of us and i would state that our predilection for pushing israel against her better judgment into a posture of agreeing to make some sacrifices of land for some kind of peace is basically dubious proposition i know that president reagan and secretary shultz would desperately and urgently like to see some kind of resolution or at least the beginnings of some kind of resolution to these agonizingly complicated and emotion ridden anxiety ridden problems of the middle east it is only natural they would they would take legitimate pride in that accomplishment i give president reagan total credit for having been a friend of peace in the middle east and having been a stout and loyal friend of the state of israel i give secretary shultz credit beyond my ability to express in words he has been an extraordinarily talented thoughtful wise human being in his policies toward the middle east and i must say that when he was appointed secretary of state coming to that job from the vantage point of having been ceo or chief executive officer of the bechtel corp doing billions of dollars of business in the middle east i and some of my colleagues had some pretty profound reservations about him but they were quickly dispelled when we had a chance to hear him out discuss the issues with him and watch his performance he is an extraordinary man no matter what administration succeeds the reagan administration i suspect that secretary shultz will be sorely missed for his great qualities of heart his great qualities of intellect and his great qualities of integrity and decency that shine forth in every arena he is a remarkable human being but i suggest that we have to think about a whole long succession of presidents at least since world war ii almost every one of whom had the same conviction that they wanted to settle this agonizingly difficult problem of the middle east on their turf they have come up with one quick fix after another in the 40 years since world war ii the israelis have a long memory and they have to place all these individual efforts by individual presidents and secretaries of state to find a solution to the problem on their watch they have to view all of these successive efforts with a long and deep sense of history and perhaps they look around the world and see that some problems just cannot be solved by a quick neat solution we have problems with the soviet union that apparently although hopefully they are being reduced in order of magnitude now for 40 years since world war ii have been virtually intractable after all of the negotiations that have taken place over the 7 years of the reagan administration we and the soviets are each still spending 300 billionodd a year on defense hopefully we will gradually reduce that amount but we have not solved the basic problems between ourselves and the soviet union the british who are about as civilized a people as has ever populated this earth have still got agonizingly difficult problems with the irish the irish have agonhlingly difficult problems between irish catholics and irish protestants when you go to ireland and you visit with the protestant leadership in belfast and then you say what wonderful people they are they are intelligent they are thoughtful they are witty and they have got a rich history surely they can be expected to negotiate away these problems then you go to dublin and you meet with the irish catholic leadership and you say what marvelous thoughtful intelligent people these are why cant they get together well they have not gotten together these problems go back 400 years apparently they are virtually intractable there arc other places around the world the problems that the belgians have with nonbelgianspeaking groups and the problems the frenchcanadiansthe quebecquoise the levesque supportershave with the englishspeaking government in canada seem to be comparatively intractable as well so there are problems around the world which do not seem to be susceptible to a quick fix of easy rapid solutions it is just possible that the israelis thinkand i do not know this for a factthat there are not any quick fixes to the problems between arabs and israelis and that in all likelihood once they get into the business of territoryforpeace they are going to be under great pressure to make sacrifices of territory that are not in their best interests there are some israelis who have profound misgivings about the nature and quality of the land they gave back to egypt when they made a peace with egypt i think they expected a larger richer definition of peace than what they got so there may be some reservations about moving down that slippery slope of peaceforterritory or territoryforpeace i would respect their right to make those decisions and i would respect their right to tell us look we understand your tremendous eagerness your noteworthy praiseworthy eagerness to bring some kind of solace peace and reconciliation to the middle east but after the peace conference is over you all go back home and we are the ones who are left to live with these understandings we are the ones who have to evaluate over the years how much territorial sacrifice in terms of real security we made for how much of a peace what value do we place on that peace how much can we rely on that peace how much can we rely on the integrity of the arab signatures on that peace treaty there is no one who can make those decisions there is no one who can examine that calculus of factors other than the israelis themselves so i want to say how much i respect congressman frank for the very thoughtful way in which he treated this issue i want to say how much i respect the 30odd members of the senate for their bona fides and their real desire to contribute to world peace by the letter that they recently wrote to prime minister shamir but i think on the bottom line once we have made some suggestions and once as friends we have given whatever advice we choose to give the israelis on the way they have controlled the riotsand remember from their point of view it has to be considered gratuitous adviceonce we have given them our best judgment on adopting this policy or that policy or refusing to adopt this posture or that posture and explain that their decision may have a price tag and may cost them in good will military and economic aid and may cost them in credibility around the world then i think in all fairness we ought to let the israeli knesset the israeli military and security branches of their government make the hard decisions on into the actual process of reconciliation negotiation and compromise they have had the offer on the table ever since 1948 to talk what kind of preconditions we should impose upon them as to how and under what circumstances the talks get started is a very serious question i suggest that we should be very reluctant to force israel into any format into any system of negotiations that they feel may threaten their security they are a sovereign state we are a great friend of theirs we can give them advice and counsel and express the costs and the benefits to them of various alternative policies but when it comes to biting the bullet and making these critically important decisions involving the security of the region the peace for the region and the security of the state of israel i think we are going to have to let them think and decide for themselves i thank the speaker and yield back the balance of my time"],

financial industry frankly i am in sympathy with many aspects of the senatepassed bill but it would be improper and irresponsible to ask my colleagues to accept these provisions on which there have been no hearings no debate and no votes in the subcommittees and committee of jurisdiction in the house of representatives there are at least three key reasons why i think it would be a mistake to attempt to bring the s 790 issues to the floor of the house in the form of a conference report at the present time first the issues are too important to be acted on without hearings debate and votes within the committee and on the house floor the house should have an opportunity to work its wifl on each of these issues second the parliamentary procedure we would face with such a conference is so convoluted and involved to render the objective a virtual impossibility third the issues involved in the senate bill are so controversial that such a conference would almost certainly doom chances for early action on fslic something that has become very close to an emergency situation that has little room left for more delays let me just outline some of the parliamentary problems facing us if we tried to deal with the s 790 package assuming passage of h r 27 this approach would then require the chairman to ask unanimous consent to have the text of h r 27 substituted for the text of s 790 and request a conference there is no doubt in my mind that there would be an objection to this unanimous consent request assuming and i think it is a fair assumption the unanimous consent would be objected to one would then go back into committee and have the committee direct its chairman to go back to the floor and move to go to conference with the senate on their legislation i do not believe the committee nor the house would act favorably on such a request but lets assume the unanimous consent request is approved we then would go to conference with the senate banking committee the house containing a onetitle bill and the senate containing 10 titles 9 of which bear no relationship to the house bill as far as the house germaneness rule is concemed in conference the house conferees hands would be severely tied we could not seek to amend their 10 titlies to more adequately perhaps reflect the house views because we would run into very serious scope problems which would completely kill the conferencereported bill in the house and in fact force us back to conference on just the fslic titles in both bills the house conferees would be forced therefore to essentially adopt all of

the senate to our bill are for the most part laudable i would like particularly to concentrate attention for just a moment on the provisions with respect to diplomatic immunity what is it that the people in the other body have asked us to add to this bill the heart of it the heart of the helms amendment is a provision that says whenever there is probable cause to believe that an individual who is entitled to immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the united states may have committed a serious criminal offense particularly a crime of violence the secretary of state shall request the foreign ministry of the country such individual represents to waive the immunity of that individual if such waiver is denied the secretary of state shall declare that individual non grata or insure the removal from the united states we are not talking here about just willynilly kicking out foreign dilomats because some representatives oi the opposition in their country points the finger at some diplomat in this country and asks us to remove him we are talking about probable cause we are talking about serious offenses there are many cases that we all know about where individuals in this country have been harmed by the actions of diplomats from other countries who are immune from our justice system and it seems to me that in that regard at least on this particular provision the senator from north carolina adds something that probably most members of this house would agree with i know that the state department is recommending a veto i am always anmzed by the things that prompt the state departments concerns but i would say that what is contained in this provision in regard to immunity is something that ought to be enacted by the congress i would be personally quite

destruction of over 7 500 jewish businesses the utter obliteration of 275 synagogues and the deportation of 30 000 jewish men to the concentration camps of dachau buchenwald and sachsenhausen the knowledge that the liquidation of the jewish people in europe had begun was acknowledged by the new york times on november 13 1938 when it stated germany issued a new series of decrees yesterday to complete the liquidation of the jews history has shown us that no one in the international community responded to this statement which indeed was a horrifying prophecy as a result of global silence hitler escalated his persecution of jews wherever he could and authorized the creation of the infamous final solution by 1945 when the war was over the truth was there for all the world to see over 6 million jewish men women and children gone from this earth exterminated by the cruelest means ever devised and the one date that burns in the collective jewish memory is kristallnacht november 9 1938

and local school districts in enhancing the quality of our nations elementary and secondary schools it does so by offering a package of prograins that collectively reaffirm the federal commitment to access to quality education for disadvantaged students and other students with special needs i come to you today as a former educator and local school board member i am acutely aware that we must encourage and reward excellence in education and provide assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates h r 5 accomplishes that goal however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education should be a limited one beyond my philosophical opposition to sending tax dollars to washington only to see 60 cents returned it is undeniable that state and local governments are best equipped to know what their particular community needs most local governments can provide the kind of flexibility creativity and attention to detail that is impossible on the federal level the final version of h r 5 includes my amendments on youth suicide prevention the roukema amendments establishes authorized youth suicide prevention programs as allowable prograins under the antidrug abuse act and chapter ii block grant fund the chapter ii block grant which provides money for such programs as early childhood development at risk students schoolwide improvements now includes one more important program suicide prevention let me be clear this does not mandate suicide prevention education this allows suicide prevention programs as an option my amendment allows local schools if they desire to apply chapter ii block grant money to establish needed prograins in youth suicide prevention my own district in northern new jersey was the scene of a terrible tragedy last year we all remember so vividly that four young people took their own lives dramatic evidence of the rising incidence of suicide across the country in the aftermath the community sought funds to develop a program to counsel children teachers and parents however their only recourse was the lengthy difficult process of applying for a federal grant which in the end was denied now i do not want a national competitive grant program to be the only recourse for communities to receive money if they desire my amendment is constructed to give the authority solely to the local entity without imposing the federal qovermients will oi discretion on local agercies it is an eflort to supplement and help schools deal with a tragic problem within their communities if they choose that option the school is the one institution that is the common denominator for all these students the purpose of my amendment is to use the schools to identify highrisk students and to identify them before they drop out in addition our local option provides the opportunity for the community to decide if there is a genuine need principals school teachers and officials who are most sensitive to the specific local circumstances will have the opportunity to establish programs and train personnel there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this bill its scope reaches all ages from early

they receive in meeting their medical costs provided by medicare and medicaid the programs of the older americans act help to improve their quality of life it is timely because more and more americans are readhing the age of 65 including myself and they require support through programs that enhance their quality of life we are facing an aging here ln our american sodiety which is unprecedented in our history and unprecedented in the needs which must be met by the time we reach the next century the year 2000 just under 13 years rom now 1 in 7 americans will be over the age of 65 as compared with 1 in 25 at the start of the 20th century not only will their numbers be greater as we finish out this century but their needs are going to be greater in terms of their quality of life mr chairman 22 years ago i voted for the original kolder americans act together with 393 of my colleagues only 1 member voted against that bill as i said last year my committee provided n excess of 1 billion for the programs authorized tunder the older americans act i believe that all of that money was wellspent and i hope that we can isustain that level of commitmentin fiscalyear 1988 i would like to commend the members of the authorizing committee particularly the chairman the gentleman from michigan and the ranking republican a very able member of the subcomrittee thegentleman from iowa mr tauxel for

the veto there was no opportunity to override the veto h r 1 would authorize over 18 billion of federal funds for fiscal years 1986 through 1994 these funds would assist unitedstates cities across the nation in the construction of wastewater treatment plants included in the bill is a new state revolving loan program that would provide a transition from federal to state funding for the construction of wastewater treatment plants this would allow the federal government to eventually turn over the responsibility of funding for the treatment plants to state and local governments the bill would also establish a new program for the control of nonpoint source pollution this kind of pollution is the result of runoff from streets parking lots and farmlands these kinds of pollution account for almost half of the water pollution in some areas h r 1 would authorize 400 million for 4 years which would allow states to develop and create programs to monitor and control nonpoint source pollution other major provisions of the bill include the establishment of a program that would identify toxic hot spots these are waters that do not meet water quality standards because of toxic pollutants this also increases civil and criminal penalties for violations of the clean water act and provides the epa to assess administrative civil penalties also the bill establishes a program to monitor and control the pollution in the great lakes directs the epa to develop plans for the protection of estuaries and extends the program to study and restore the water quality of lakes across the country i support

matter i think many of the concerns you reflect will be discussed here this morning it seems to me as a result it is clear that the administration was caught in between a situation where people were held in unsuitable conditionsafter all presumably the helsinki accords refer not to just other countries but presumably to us as well on the other hand many of the people who were detained it seems fairly clear were not in a position to take their place in the community in the united states so some middle ground had to be found and some hope had to be given it seems to me to the detainees through treatment and education and training and so forth many of them could eventually become released into the community if they were not otherwise deportable that is something that had to be reconciled it seems to me that the agreement however reached last november was the unlocking of the situation and the administration is now moving forwardand were going to see in what fashion i dont think anyone contemplated tile catharsis of that resulting in the riots but at least out of that i think can come a realization of some of the ends that you have suggested in your testimony and

0.5198061466217041, 0, "during the last several weeks there has been quite a bit of discussion about the socalled sleaze factor in politics in particular there has been discussions about the sleaze factor in the reagan administration during the democratic convention last month a number of the speakers at that convention alluded to the overwhelming sleaze factor in the reagan administration and the need to clean up the corruption in government that had occurred over the last several years the presidential nominee of the democratic party n fact referred to that at the democratic convention and has referred to it since as one of the things he is going to do in fact the democrats have come forth with a fairly comprehensive list of what they regard as the sleaze factor i have been able to obtain a copy of that list i have it here this evening it is a list that is compiled by the house subcommittee on civil service it says here representative patricia schroeder and it gives a phone number it lists 242 people who allegedly have been a part of the sleaze factor of the reagan administration let me read from the front of this document to tell the house what it is this document purports to do it says this the following is an index updated to march 30 1988 of newspaper articles concerning individuals appointed by or serving in the reagan administration who have been the subject of charges of unethical conduct the allegations have not been further investigated by the subcommittee so what they have done is they have compiled all the sleaze they can find out there and they have come up with 242 individuals who are involved and they rightfully make the point that 242 individuals in an administration is far too many people involved in sleaze i do not quarrel with that i do quarrel however with this report and i do suggest that the sleaze factor in the reagan administration if in fact this is true is compounded in this congress let me tell the members why i recently did a little research what i found was that president reagan has appointed in that 7year period since taking office in 1981 18 270 individuals to executive branch positions if in fact the democrats are correct that 242 of those individuals are charged with some kind of misconduct that means that 1 3 percent of the people appointed by this administration have in fact been engaged in some kind of misbehavior now let me say to the members that that is a very conservative estimate because i did not include in that estimate any of the people appointed to judicial offices despite the fact that this report to which i am referring discusses people who were appointed as judges but i did not include that because that would be another few thousand people and that would make the percentage even lower but i am going to use the most conservative figure and i am going to say that 1 3 percent of all the people in the reagan administration have been accused of sleaze as a result of this report let us examine the report is that figure in fact a true figure is this 242 figure that has been used over and over and over again to define sleaze in the administration a real figure let us remember what i said that the report says it does it says that it is an index concerning individuals appointed by or serving in the reagan administration that is interesting because as i leaf through this report guess who i find in the report i find mrs caspar w weinberger mrs weinberger was never appointed to anything by this administration she is the wife of the former secretary of defense how in the world did she get on the list if the list is what it purports to be she is not a member of the administration and never has been then i leaf further back here in the report and who do i find well i found mrs donald regan again the wife of a cabinet officer i found in the report mrs drew lewis the wife of a former cabinet officer they took family and included them as members of the administration as my colleagues know i went through the list and do they know who i found on their list nancy reagan the presidents wife now what is she accused of what is the sleazy thing she did well it turns out she took fancy clothes as gifts from american designers well she has admitted to that i mean that was open and so on it was part of the inaugural activities and things like that and so on but to suggest as one of 242 people that are the sleaze factor of the reagan administration nancy reagan is on this list makes this list almost ludicrous but it gets worse michael reagan the presidents son who has never been appointed to anything by this administration is on this list he is one of the 242 but it goes even further and perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that they took family members and put them on the isit i found on this list the name of james m beggs and for my colleagues who do not remember mr beggs he was the distinguished administrator of nasa of the space agency mr beggs was literally railroaded out of his job it is one of the more horrid incidents of the kind of railroading of a government official that can ever be found mr beggs has been apologized to by the attorney general of the united states distinguished americans such as the columnist jack anderson have pointed out that mr beggs did absolutely nothing wrong the court to which he was taken found him completely innocent on this list the man is regarded as guilty of sleaze despite being proven in the courts as being innocent in other words if one takes the democratic sleaze factor for what it is on this list we have not only abandoned the idea that one is innocent until proven guilty under the democrat formulation on this list one is guilty even though proven innocent what a horrid kind of thing and my colleagues may say well its probably just one mistake one itsybitsy little mistake walker dont make a big deal out of one little mistake like that then i leafed back here in the report and who do i find on the report ray donovan former secretary of labor same thing he went to court on these charges he was found innocent in the court and yet he still shows up on the democrats list as being someone who is a sleaze factor despite the fact that they say in this report that mr donovan was acquitted so one is still sleazy one is still a slime ball even though one has been acquitted what kind of system is this this is absolutely absurd to have a list like this but it gets better"]]}
