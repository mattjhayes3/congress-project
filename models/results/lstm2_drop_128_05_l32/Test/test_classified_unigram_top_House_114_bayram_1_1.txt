anything like it but he cautioned us as business leaders that day he cautioned us he said look when the government doesnt understand something the first thing it will want to do is regulate it the next thing it will want to do is tax it and you have then effectively killed it it wasnt an accident that i used in the opening statement the language that under the proposed rules from the fcc the

thank the gentleman for yielding it is easy and comfortable to think that sex trafficking only happens in countries outside the united states the truth is that more than 100 000 are at risk of being trafficked for commercial sex here in the united states each and every year here in america we have a word for a situation when one group of people is dehumanized and has their basic human rights snuffed out for someone elses economic gain that word is slavery the problem we have today is not a thing of the past it is not from some remote corner of the world that you cant find on a map slavery in the form of human trafficking is happening right now it is happening in our cities suburbs and rural communities it is happening in each and every one of our congressional districts i am sad to say that minneapolis minnesota my home state has actually been listed as one of the 13th largest centers for sexual exploitation of children in the entire country i realize how critical it is to educate our community about what i have learned from talking to victims like dayanna who became a 13yearold trafficking victim dayanna didnt get a lot of love and attention from her mother or family while she took it upon herself to take care of her brothers and sisters she longed for someone to give her love and attention she ended up being seduced by a man who promised to be her boyfriend guess what at age 13 within days after running away with him she found herself being trafficked in chicago and philadelphia without a home and separated from her family only a daring jump from a secondstory window actually allowed her to escape many might think that if dayanna had come from a different family situation she wouldnt have been trafficked sadly that is not the case i will never forget meeting with the mother of a young woman named brittany brittany was a very young girl who was violently raped murdered and then found dead in an impound lot last february unlike dayanna brittany had a loving family she worked with children at a local recreation center and taught dance lessons despite these circumstances brittany was also a victim of sex trafficking but was too embarrassed to speak out until it was too late as brittanys mother told me it doesnt matter if victims have a home because if sex trafficking can happen to my daughter it can happen to any young girl that is exactly what we are talking about young girls who are only 12 13 or 14 years old they are not old enough to have graduated from high school they are not old enough to have voted in an election they are not old enough to pass their drivers license exam in fact in most states these girls would be considered criminals that should be incarcerated and charged with prostitution instead of being treated as victims we found that criminalization only traumatizes these girls and actually isolates them from the community and the services that they need and deserve that is why we need this legislation h r 159 the stop exploitation through trafficking act which focuses on incentivizing states to have safe harbor laws safe harbor laws ensure that these girls are treated as victims safe harbor laws will give legal protection for minor victims and provide them with specialized social services we know that by bringing these victims out of the shadows we can make sure they get the services they need including medical and psychological treatment housing legal services educational assistance job training and more law enforcement can then focus on actually bringing the perpetrators of these awful crimes to justice this bipartisan legislation incentivizes states to adopt these safe harbor laws so we can expand on the successes we have seen in states like minnesota in 2011 minnesota became the fifth state to approve safe harbor legislation after their safe harbor laws went into effect guess what law enforcement in minnesota began arresting more johns than ever before and human trafficking convictions more than doubled best practices evaluated by law enforcement and victims groups show that removing the fear of prosecution from victims actually works today only a little over a dozen states have full safe harbor laws we have got to do more to protect these victims and be sure the pimps and johns are brought to justice this legislation also helps victims by codifying a national human trafficking hotline and making victims eligible for job corps services by giving them an avenue to access for job skill training they can begin to rebuild their lives the bill also helps law enforcement by allowing the unitedstates marshals service to support other state local or federal law enforcement agencies that are investigating missing child cases finally the bill increases oversight by requiring additional reporting to congress on restitution orders in trafficking cases these provisions are all essentially critically important pieces in the effort to combat sex trafficking i want to thank my colleague gwen moore from wisconsin for her advocacy passion and partnership on this legislation and moving it forward on a bipartisan basis i also want to thank the leaders of the judiciary committee team who have recognized that this is a top priority and moved it quickly early in this session of congress i look forward to working with my colleague senator

in the house foreign affairs committee which considered the bill on february 24 and voted it out by voice unanimously with no opposition it is also my understanding that the bill also passed unanimously in the committee on homeland security as the chairman of our committee explained this legislation authorizes the state department and the department of homeland security to develop opensource versions of software that vets travelers against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases once the software is developed we will be able to share it with our allies and multilateral organizations involved in police work such as interpol that means that we will have better software in the hands of worldwide law enforcement sooner and it will be interoperable as things stand now we do not have a comprehensive global database for identifying and tracking terrorists as the bipartisan task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel which was established by chairman mccaul and the committee on homeland security highlighted in its september 2015 report countries including the united states rely on a patchwork system for swapping extremist identities increasing the odds foreign fighters will slip through the cracks the paris and brussels terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a global system since those tragedies there has been finger pointing about missed intelligence and criticism over the lack of information sharing across borders just in february europol warned that more than 5 000 europeans with european passports had traveled to isis and syria to become isis fighters in late march european security officials told the associated press that the islamic state group had trained at least 400 attackers and sent them to europe to carry out specific attacks of course we have a visa waiver relationship with most of europe and that means these european passport holders will be able to visit the united states without special vetting by our officials there is an exception to that for those european passports that have been stamped indicating they visited syria or iraq this should not give us a whole lot of false security because typically foreign fighters who want to join isis travel to turkey where their passport is stamped with a turkish stamp and then they sneak into isiscontrolled areas isis does not stamp their passport entry into the islamic state so the passports of these europeans that have gone to fight for isis in iraq and syria do not bear a syrian or iraqi stamp in addition if for some reason they did bear such a stamp any european can simply go and ask for a replacement passport and in most cases there will be no record available to the united states that this person had ever visited syria or iraq so we need a system that gives us the best possible opportunity to identify foreign fighters but especially those who hold european passports if we are going to fight and prevent global terrorism in

of the bill the gentleman from arizona voted against the bill and signed dissenting views with six other democrats so this point that the previous reauthorization acts were noncontroversial and nonpartisan is not true i think whoever wrote that for the gentleman ought to again do a little correct history as one who sponsored this bill way back in 1975 and it became law in 1976 it is probably the most successful legislation that ever passed this house to create a sustainable yield of fisheries for the united states of america and to have someone try to hijack this legislation by interest groups when all those involvedthe fishermen the recreational the commercial the restaurants the conservationists that know fisheries the state of alaska and all other statessupport the magnuson act and the improvements we have made in this billyes we have some flexibility the bill would amend the magnusonstevens fisheries conservation act the premier law as i mentioned before it allows for regional management of fisheries the law gives guidance through its national standards and creates the process that allows the councils to develop fishery management plans the councils provide a regional or constituentbased approach remember this is not about the government this bill was written by this congress for the people not noaa not nmsa not the state department not the sierra club and not the pew group it was written for fishermen for sustainable yields of fish for the communities it provides a regional concept it is critical to the protection of coastal economies and for allowing the stakeholders to be part of the management of the fisheries to address the everchanging needs of fisheries and fishing communitiesand i have been through this thing four times from the original to todaythe congress has passed various amendments to this act changes were based on knowledge of the times gained through experience improvements in science and better management techniques in the mid1990s congress addressed overfishing included protections for habitat improvements for fisheries science and reductions in bycatch these were the issues of the time and they were addressed as needed a factor of that time also included the lack of resources to fund stock assessments to provide needed data to the regional fishery management councils something that continues to be an issue today a lot of decisions are made without science the act was last amended in 2007 congress included measures to set sciencebased annual catch limits to prevent overfishing including a requirement to end overfishing within 2 years accountability measures were adopted which meant harvest reductions if harvest levels were exceeded according to the national marine fisheries service we have now reached the point where overfishing has effectively ended in this country h r 1335 started being developed 4 years ago the committee held over a dozen hearings with testimony from over 100 witnesses as with past reauthorizations and in line with a main purpose of the actto balance conservation with economic use of the resourceh r 1335 follows a middle road while many today may complain the bills flexibility rolls back scientific protections that is just not accurate the flexibility in the bill is based on science rebuilding of fish stocks will be based on the biology of fish stock harvest levels will still be based on science and at levels where overfishing will not occur the regional councils will continue to follow recommendations of their science and statistical committee during every reauthorization cycle the magnusonstevens act is updated to be closely in sync with currentday science management techniques and knowledge as the fishermen communities the councils and fishery managers develop better techniques and learn lessons from implementing the law congress can take that knowledge to improve that law flexibility is cornerstone of the law the magnusonstevens act
