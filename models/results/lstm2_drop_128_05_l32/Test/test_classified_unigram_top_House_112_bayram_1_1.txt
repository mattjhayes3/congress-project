medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there

percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans

while the president is the commander in chief the congressional duties fall under article 1 section 8 and the commander in chief can relate his or her duties to article 2 section 2 it is generally

whether he or she is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or congressional authorization and so here we are today indicating that it

acts in libya compounding the problem is a continued violence an assault on the people of libya so for a moment let me focus on general qadhafi to ask him the question is he reasoned and does he

crosscountry operations to capture and assassinate dissidents were organized by argentina in cooperation with southern cone military regimes in what is known as operation condor over the years as the victims of the repression increasingly went missing a new tactic of the argentine security forces was revealed it is estimated that 30 000 people disappeared in argentina between 1976 and 1985 many of these victims known as the disappeared were abducted they were tortured and then dropped far out into the ocean during the dictatorship hundreds of children were born into captivity and distributed to members of the argentine security forces while their mothers are believed to have been killed the identity of some of these children has been discovered but the majority of their identities and

governor william donald schaefer he died just a few weeks ago after a long time of public service william donald schaefer was one of the great american mayors few mayors can ever say that they transformed a city as thoroughly as did william donald schaefer transform baltimore but over his 16year tenure as mayor of baltimore he led a dramatic and historic turnaround in 1971 when his mayoralty started baltimore was a struggling city a city plagued by population flight crime and decaying urban infrastructure when so many had given up on baltimore mayor schaefer made it his mission to stand up to that decay and we can still see his legacy today it is a legacy that includes physical landmarks like camden yards the national aquarium baltimores harbor place and an outstanding light rail system projects that he saw through to completion as both mayor and governor of our state just as importantly mayor schaefers legacy came in thousands of gestures that showed just how deeply he cared about the people he represented and how seriously he took his work personally addressing illegal dumping in alleys or broken equipment at parks driving through the city at night on the lookout for everything from potholes to crime trouble spots and even jumping into the aquariums seal pool complete with a rubber ducky when the city failed to complete the aquarium on time my colleague from oregon is shaking his head because we all know that famous picture above all his colorful passionate and dedicated leadership added up to the change not just in baltimores appearance and infrastructure but in the mindset of the words of the baltimore sun when they said he changed the way the city felt about itself how important leaders are to make that happen in the minds of their people we have an agenda by the way that is make it in america that is trying to change that psychology as well that were going to make it were going to succeed were going to expand william donald

point in maryland politics many would have ridden off into the sunset but not william donald schaefer he couldnt get enough of the work he loved and he ran for state comptroller and won twice in his last job he was one of our states most respected voices for fiscal responsibility before he died governor schaefer was asked how hed like to be remembered and he answered there are two words he cared people he said mock me and make fun of it but its the truth and as someone who worked closely with william donald schaefer throughout his years as mayor and governor and comptroller i can say without any hesitation or fear of contradiction william donald schaefer cared he was a man of the people he listened he acted it is the truth and it mattered because at the time when so many wrote off our cities caring took remarkable courage and strength a great architect was once laid to rest in a building he himself had designed his tombstone read and i quote if you seek his monument look around you

careful analysis of how to help individuals and their families grapple with the final chapter of life it may be the hardest issue in health care and the fear that it invokes can be a powerful weapon for most of us the majority of health care we receive in our lifetime will be administered in those last few months its when we need the most doctors and nursing care medical procedures and oftentimes in hospitals but we know from scientific studies that when patients are educated about their treatment options they make decisions that are not only aligned with their personal preferences but shared decisionmaking relieves stress and anxiety ironically sometimes getting less intensive help like in a hospice not only improves the quality of life these patients many of them actually live longer from a public policy perspective its perverse that medicare will pay for almost any medical procedure yet not reimburse doctors to have a thoughtful conversation to prepare patients and their families for the delicate complex and emotionally demanding decisions surrounding the end of life thats why i sought to direct medicare in the affordable care act to cover a voluntary discussion with the doctor about living wills power of attorney and endoflife preferences helping patients and their families clarify what they want and need should be an element of any rational comprehensive health care

supported a similar provision for terminally ill elderly patients that was part of the 2003 prescription drug bill i had a friend of mine a republican cardiovascular surgeon here in the house who told me he had many endoflife conversations but unfortunately they were often too late he wished he could have spoken to patients and their families when they could have properly reflected not just when the surgery was merely hours away during the early debates on the affordable care act i was confident that this was an area where we were making a contribution to improve the quality of health care

our current financial crisis now the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic was given the task to investigate the causes of the meltdown of our financial institutions though the commission was unsuccessful in reaching a certain consensus of the exact cause they did however conclude that the financial crisis was avoidable and was the result of the following factors an explosion in risky subprime lending an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets just among a few of the red flags surely with all those factors chairman bernanke should have been more concerned in fact the title of my speech this morning is even with warning signs bernanke failed to sound the alarm in fact he was warned by members of the federal reserve board often the release of transcripts from the federal open market committee fomc meetings in 2006 shed light on the critical failures of the federal reserve and mr bernanke to act when the warning signs were clear and present the first meeting however was spent praising bernankes predecessor outgoing federal chairman alan greenspan but the fcic later concluded that 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions that was championed by mr greenspan were the factors in devastating the stability of our nations market stripping away safeguards that simply could have avoided this catastrophe now in a later meeting on may 10 2006 of the fomc then fed governor susan bies was one of the earliest to raise concern over the nations mortgage sector which offered exotic loans that increased household debt over time instead of decreasing it now specifically her concerns stem from the absence of home equity growth and the consumers ability to absorb the uncertainties of the housing market listen to mr bernankes response when she made her declaration so far we are seeing at worst an orderly decline in the housing market but there is still i think a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly yet again another colleague then fed vice chairwoman janet yellen warns of the possibility of an unwelcome housing slump but in the meeting of august 8 2006 chairman bernanke remains hopeful in his prediction for a soft landing for our economy need i say the 2008 great recession was not a soft landing in the september meeting the feds still remained oblivious to the detrimental effects in the housing market that will affect the rest of the economy in the last meeting of the fomc fed governor bies again in december 2006 stated once again her concern of the housing market stating that mortgages securitized in the past few years warrants additional risk than the investors have been focusing on despite the concerns that reported increased difficulty getting mortgages in their region as well as a noticeable cool down in housing activity mr bernanke fails to see the warning signs and again predicts a soft landing on december 12 2006 once again this was his second statement of a soft landing in the same year it was the failure of mr bernanke to not pursue possible vulnerabilities and assuring us to the contrary that attributed to the economic crisis that we faced on february 15 2007 he stated overall economic prospects for households remains good the labor market is expected to stay healthy and real incomes should continue to rise the business sector remains in excellent financial condition again on march 28 2007 he stated the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained even on may 17 2007 despite concerns raised by fed governor bies again he said we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system how wrong he was but all of the dire warning signs were there at bernankes confirmation hearing in the senate banking committee he conceded to the notion that the central bank should have done more thats an understatement the fed had the authority and necessary power to prevent further abuses happening in the financial industry but simply chose to
