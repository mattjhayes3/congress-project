alice in wonderland trying to appreciate the rule governing debate today much less following the seven substitutes and 67 odd amendments is like playing croquet with hedgehogs and flamingos mir chairman i hold the president and his advisers primarily to blame for this ludicrous situation only a white house more interested in scenarios than fiscal responsiblity could first present congress with a stillborn budget proposal and then launch a media blitz complaining that congress was damaging chances for economic recovery by constantly delaying the budget process this administration keeps faulting congress for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this administration has failed to make any hard choices in its travesty of a budget and now complains because congress struggles in building a consensus on budget priorities i have only been here 6 years but in those years and well before never has a president sent up a budget knowing it was doomed and then gone riding off into the sunsetleavins congress to struggle without a scintilla of presidential leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are through i i have looked at all the substitutes and find their deficits with one exception because it has no deficit absolutely unacceptableand i believe the banking community wall street the american taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman from california but he balances his budget for 1983 on the backs of the elderly the poor the sick students farmers the housing automoble and steel indus tries and their workersand leaves essentially intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the american voter will return to office any member of the house of representatives or senator of whatever party who with a straight face presents a budget deficit for 1983 ranging from 96 8 billion to 109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of destruction espoused by this presidents wealthy cronies i have voted against all substitutes put before the house i shall continue to vote against others yet to be discussed the american people deserve better than the alternatives presented here for our deliberations and decision these budgets are unacceptable these things i believe"], [0.000919439597055316, 0.000919439597055316, 0, "i rise

imports with some 31 billion a year in regional exports this region has attracted some 13 billion in unitedstates direct investments and it should be noted that the caribbean region has become the main source of immigration to the united states both legal and illegal it is obvious that we do have a vital stake in this important region but unfortunately the caribbean basin has been suffering serious economic difficulties due to the escalating cost of imported energy and declining prices for their major exports such negative trends in the economic area only increase concern about the

reducing federal spending as the most effective weapon in the ongoing war against inflation has at last received its proper priority in both the white house and on capitol hill the budget resolution recently passed by the congress and with substantial impetus provided by the reagan administration acting on its mandate from the american people correctly targeted inflation as the greatest threat to this nati ns economic health and viability that message was not lost on the public works and transportation committee when the conference report to the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 directed our committee to achieve certain savings in both its authorization and direct spending programs we more than met the level of savings recommended in the reconciliation instructions in fact the committee in a strong bipartisan approach responded to the dollar targets set in the conference report by submitting recommendations containing 28 million of added savings in budgetary authority and over 400 million in outlays in accordance with budget committee guidelines the committee recommended no specific legislative changes for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 since reductions assumed by the budget resolution of the out years were for programs not presently authorized beyond fiscal year 1982 however the committee clearly and strongly expressed its commitment to achieve the recommended out year reductions when its programs come up for reauthorization in exceeding the aggregate savings directed by the budget resolution our committee complied with both the letter and the spirit of the savings directives it received while at the same time recognizing the expertise of the committee to make the necessary decisions on any programmatic changes i might say at this point that savings achieved by the public works and transportation committee in its recommendations to the budget committee were not reached without substantial discussion and some hard decisions on highly significant programs of great impact throughout the nation in making the necessary decisions on these programs our committee sought and achieved a careful balance between the essential spending reductions and the needs of vital programs in that regard the committee stressed the need to provide funding sufficient to those public works investment programs so essential to president reagans goal of national economic revitalization savings in specific programs were achieved in the following areas under public works and transportation committee jurisdiction in aviation the committee achieved a 139 million savings with 650 million cap in fiscal year 1982 budget authority for the airport development and noise abatement programs a figure substantially below the 789 million set by the congressional budget office even as we make the necessary decisions to reduce funding for aviation programs we must continue to protect our valuable capital investment in airports and air traffic control systems if we expect to meet projected increases in air traffic growth likewise the nations capital investment in its highway and public transit systems so essential to any plans for industrial revitalization must continue to receive high priorities in its recommendations to the budget committee our committee put an 8 2 million limitation for fiscal year 1982 on obligations for federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs excluding those for emergency relief and three emergency bridge projects consequently outlays for the federalaid highway program would be reduced by 500 million as compared to the budget resolution assumption of only 185 million in outlay savings in the area of highway safety the committees reconciliation proposal reduces total budget authority available for highway safety programs in fiscal year 1982 by 308 million the committee also proposed a 110 million obligation ceiling on highway safety programs in the next fiscal year budget authority for public mass transportation was reduced by the committee from that provided in the urban mass transportation act to levels anticipated by the budget resolution thus the committee achieved a 1 321 million savings in budget authority and an anticipated 200 million outlay savings in fiscal year 1982 in water pollution control programs the committee complied with the budget resolution conference reports assumption and recommended deleting the 5 billion now authorized for the environmental protection agencys construction grants program which assists municipalities in constructing publicly owned sewage treatment plants however the committee proposed a 100 million authorization to insure that states will be able to continue administering those portions of the program delegated to them for epas nonenergy research and development programs and for abatement control and compliance activities in fiscal year 1982 the committee recommended a 540 million authorization 209 million less than the amount in the congressional budget office baseline the committee recommended that funds for construction of corps of engineers water resources projects not exceed 1 588 million in fiscal year 1982 representing a reduction of 20 million more than assumed in the conference report funding for all programs authorized by the 1965 public works and economic

take up this resolution tonight but why did we fail why did we fail was the fault with chairman levitas no indeed not for 3 months he has attempted to get the information for 3 months we waited and indeed in the beginning the information was made accessible there came a time when the investigative staff of his subcommittee visited region ii in new york city and they were told no more files will be made accessible to you when asked why the answer was we have got orders from washington not to release any more files now we have a confrontation i disagree respectfully with my colleague from new york a good friend of mine that ample time was allowed if it was not for the fact that a citation was issued that a subpena was issued backed up with a contempt charge we would not have made the

members of congress imagine do not have the right to see those documents yet all of the staff employees and they could be gs5 or whatever have the right to look through those socalled sensitive

thousands of gallons of oil that they said was waste oil and was listed in the manifest as waste oil but which was heavily ladened with pcbs i will tell you where we got that information we got it from their own files we did not know where to find that information we picked out files at random but not at first because they denied us access so i learned a lesson the hard way i learned that indeed the agencies that we entrust to protect our loved ones and we have evidence of children playing in toxic chemicals and the gao has testified that there are as many as 50 000 dump sites in the country i do not think there is a more serious problem that we are going to be confronted with in this congress and i am disturbed that we spend titie trying to get the possession of documents when perhaps we should be spending more time at the root problem stopping the dumping of toxic wastes in this country only when we do that can we effectively cope with the cleanup problem but i must say

question about it if we go on into it and recognise that the average amount of savings bonds outstanding in fiscal year 1980 was 76 5 billion then we look at the enormity of the program that some are

which includes a unique and worldrenowned 300millionyearold fossilized coral reef which is the only place where the ohio river flows over bedrock these wetlands have also become nationally known among ornithologists as one of the most exciting places in the country to see migrating waterbirds waterfowl and shorebirds as well as an attraction for fishermen other outdoor enthusiasts archeologists and amateur collectors of artifacts perhaps no where else in the world is there an area which offers such geological ornithological archeological and paleontological distinctions within such close proximity to a major metropolitan area the coral reef of the falls is one of the finest horizontal exposures in the world of devonian fossil corals nearly 900 nominal species of fossil corals have been founded on specimens collected from approximately 150 feet of coral beds in the falls area corals from the falls of the ohio can be seen in almost every natural history museum in the world to those who understand its significance it is a natural wonder of the world a jewel a treasure house of the earths history yet it has never been protected and often it has been a victim of unknowing rock collectors who may hammer out some valuable specimen without realizing they are interfering with the hands of time actually the falls consisted of a series of rapids falling some 26 feet in a 2mile stretch beginning at a point near the mcalpine dam for many years before the dam and locks were built boats and barges heading downstream shot the falls at highwater with pilots who knew the dangerous course and its pitfalls they made a specialty of falls operation it was in 1817 that capt henry shreve with a canny eye on both the lawrobert fulton and robert livingstons steamship patent gave them a monopoly on the steamboat tradeand the falls built the giant g washington with a shrewd innovation that altered the course of commercial river operations instead of a tall oscillating vertical cylinder which required deep draft shreve subztituted a pair of fixed horizontal cylinders he could lay flat on deck that gave him a tongueincheek possible loophole from the language of the fultonlivingston patent but more importantly it gave him a shallow draft to run on the falls not in it captain shreve reportedly boasted i can run the falls in a heavy dew the falls is also a favorite habitat for wildlife among the birds spotted in the falls area are several species of sandpipers and herons the snowy egret piping plover bluewinged teal duck ringedbill gull and the common and black terns sf eral species of heron frequent the area stately great blue herons bring their young there to feed while little green herons nervously prowl the banks in the evenings vast numbers of elegant blackcrowned night herons wing their way into the area for their nightly sojourn the large pools and backeddies in the lower stretch of this portion of the river harbor large concentrations of

which has not been seen in kentucky in this century in past years as many as 75 species of birds including many waterfowl have been at the falls the migratory birds that pause and nest on the islands at the falls are an unmatched display of birdlife so far inland many of the birds that stop there breed in canada and alaska including arctic regions and spend their winters on the gulf coast and in central and south america the area still serves as a haven for some of the most diverse birdlife in the southeast shorebirds such as the sandpiper plover killdeer and snipe are commonplace early in the mornings and late in the evenings you can observe them skittering across the flats in search of food however in recent years a chief concern has been the dramatic decline in the population of these birds within recent years poachers with guns have killed many of the birds and driven off others egrets for example were familiar sights at the falls in the 1940s and 1950s but are no longer visitors there this decline in population levels has also been due largely to changes that were made in dam construction near the falls which has resuilted in excess silt accumulation and serves to dramatically highlight the urgent need to protect this area at the same location was a crossing of the ancient buffalo trace known to have been used by mastodons and by tens of thousands of buffaloes

famous as the wilderness road its northwestern extension through bullitt and jefferson counties carried pioneers past many of the salt licksas important to the settlers as to the animalsand then to

actually see them teeming in the shallows the catfish clan is well represented too blue channel flathead bullhead and white catfish abound in the waters yet despite the efforts for over 20 years by interested hardworking local groups plans to establish the falls as a bistate park have failed the legislation which i am introducing today represents an attempt to break the stalemate which currently

and under the leadership of the distinguished gentleman from california we brought the members a bill and of all the subject matter over which the house committee on agriculture has jurisdiction none is more controversial emotional or technical than is fifra and i think that is apparent to everyone we held hearings at different times on this legislation since june of 1981 and what we have before us we reported out of the committee in may of this year now as i indicated the provisions of the bill are generally very technical but especially this is true as to section 5 that my colleague from georgia wants to amend now the gentleman from georgia is a very resourceful legislator and a very able one and is my friend and he had opportunities to appear before our committee during the year that the bill was under consideration and i must confess i do not recall his appearance there at any time i do not mean to suggest that he was required to do so and that he does not have the right to offer his amendment here but i want to say that had he requested the opportunity to appear that i am certain the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from california and i would have discussed his problems at greater length than perhaps that which we are able to do now under the constraint of time i have had a chance to look briefly at his amendment he asks the administrator of the environmental protection agency to enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences and then he specifies a number of things that he directs the national academy to do no one in this chamber has a higher regard for the national academy of sciences than the gentleman from virginia they are one of out most prestigious scientific bodies but he asks among other things that the national academy determine the economic result of the disclosures of information under such section on the submitter of such information however i was not aware that the national academy of science had the expertise to make economic judgments and there are other deficiencies i think in what he is asking us to do in his amendment now my colleagues heard the colloquy earlier between the chairman the gentleman from california and i think he explained in response to the questions fromthe gentleman from florida that there are ways of obtaining access to innovative data and other material especially in emergency situations"], [0.9991298875538632, 0.0008701124461367726, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 6142 a bill to provide an impetus for the disposition of surplus stocks

mr sharp prospects for record grain production and carryover levels increasing acquisitions of grain under the price support activities of the commodity credit corporation a reversal in the long

grain handling and storage system as never before new storage facilities are being constructed at a rapid pace and the federal government is approving for commercial storage facilities that were once considered substandard and inadequate to miintain grain in proper condition not only are private stocks of grain held on the farm and in commercial elevators accumulating to record levels govbrnment stocks of farm commodities are also building rapidly as producers forfeit to the commodity credit corporation grain used to secure government price support loans by the end of the 198283 marketing year usda projects that cccowned stocks of corn will increase by at least 150 million bushels to nearly 400 million bushels the estimated firstyear cost to ccc of assuming ownership of a bushel of corn is estimated to be at least 0 80 per bushel when commercial storage rates transportation and handling charges forfeited interest on the loan and forgone firstyear interest revenue on the grain in ccc possession are considered in addition given current severe restrictions on cccs authority to return grain under its ownership to commercial markets as well as prospects for continued depressed farm prices in the near term ccc is likely to own this grain at substantial additional cost for some time one of the primary reasons that agriculture finds itself in a depressed state is the deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet milling process can obtain from one 56pound bushel of corn 2 5 gallons of anhydrous ethanol 1 7 pounds of corn oil 3 pounds of corn gluten meal a 60percent protein product 14 5 pounds of corn gluten feed a 21percent protein additive and 15 pounds of highgrade carbon dioxide in addition wetmilling facilities have the flexibility to reduce their ethanol production in favor or producing high fructose corn syrup in a dry milling facility 2 5 gallons of ethanol and nearly 17 pounds of a 26 to 32percent protein material call dried distillers grain ddg remain after the process according to a 1981 study by the unitedstates department of energys office of alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the increased employment national income and balance of payments benefits that would likely accrue to the united states if a strong alcohol fuels industry were established contrary to the current widely held perception sales of gasoline alcohol blend fuels have not declined in the face of the curent oil glut and period of moderate gasoline prices as the information in the tables below relates alcohol

in the house i promise to try to keep my remarks direct but i did want to make a special reference to some of the things that i saw and was involved in during this period of time that i think are worthwhile putting in the record i tried to do it in a way that will be quite concise and set forth the points that i have in mind so i sort of broke this apart and i said from 1971 to 1982 what were the biggest problems and perhaps the tragedies that i witnessed in this country and in this congress in that period of time i think the first on the list would have to be the war in vietnan and the tragedy that resultcd to hundreds of thousands of americansreally to millions of americans because the tragedy struck all of us and of course particularly to those many thousands who lost their lives in vietnam this was a tragedy that happened because of a number of circumstances the executive branch involvement at that time and the congress willingness to go along with the executive without questioning i think that we learned a great lesson from that tragedy and i am hopeful and believe that that type of thing will never happen again the second problem and tragedy would have to be watergate because watergate put this country through probably one of the most traumatic experiences that it has ever been through it dragged out as it had to in order to go through the process to a point that it was the main conversation the only thing that was in peoples minds in this country the real question was whether this democracy could survive a watergate the only good part of that whole problem was it could survive it showed that this democratic process was strong enough to take one of the toughest blows that had ever been administered to it and come up stronger than ever so while it was a tragedy it also showed a great strength the third greatest problem is the one that is facing us today and that is the problem of 12 million americans unemployed with an unfortunate indication that the numbers in the next months are even going to go higher this is a tragedy that i hope that we still in this congress in the 97th congross and particularly i hope in the 98th congress are going to take direct action on this is not a st and lets wait and see what is going to happen problem it is a problem that calls for us in the congress to do something about it i believe that when we look back on this period of time this unemployment problem will be equal in its tragedy to the other two problems that i have just mentioned now i also have been in the unusual situation as have many of my colleagues in this period of time to have served under four presidents it is a very unique period because of the reszignation of one of our presidents that we have had that number in a very short period of time i have made sort of a one liner on how my feelings are concerning the jobs that those four presidents have done and are doing so this does not pretend to be a complete analysis at all but just a very quick sort of shot of where i feel they are the first president i served under was president nixon and i would have to say about president nixon that he was probably one of the most competent presidents but the other side of the coin was that he was basically dishonest this government cannot survive a chief executive in office that has demonstrated the trait of dishonesty that was illustrated by the years of president nixon i was very criticized during that period of time for not immediately jumping into the forefront as many of my colleagues did in calling for the impeachment of the president i did not call for the impeachment because i felt that i was like a member of a grand jury sitting here in this house waiting for the evidence well when the tapes became available and the judiciary committee said that members of the congress could listen to those tapes i went and i spent 6 hours in a room listening to those tapes of the president when i came out there were a group of reporters from the ap and the up and many of the newspapers because they knew of my past reluctance to act on this they said congressman what would you do now i said i would vote to impeach the president because in those 6 hours i heard our president say the kind of things that i just felt were so terrible and so much against what this country stood for and particularly what the president stood for that i felt he would have to leave president ford very briefly i equate president ford and say here was a very decent and a very honest man and he was good for us in the period of time that he served he was a response that the congress really gave the country to what had happened with president nixon on president carter i felt that president carter was and is an extremely intelligent decent individual i felt that the big failing of president carter was that he never understood how to work with the congress and he never understood the relationship that the executive held with the total government because of that lack of understanding he lost his election on president reagan who is just at the midterm of his presidency i have simply said i believe the president is so rigid in his beliefs and so unbending until he has lost the fight that this is serving him very poorly and serving the country very poorly also i feel that he lacks in a very basic understanding of the peoples problems i do not really believe that he understands the suffering and the agony that some of the legislative measures that this congress passed a year ago have created for a great many people it is certainly my hope that in the last 2 years that realization and also the willingness to be more flexible and more yielding will show themselves and this country will profit by it and i am sure the congress will be glad to work with the president what were the biggest successes well i think one of the great success es in the congress was the enactment of the war powers act because that war powers act finally put the congress in a situation that said that when young americans are going to be committed in a war in a foreign country this congress is going to have a voice and say something as to what happens i think that was a gren success and it was very important for the american people another success was the gains mad in that period from 1971 to 1982 in education and the arts along with the recognition on the part of the federal government that we have a real responsibility that an educated young american is undoubtedly the greatest strength we have and that the development of the arts is something that is of the utmost importance for this country and for our civilization a third point is that during that period of time we really recognized the needs of the elderly and made gains for the elderly through the older americans act programs that responded to the needs of this large segment of the american public that has so long gone neglected another issue is the congressional awarenessand i do not mean this in a controversial senseof the agriculture programs of this country because i do not think it either served agriculture well or the congress or the people well to have a congress that traditionally until this period of time basically accepted the programs for agriculture without questioning them and without finding out what the implications were to the consumers of the country as well as to the farmers i think that the agriculture community and the consumers the total country will profit because of the recognition congress now has on these programs one last area is that in this period of time we saw the beginning really of community development programs urban programs and mass transit programs where the federal government recognized the need for their assistance in helping those areas and in helping the people of the country specifically in rebuilding and keeping their cities vital i have talked of the biggest successes briefly let me talk of what i she as the biggest failures one of the biggest failure over this period of time has been thz inability of the congress and the white house to work together for any period of time as a team as thbugh we were all working for the same good the fact is that that really has not happened another failure is the refusal of the congress to put a limit on campaign spending in congressional races and its refusal to let public financing of congressional races take place because i think more than any one factor we are going to find the continuing influence of substantial money controlling many elections i just am not convinced that that is ii the best interests of this country another area of failure has been the inability of the congress to change its rules to halt procedures that slow down or stop legislation from being acted on either to defeat legislation or to pass legislation one of the biggest wastes of time we go through in this congress everyday is that we generally vote for the approval of the journal we have a lot of demands on our time and we have a lot of things to do and yet we go through that charade everyday there are many many other examples of absolute waste of time in this house and also in the senate but i am not going to speak to the senate because the senates waste of time would far exceed anything we can come up with nevertheless i think we in the house have n e really addressed the problem effectively i also believe that the congress has not developed an overall solution of the energy problem that we have in this country or the problem of our sources of energy in the years to come it is certainly something to which we have to direct ourselves everytime we start getting to it the price of oil begins to drop a little and we shelve whatever those programs are another vitally important thing is the inability on the part of the congress or the executive to develop a national trade program what are we going to do to compete with foreign trade what is our program we have never had in the years that i have been here any consistent program that would let our manufacturers and our producers compete favorably with foreign producers and manufacturers any program that says this is the course of action we are going to take on trade is completely nonexistent and we desperately need it i guess i would have to list as the last failure the fact that the congress while it made many gains in education and in the arts unfortunately during this past session turned around and cut back on many of those gains and cut back on many of those programs that ultimately will hurt us and i am convinced that ultimately we will reverse that action finally let me give my personal overall reaction to having served in this congress many people have said to me as i am sure they have said to members all throughout the his iry of congress and for many many years it must be awfully frustrating down there well let me point out that there is no job that is not frustrating we have our frustrations but i do not know of any job in this country that has the rewards that this job has nor do i know of any job that can give one the kind of satisfaction that this job has given me so from my point of view this has undoubtedly during this period of time been the greatest period in my life and one that has given me more feeling of accomplishment than i think anything i could have done and to the members of the house who are continuing to serve and to the congresses that will follow let me say that i hope you share that feeling because it is going to be important not to look on this as a job but to look on this as an opportunity to serve this great country of ours and the great people that you represent so i leave the congress at this time but i leave it with a great feeling that it has been a great experience and one that i would urge my colleagues to stay with and to those of you who are not yet in the congress let me say that i hope you look to the future someday and plan on making the race to serve with these great men and women in the congress"], [0.9989890118595213, 0.0010109881404787302, 1, "i would

american grain embargo against the soviet union to date i have basically agreed with the administrations foreign policy the decision to lift the grain embargo however i believe was a mistake made because of unsound advice the president received from the agriculture department sending signals is characteristic of modern diplomacy the message of the embargo was to register condemnation of the soviet unions ruthless invasion of afghanistan the united states setting aside domestic political considerations demonstrated that as the leader of the free world it would sacrifice economic gain to protest soviet imperialism the embargo could have been better planned and implemented nevertheless there is no doubt that it seriously hurt the unitedstatess r s fragile economy t1wo consecutive years of poor harvests coupled with the embargo forced the soviets to spend an extra 1 billion in scarce foreign currencies to satisfy their grain needs moreover it caused them to slaughter much of their livestock because of a lack of feed grains leonid brezhnev himself noted that the country was having grave trouble supplying the cities and industrial centers with such foodstuffs as milk and meat the united states grain embargo forced the soviet union to pay premium prices to make up the grain deficit by purchases in other often more distant parts of the world lifting the embargo sends the wrong signals to our allies particularly in western europe how can we expect the west germans for example to take a tougher stance visavis the soviets and refrain from getting more deeply involved with them economically when we ourselves appear to be putting domestic economic rather than national security considerations first i believe that the embargo was one concrete action that told the soviets more about united states interests and intentions that a spate of anticommunist rhetoric in any case the fundamental issue is not how effective the embargo was but whether the united states wishes to continue to punish the soviets for their continuing slaughter of afghans thanks to the counsel of shortsighted agriculture interests the credibility of our foreign policy with respect to the unitedstatess r is now being seriously questioned we saw how credibility problems undermined the effectiveness of the previous administrations foreign policy we do not want to see this happen again the white house press office has laboriously explained lately that the grain embargo would be reimposed if the unitedstatess r should invade poland since that would suggest linkage is still a key

compliment the gentleman from illinois the gentleman from kentucky for this excellent piece of legislation along with the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from virginia this legislation is long overdue i think they have done a great job i certainly hope the members will give it the strongest support because we need this kind of legislation on the statute books the primary purpose of this measure is to enhance the protection of unitedstates intelligence operatives working under cover such legislation is of compelling urgency as there are individuals including former unitedstates intelligence officials who are busily and systematically engaged in efforts to destroy our intelligence capability by disclosing the identities of those clandestinely employed by the various unitedstates intelligence agencies an episode in jamaica illustrates what i am talking about in july of last year the homes of our embassys first secretary in jamaica and an aid employee were fired upon shortly after the american editor of covert action information bulletin claimed in a press conference that these unitedstates officials and 13 other americans as well as jamaicans were connected with the cia not only were tie names of these individuals disciosed but also their home addresses telephone numbers and auto license tag numbers fortunately unlike the cia station chief in athens who was killed in december 1975 after his cover was blown in a similar fashion by the migazine counter spy the american officials and families involved in tile kingston attack survived unscathed it was a close call however as twvo of the bullets penetrated the bedroom window of one of the children who was providentially away at the time with that as backdrop it is little wonder that our human intelligence collection efforts are in serious jeopardy around the world selfpreservation is a very basic instinct and wvhy should anyone want to be associated with an intelligence community that cannot provide adequate protection for those it asks to undertake dangerous assignments of significant national se curity import in evaluating the merits of this legislation i find former cia director william colby especially persuasivr when he while participating in an american enterprise institute panel discussion of intelligence matters observed that the journalists believe they should protect their sources i think our nation should protect its sources we need a discipline over our employees to make sure that when they undertake to keep the secrets they are going to learn whien they go to work for inteiiigence they darn weli keep them if they violate that trust they should be subject to criminal action there are thirtyodd statutes in our criminal code that punish government officers for revealing information they learned during the course of their workthe agricultural department employee who reveals the crop statistics for example and a variety of others our natioival secrets and the officers who serve their country are entitled to that same protection from someone who reveals them the soldier does not mind the enemy shooting at him but he certainly does not want a fellow american shooting at him the intelligence officer does not mind thle threat and the danger from the enemy or the foreign country but he cannot accept thle possibility that some american can freely reveal is name and endanger him finally i would like to address briefly the first amendment questions of this bill that have been raised by somec of my colleagues especially with respect to criminalizing disclosures of undercover intelligence identities by individuals who have never been affiliated with the unitedstates government of special concern in this regard are journalists this bill was drafted with great care and sensitivity to this issue and i believe has resolved it in a responsible and constitutionally acceptable manner such individuals can only be prosecuted under this legislation when it can be clearly demonstrated that the disclosure occured in the context of a practice of identification and disclosures intended to impair unitedstates intelligence capabilities this means that to be criminally culpable one would have to be engaged in the business of naming names like the publishers of the aforementioned covert action information bulletin or counter spy this approach makes eminently good sense and is consistent with the point made by justice oliver wendell holmes in the famous espionage act decision of 1919 thatthe first amendment 0 obviously was not intended to give immunity for every possible use of language 0 the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic also very relevant in this connection are the remarks of zechariah chafee a leading defender of free speech during his 37 years at the harvard lawv school and the uncle of the distinguished senator from rhode island who introduced the senate version s 391 of this bill in a book entitled free speech in the united states the elder cliafee wrote that the true boundary line of the first amendment can be fixed only when congress and the courts realize that the principie on which speech is classified as lawful or unlawful involves the balancing against each other of two very important social interests in public safety and in the search for truth every reasonable attempt should be made to maintain both interests unimpaired and the great interests in free speech should be sacrificed only when the interest in public safety is really imperiled and not as most men believe when it is barely conceivable that it may be slightly affected in war time therefore speech should be unrestricted by the censorship or by punishment unless it is clearly liable to cause direct and dangerous interference with the conduct of the war thus our problem of locating the boundary line of free speech is solved it is fixed close to the point where words will give rise to unlawful acts in sum what we have before us is practical commonsense legislation that addresses a problem of paramount national security importance while carefully insuring no genuine civil liberties are infringed upon i therefore urge its immediate passage it is the least we can do for those who literally put their lives on the line

contingents of the spanish army and air force in spanish morocco revolted against the government in madrid and launched a civil war that was to cost over 650 000 lives during a 34month period the rebels represented the falange a movement inspired in part by the fascist regimes of hitler and mussolini dominated by socialists and social democrats the democratic republican government had ruled since 1931 after the monarchy was overthrown by a bloodless coup in an attempt to contain the civil war the european powers agreed to refrain from intervening in spain the thenisolationist united states approved of the noninterventionist policy and in 1937 extended its own neutrality laws to civil wars this policy which included an arms embargo was unprecedented since legitimate governments had always been able to purchase arms during civil wars italy germany and fascist portugal first violated the nonintervention pledge the italians sent 60 000 volunteers into combat in spain while the nazis sent their condor legion which soon established fascist mastery in the air the nazi fliers tried out tactics they later used successfully in poland belgium holland and france in a relatively
