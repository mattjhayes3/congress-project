if were going to figure out how to get out and how to make sure we dont get here again this has been the worst economy since the great depression and we need to make sure that the mistakes that got us here are mistakes we avoid in the future our colleagues across the aisle have said the great issue in american politics now is between those who want big government and those who want small government the real issue is which side government is on and for too long government has not been on the side of working and middle class families who are trying to make an honest living who are trying to support themselves support their families do the right thing do something useful with their lives government has been on the side of people who were trying to make a killing by getting themselves into a position where they can take advantage of the economy where they can extract money they can loot the economy is what economists called rentseeking doing nothing particularly useful but just taking a piece of other peoples productive work there has been a lot of gloating in the last little bit about how successful the financial rescue has been and by many measures it has been the banks have not actually collapsed the financial system didnt collapse we did not have a great depression as painful as this has been but the financial collapse and the rescue profoundly offended americans sense of justice and it offended my sense of justice what led to the financial collapse was not some perfect storm of unforeseeable macroeconomic forces and this weird combination of events that no one could possibly have seen it really was the result as the fcic report concluded it was not just preventable it was the result of blameworthy conduct that we should never have allowed to happen i first got involved in this issue not knowing it would result eventually in a financial crisis through working on the issue of mortgages knowing that the mortgages were terrible for consumers for homeowners and the way that they had been portrayed as a goodfaith effort by the financial system to try to make home ownership available to people who could not otherwise afford it was completely different from what was really going on with subprime mortgages there was an explosive growth of subprime mortgages they grew from 8 percent of all mortgages in 2003 to 28 percent in 2006 that is enormous growth in just 3 short years and they certainly were not about helping people buy homes who otherwise could not have afforded home ownership in fact every study that has looked at it has concluded the great majority of people who got subprime loans qualified for prime loans they got cheated they got steered into loans that obviously were not in their interest they werent about helping people into home ownership in fact subprime was almost entirely a creature of refinances seventy percent even during that 2003 to 2006 period 70 percent were refinances people already owned their homes but they needed to borrow money some of them lived beyond their means there is no doubt about it some of them were using the equity in their home as an atm machine but the fact is for the last generation the means of middle class families have not been enough americans as the economy has grown as the nation has prospered that prosperity has not been widely shared as it has been in the past and so when americans got into trouble when they needed to borrow money from somewhere when someone in the family got sick when someone lost their job when they went through a divorce when they needed to borrow money the only way they could borrow money was to borrow it against their home to refinance their home seventy percent of subprime loans were refinances and again the great majority the wall street journal estimated 55 percent most of the other estimates have been more than that were people who qualified for prime mortgages ninety percent were not fixed rate 30year mortgages they had a quick reset after just 2 or 3 years so they were 2 28s or 3 27s most people who got those loans did not even know that they did not know that the initial mortgage payment that they had to make monthly payment was going to be subject to a very quick increase and the increase after just a couple of years was generally 30 to 50 percent a month to get out of the mortgage the great great majority had to pay a prepayment penalty usually like 3 percent of the outstanding balance of the mortgage now those were not mortgages that were designed to help middle class families those were mortgages designed to take the equity in their home to strip them of the equity of their home as house prices were going up there was never any thought that they really would be able to pay off those mortgages over the course of 30 years and then invite their friends and family over to have a ceremony where they would burn their mortgages as earlier generations of americans had done they were mortgages that had the effect of trapping people in debt and taking from them the equity in their home and making sure that that ended up in the pockets of the financial sector not in the pockets of the middle class families other practices in that last decade that should never have happened overdraft fees now overdraft fees serve a useful purpose in another generation we used the criminal laws to prosecute people who wrote bad checks there are a lot of perfectly honest folks who got themselves in just a little bit of trouble or didnt balance their checkbooks who ended up with prosecutions for writing bad checks but overdraft fees became a source of profit for banks a typical overdraft fee would be 40 bucks the biggest banks actually developed what was called fee harvesting software if you had an overdraft agreement and you had one unless you specifically asked not to have one and you went to an atm machine and you asked for your balance it wouldnt actually tell how much you had in your account it would say funds available that meant how much your balance was plus what they would allow in overdraft fees and they would run the bills through in a way that would maximize your overdraft fees so if you were like a lot of people and you got to the end of the month and there was more month than there was paycheck and you went to the atm and you had a hundred bucks in your account and you went to the atm machine and you took out 20 and then you took out another 20 and then you made a 20 purchase and then another 20 purchase with your debit card and then maybe a 15 purchase and then you wrote a 100 check or a 105 check the banks would put the 105 check through first putting you over your limit charging you a 40 overdraft fee on that and the 20 the 20 the 20 the 20 and the 15 now thats just crooked and that was

together with the president and with senator reid on the other side now you said before that this cr that is up now would prevent a government shutdown just the opposite is true it is a step backward it is going to lead directly toward a government shutdown because republican leadership knows that this bill will not pass the senate it doesnt have any cuts in defense it actually says we will keep the level of funding for defense until the end of the year well arent defense cuts on the table and it continues with this ideological battle there is actually abortion language in this cr is my understanding and the gentlewoman actually said well that is an issue here that we need to resolve that we should deal with well no that is not the case because if you continue on this path no defense cuts bring up abortion this bill will certainly not pass the senate the president will not sign it and so we are just simply wasting our time what is happening here is the republicans are ignoring the fact that there are democrats in the majority in the senate and there is a democratic president you cant have it my way or the highway and thats what we have been hearing for the last 3 months my way or the highway now i just want to mention another thing i was glad that the gentlewoman brought up the budget which is to follow because we know that this bad cr or spending bill that we are dealing with now is a precursor to an even worse budget bill that the republicans have proposed and i want to tell you you talked about a previous error the problem with the republican budget there are so many but the biggest problem is it is going to put an end to medicare i was here when speaker gingrich became speaker and he said he wanted medicare to wither on the vine and that is what the republican budget will do it will end medicare as we know it because there will be no guarantee seniors will go back to the old days when they had to try to find their own private health insurance and maybe the government will give them some help with it but for the most part they wont be able to find health insurance so there wont be medicare they wont be able to get health insurance and what are they going to do theyre going to be out on the street theyre going to end up in the emergency room again which is what happened with the elderly before we passed medicare the gentlewoman went on to say that shes going to reform medicaid well shes reforming medicaid by basically giving a block grant to the states and what does that mean the states wont have enough money to pay for seniors nursing home care so nursing homes will close or they wont provide quality services well see seniors getting bedsores again if they can even find a nursing home so essentially were also going to end medicaid sixtyfive percent of medicaid goes towards seniors and the disabled you look at this republican budget and this is just a precursor to what were going to see next week it will end medicare as we know it by eliminating its guaranteed coverage it slashes medicaid for seniors in nursing homes health care for children and americans with disabilities it increases the cost of a college education for close to 10 million middle class students it gives away billions in subsidies and tax breaks to big oil"], [0.0016089081764221191, 0.9983910918235779, 1, "my republican colleagues have put forth

repealing of the 1099 reporting requirements i do i have a record of supporting 1099 repeal and relieving americas small businesses from onerous paperwork and onerous regulations what im opposed to is paying for this small business tax bill by increasing taxes on working middle class americans and that is exactly what this legislation will do lets not kid ourselves democrats offered a different path last july we put forward legislation to repeal the 1099 reporting requirements and we paid for it by eliminating loopholes in the tax code that reward those exporting unitedstates jobs overseas and the senate has offered an alternative path as well last month they overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan repeal of the 1099 reporting requirement which did not include a tax increase on middle class workers but my republican colleagues in the majority here in the house who have continually preached lower taxes less regulation and fiscal discipline have refused either of these alternative approaches instead my republican colleagues are forcing a vote today on h r 4 a measure that will impose a 25 billion new tax on middle class families yes you heard that right it is only 59 days since my republican colleagues have assumed majority control of the house of representatives and theyre already breaking their campaign pledge of no new taxes a pledge that 234 of 241 sitting republican members of the house signed and no republicans are not taxing the wealthiest 1 percent to pay for this small business relief bill they are raising taxes on middle class workers like firefighters police officers nurses and teachers the very american families who work day in and day out to make their financial ends meet the very american families under attack today in wisconsin in indiana in ohio and across the midwest now the republicans will not admit that embedded in h r 4 is a tax increase on the middle class but the facts are the facts the joint committee on taxation says the republican bill is a tax increase citing how it will raise 25 billion in new revenue that is congressionalspeak for a tax increase even grover norquist the author of the taxpayer protection pledge has said americans for tax reform has always followed committee on joint taxation methodology yet still my republican friends deny and deny and deny but my friends read my lipsrepublicans are raising taxes just look at the contents of the bill under the democratic health reform law an american family of four earning 88 000 a year is obligated to pay no more than 9 5 percent of their income on health care premium costs in this example that is 8 360 that comes out of their pocket on a typical family policy valued at 13 000 so the family would pay out of their pocket 8 360 in annual premiums for their health care coverage and the federal government would provide a tax creditnot a subsidy not a subsidy a tax creditvalued at 4 640 to cover the rest these are not subsidies but tax credits to working people they work exactly like the child tax credit or the tax credit to make college more affordable how many of all of our constituents use those tax credits do they believe it is welfare a form of welfare i dont think so they understand the difference between a subsidy and a tax credit these are not subsidies for the middle class they are tax credits for the middle class these are tax relief measures for the middle class the affordable care act also ensures that the federal funding going towards a familys health premium is paid directly to the insurance carrier to the insurance company not to the family in short the family receiving this tax credit will never ever personally touch that money not a single dime do they feel it never transfers through them however under the republican bill h r 4 if that very same family that earns 88 000 the breadwinner of the family is called into the bosss office and the boss says you know what youre on your track to management youre doing such a great job were going to give you a 250 bonus take the family out to dinner its the holiday season and youre overjoyed you go back to your family and say i am management material i got a 250 bonus im taking everybody out to dinner tonight well heres the rub you would go from the 398 percentile of the federal poverty level to the 401 percentile of the poverty level when that happens you would then owe the federal government for that 250 in april of the next year the federal government would say not so fast you owe us 4 640 to make up for your having accessed those tax credits thats right they would have to pay back every single dime that went directly to that health insurer to that health insurance company when a dime never crossed their fingers not a single dime crossed

havent done a poor jobthey havent done anything it is as if they are not in favor of americans having jobs we know they are but they havent demonstrated it in anything they have done which is the important thing instead as part of the republican no jobs agenda they bring up a bill to cut 1 million jobs cut 1 million jobs from the american middle class these cuts are republican answers for the job crisis that they created cutting 1 million jobs if you are a nurse no jobs if you are a teacher no jobs if you are a firefighter or police officer no jobs if your jobs are from american manufacturing no jobs and if you are a small business person who is going to have any money to even go into your store no jobs for them either the list goes on and on if you want to know how we cut

they are cutting medicaid until they cease to exist republicans want working americans to shoulder the whole burden the burden of a taxpayerfunded spending spree for the rich while protecting

took during the 8 years of the bush administration thats why youre here and the other freshmen who have come to the floor you werent here for this tirade of spending you said youd cut up the credit card so were going to cut up the credit card for the va hospitals after 35 000 men and women have been wounded serving us honorably in iraq and afghanistan now look i voted against the war in iraq and i voted against the bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 now a fact not opinion bill clinton says goodbye and there is a 5 7 trillion surplus he balanced budgets four times in 5 years it has only happened five times since the end of world war ii the gentleman from arizona is one of the few republicans who will come to the house with a straight face and say let me tell you how we got here he knows how we got here mr gingrey is a friend and he knows how we got here you cant cut taxes by 2 3 trillion and fight two wars and honor the commitment we have to those men and women who have served us honorably in iraq and afghanistan while i was against the tax cuts and while i was against the war in iraq im going to vote for those appropriations to take care of those veterans hospitals you dont cut up the credit card when they come back you use good judgment before you send them off what happened here during those 8 years with the prescription drug benefit what happened during those 8 years with weapons of mass destruction what happened with tax cuts by the way the corresponding argument on those tax cuts is tax cuts pay for themselves well guess what were staring at a 15 trillion deficit and debt because of those reckless fiscal practices that took place for the republican party to make these arguments today about this issuewhich by the way mr flake is correct about againis but a charade you meet your obligations you pay your bills thats what the credit card is about and not to pontificate in front of this chamber today about reckless spending when for 8 years nobody had

24 fuel convoys represents casualties were spending 24 billion a year to protect convoys to forward operating bases in afghanistan and 65 percent of all electricity on bases in afghanistan is for air conditioning and heating leaky tents reducing this fuel use is a simple way to reduce fuel convoys which reduces costs and casualties and this amendment requiring a report on energy efficiency and
