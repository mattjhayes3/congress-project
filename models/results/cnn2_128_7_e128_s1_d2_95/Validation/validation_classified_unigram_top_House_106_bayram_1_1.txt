doubt the most serious social political problem of our age the lack of respect for life that permits abortion has significantly contributed to our violent culture and our careless attitude toward liberty as an obstetriciangynecologist i can assure my colleagues that the partialbirth abortion procedure is the most egregious legally permitted act known to man decaying social and moral attitudes decades ago set the stage for the accommodated roe vs wade ruling that nationalizes all laws dealing with abortion the fallacious privacy argument the supreme court used must some day be exposed for the fraud that it is reaffirming the importance of the sanctity of life is crucial for the continuation of a civilized society there is already strong evidence that we are indeed on the slippery slope toward euthanasia and human experimentation although the real problem lies within the hearts and minds of the people the legal problems of protecting life stems from the illadvised roe v wade ruling a ruling that constitutionally should never have occurred the best solution of course is not now available to us that would be a supreme court that would refuse to deal with the issues of violence recognizing that for all such acts the constitution defers to the states it is constitutionally permitted to limit federal courts jurisdiction in particular issues congress should do precisely that with regard to abortion it would be a big help in returning this issue to the states h r 3660 unfortunately takes a different approach and one that is constitutionally flawed although h r 3660 is poorly written it does serve as a vehicle to condemn the 1973 supreme court usurpation of state law that has legalized the horrible partialbirth abortion procedure never in the founders wildest dreams would they have believed that one day the interstate commerce clause written to permit free trade among the states would be used to curtail an act that was entirely under state jurisdiction there is no interstate activity in an abortion if there were that activity would not be prohibited but rather protected by the original intent of the interstate commerce clause the abuse of the general welfare clause and the interstate commerce laws clause is precisely the reason our federal government no longer con forms to the constitutional dictates but instead is out of control in its growth and scope h r 3660 thus endorses the entire process which has so often been condemned by limited government advocates when used by the authoritarians as they constructed the welfare state we should be more serious and cautious when writing federal law even when seeking praiseworthy goals h r 3660 could have been written more narrowly within constitutional constraints while emphasizing state

could we build a tax system that would punish people for earning and working hard a system that would be obstructive of capital formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades the privacy of every single american citizen there are 100 000 people at the

also establishes a bipartisan national commission on tax reform and simplification that is required to report to congress on a new fair simpler tax code the overall intention of this bill is to do three things one sunset the current convoluted tax code two create a commission to consider alternative tax systems and three foster a national debate on how to create a fair tax system for working

see exactly what they are paying in taxes and the embedded costs of the irs would be gone because the irs would be gone americans would be able to take their entire check home with them and the irs would be shut down unlike the relatively simple tax return that you would get if we move toward a flat tax under our system we would have no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let me simply say that any of these proposals as i said earlier any of these tax reform changes would be better than the current system i welcome the debate that will

flexibility in determining how to use federal education funds h r 800 is a bill which will expand the program to give all 50 states the optionto apply for edflex in short edflex increases local control reduces government red tape and promotes flexibility with accountability my state texas was one of the first states to win edflex status since january of 1996 texans have incorporated the flexibility granted under edflex for statewide comprehensive reform programs centered around local control and accountability for results governor george w bush eagerly sought edflex status and has worked with local educators for the authority to design programs which meet and address local need texas also has implemented a system which ensures that there is accountability with concrete results in return for this increased flexibility as governor bush said texans can run texas i believe that each of my colleagues would feel the same way about their respective states and their districts

fifth year as a member of congress from oklahoma i am also in my last term as a selfimposed term limit on myself one of the reasons i think that we only have 40 percent of the people voting in elections is that in fact there is a crisis of confidence in the congress of the united states i want to spend some time tonight outlining what we have heard many people say whether it is the president in his state of the union speech or others in terms about our budget this socalled surplus that does not exist explain to the american people why it does not exist and what it is really made of and then talk about some of the facts of the last 3 or 4 years of what has gone on and what we can expect in the future if in fact we do not have honesty with the american public in terms of our budget the budget process and speaking honestly about where american tax dollars go i also might add that besides being a medical doctor who continues to practice and deliver babies on the weekends and the days that we are not in session my original training is as an accountant i can tell my colleagues there is not an accountant in this country that would sign off on the books of the federal government the reason is because it moves money around it does not account for it it uses the same money twice and then claims it as a surplus to start this discussion i really want to try to explain to the american public the social security trust fund most people are paying 12 5 percent half of it themselves half of it by their employers in to fund the social security system at the present time we have a significant excess number of dollars coming in above and beyond what is required to pay out benefits for our seniors under social security what really happened is we are collecting more than we are spending in terms of social security dollars what happens now is that the federal government uses the excess social security money to pay for more spending and to pay off publicly held debt but as they pay off publicly held debt they incur another debt and that is an iou to the trust fund that says we will pay this back that also incurs interest the fancy way washington talks about that is that that is a surplus in fact it is only a surplus in that we have transferred the obligation to our children and grandchildren and they will pay that back through increased payroll taxes so we put ious that are credited to the trust fund in 2013 we face a major problem and that is the year in which the revenues that come into the social security trust fund will be less than the payments that we have to pay out what is going to happen then social security spends more than it collects in order to pay all the social security benefits social security is going to have to try to collect from the federal government on the ious the money the congress has borrowed what happens having spent all the money the federal government has to raise the income taxes or the payroll taxes on the people who are paying social security taxes just to meet the obligations that is borne out a little bit better when we actually see what the social security administration says about what is going to happen to the fund as you can see all this in red is actually money coming in to social security in excess of what we are paying out you will notice in 2013 we actually spend more money but if you go out to the end of this graph what you will see is we are getting close to 750 billion more a year in payments from general tax revenues or increased raises in the tax paid on hourly wages in this country we have a terrible picture developing i say all this because the politicians in washington claim we have a surplus there is no surplus the money that they are using to pay down external debt is actually money they are going to be obligating our grandchildren for with a treasury iou that is interestbearing that money is a false surplus all it is is the difference between what we paid out and what we have collected versus what we have spent more in other revenues that the federal government has taken in we are going to have only three options in 2013 and better we only have three options now to fix this problem one we can save 100 percent of the social security surplus and we can transition to a system that increases the earnings for all payments on social security between now and 2013 and thereafter the annualized yield the return on the investment on social security over the last 20 years has been less than 1 percent we would have been better to put it in a passbook savings account by 300 percent in terms of the power of compound interest had we done that we would have displaced this day of reckoning where the imbalance in payments out versus revenue in would have been at least delayed another 10 to 12 maybe even 15 years had they gotten some return i think the other point that needs to be made why are we in trouble on social security we are in trouble on social security because politicians easily spend your money without coming and saying were going to give you an increased benefit but were not going to tell you that your children and grandchildren are going to have to pay that back how do they pay that back they pay that back by lowering their standard of living and sending more of their hardearned dollars to washington to pay for the benefits today that we did not have the courage to tell the american public that for this benefit this increase in benefit we have to pay for it what is easy to do in washington i have found in 5 years is to pass on a benefit and not be responsible for paying for it it is called spin the real thing it is called is a halftruth a halftruth my daddy taught me was a whole lie we have seen a lie the second option we have we can repay the money from the trust fund by raising income taxes we are at the highest rate of taxing the american public that we have ever been with the exception of world war ii almost 22 percent of our gross domestic product is now consumed by taxes in this country that is not a good option the third option is we can change the retirement system we can delay the onset we can decrease the benefits that is just like we have done to the veterans we promise one thing and then we deliver far less it is not a principle of integrity to do something less than what you commit to do so we only have three options when we are faced with social security i want to just develop this for about another 5 minutes and then i will recognize the gentleman from minnesota now we hear washington say we have a surplus but the fact is is every day 275 million is added to the national debt if we have a surplus if we have more money coming in than we are paying out how come the debt for our children and grandchildren is rising it is because we are not honest in our bookkeeping we are not honest about it in 1997 each citizens share of the national debt was 19 898 by the end of this year every man woman and child from baby to grandmom will owe 20 693 you cannot have a surplus and the debt rise the question that the american people should ask when they hear the word surplus is did the debt go down there is another tricky word that the politicians use they say publicly held debt because that is the debt that is external to the internal ious that the government has paid or made with social security so it is true that the externalheld debt of the united states went down but only because we took money from the social security trust fund and wrote another iou so the total debt in terms of the social security increased revenues or excess revenues have not changed at all we have just decided we are not going to pay ourselves and we will slow down the pain to those people on the outside so less debt is held by the public that is true but the total debt is rising and as my colleagues can see it is rising 275 million per day and where i come from 275 million is one whole heck of a lot of money it is about enough to run the state of oklahoma for a month so we are talking about huge sums of money again i would make the point washington says we have a surplus if we have a surplus why is the debt that our grandchildren and children are going to have to bear rising why is it going up it is because we are not honest in our bookkeeping another way of looking at that and this chart shows exactly what we have seen and heard about 1998 is what i call the politicians surplus here is what we claim was a surplus the washington establishment but as my colleagues will note here is the debt in 1997 what has happened to the debt the debt went from 5 325 trillion to close to 5 440 trillion almost a 120 billion increase so if the surplus was 60 some billion dollars how come the debt went up 120 billion look what is projected in 1999 we are going to have this great big surplus that everybody wants to save or spend in a certain way but look what the debt projection is these are not my numbers these are from the congressional budget office a nonpartisan agency made up and influenced by both democrats and republicans and they are saying the debt is going to continue to rise despite this surplus so i think we can see that there is a lack of honesty about our budget policy and there is only one answer it is called restrained spending we have to be fiscally disciplined in the money that comes to the federal government the other thing i have learned is that if we leave money in washington do my colleagues know what happens to it it gets spent somebody always has a goodidea on a way to spend the money except the money we are spending now we are stealing from the social security system and we are transferring a lowered standard of living to our children and what we can see under president clintons budget and this is real numbers by the congressional budget office under the budget that he proposes to see that there is no surplus the red indicates real deficit in terms of moneys in versus moneys out and even though all sides of the aisle democrat republican and the president are claiming the surplus we can see from here that one does not exist even with a conservative plan that restrains spending we are still going to see a deficit up until about 2000 it may be that the economy is good enough that we may see a real surplus this year but look at the difference if we restrain spending in terms of real surplus in other words something that will actually slow down the growth and the debt decrease the debt decrease or in an inverse increase the standard of living for our children that if in fact we will restrain spending that in fact we will markedly help the children of tomorrow mr gutknecht"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.999998830755203,

government and the recognition by the united states of that government for purposes of carrying on a governmenttogovernment relationship this bill provides that the indigenous native people of hawaiinative hawaiiansmight have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous native people of the united statesamerican indians and alaska nativesto give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance it is also important to note that the united states congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of native hawaiians these federal laws provide for the provision of health care education job training the preservation of native languages the protection of native american graves and the repatriation of native american human remains thus the reorganization of a native hawaiian govemment would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve native hawaiians nor would the reorganization of a native hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of american indians and alaska natives for the last 90 years native hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations some have asked whether the reorganization of a native hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming the answer to that question is a simple no the indian gaming regulatory act authorizes indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on indian reservations or indian lands held in trust by the united states and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law but there are no indian tribal governments in hawaii nor are there indian reservations or indian lands and the state of hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming in developing and refining this measure we have worked not only with the a community but with representatives of the federal and state governments with leaders of the alaska native and native american communities and with the congressional caucuses the bill that is before the house today has been revised as a fesult of the testimony received at the hearings in hawaii and in washington d c our objectives are simple and straightforward as a matter of federal policy and federal law we want to assure that the united states government deals with all of the indigenous native people of the united states in a consistent mannerrecognizing and supporting their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance this is the right thing to do and i am honored to play a part in the passage of this measure i ask my colleagues for their support i yield such time as she may

fallen victim to partisan political posturing that is unfortunate because msas will insure the uninsured allow for choice of a doctor and put the health care decisions in the hands of the individual not a managed care administrator six years ago along with a dozen of my democratic colleagues i cosponsored legislation to create medical savings accounts in fact democrats were the initial sponsors of msas and msas unanimously passed the house committee on ways and means in 1994 during the debate on the clinton health care plan however after the republicans took over congress msas became a partisan football that was used to polarize the house of representatives but i want to make medical savings accounts a bipartisan issue once again so the gentleman from texas and i have introduced h r 614 the medical savings account efficiency act of 1999 this bill repeals the 750 000person cap that was placed on msas by the 1996 kennedykassebaum health insurance act and it makes medical savings accounts permanent thereby repealing the year 2000 sunset of msas repealing the 750 000 cap is significant in that many insurers have been reluctant to offer msas because these restrictions limited the size of the market in which msas could be offered therefore insurers will mass market msas and make millions of americans aware of the benefits of medical savings accounts by opening up msas to all americans msas would encourage savings for health care by forcing doctors and hospitals to compete for patients who are concerned about quality and cost health care spending will slow down likewise msas will provide a real incentive to shop around for the best values and alternatives when nonemergency treatment is needed the incentive consumers will keep the money they save critics of msas claim that this incentive will lead healthy people to choose msas leaving sick people in a separate and therefore more expensive health insurance pool but while many healthy people will choose to save the money the sick will also choose msas because their outofpocket cost will be less in addition msas are not just for the wealthy a gao study found that onethird of all new msas are opened by previously uninsured individuals these are additional reasons that msas are good for the consumer medical savings accounts will reduce administrative overhead as small bills will be settled and paid directly between provider and consumer they will also increase the record low savings rates of americans lastly msas provide an incentive to stay healthy preventive medicine will be encouraged these are the reasons i supported msas back in 1994 when i first heard about them and these are the reasons i support medical savings accounts today so i say to my colleagues as we wade into health care reform in the 106th congress include medical savings accounts in any health insurance measure that will come out of this congress because medical savings accounts will cut cost provide choice promote

but in the discussions that have been held over the years i think it is really unfortunate that so much of this comes from a theoretical discussion which is purported to be a government report called the gao study i think that it is important when we look at these studies to look at the response the department made with respect to each one of the assumptions that were propounded by the gao report the most significant of it is this use of the words world price anyone who has studied this particular issue will know that the world price is nothing more than a dump price there is no such thing as buying sugar at 8 cents or 9 cents a pound it is only where the excesses the surpluses of all of these government programs all over the world have no internal domestic source to sell then they go out to the world market and they dump it it is absolutely unfair to talk about our sugar program and relate it to the world dump price if we are talking about the cost of sugar to an ordinary family in the united states let us look at the chart here let us look and see what the world price is for sugar in the developed countries we see all of these countries here norway belgium denmark austria italy sweden switzerland ireland france all of these other countries and way down at the bottom here the united states retail price at 43 cents at the top here 86 cents that is what we are talking about when we talk about the cranberry production and the cranberry juice that we were supposed to feel sympathetic about in an earlier discussion we are talking about a retail price in the united states which is significantly lower than what the price is in other countries throughout the world 8 cent 9 cent sugar is unreal in terms of our own domestic market what are we talking about we are talking about killing an industry i cannot think of anybody interested in fairness and support of our farmers in support of agriculture wanting to kill a whole industry in order to somehow fall prey to this mythological idea that they could buy 8 cent sugar in the world dump market it is just not happening i think the real way to look at this situation is what is happening to the sugar prices today we who have sugar production in our districts know that the price has catapulted from about half of what they were perhaps 10 or 15 years ago our farmers are struggling they are in despair i have one sugar company on the island of kauai that is about to close if we do not find a resolution to this problem none of the hawaii sugar is in this commodity market i am not here because we are in that market where we are going to benefit 1 penny from any loan we are restricted from that program but i am here talking about sugar as fundamental industry in this country that has a right to exist to be a part of our economy as any other farm product in this the united states why kill off this industry on a myth prices have gone down over the last year to maybe 18 cents for the people who are producing it but what happens to all of the other products that are using sugar the cakes and the cookies and the cokes all the prices have gone up 15 20 percent there is no economist worth his salt or her salt that can argue that the price of sugar being low is a good thing for america because it is going to lower the prices of the commodities it has not li 1515 the prices of all of these commodities have gone up so the argument that the gao makes that the consumers are paying through their nose because sugar is such an expensive item has absolutely no substance in terms of the rationale for their argument if their argument were true then the prices for all of these commodities cakes cookies and whatever would have gone down there is not one item that we can find on the shelf today in the grocery stores where the prices have gone down that uses sugar as a substance for their production so it seems to me that we have to be together in this discussion about agriculture we cannot pick out one particular farmer we do not have any multibillionaire sugar producers in my state they are all small hardworking farmers who are just making a living so let us stand for the agricultural industry in this country and not kill sugar because somebody does not like the law that we passed in 1996 that was designed to benefit all commodities we have heard a lot of misinformation today about the unitedstates sugar program i want to present a few facts during the 1990s wholesale refined sugar prices fell 11 percent during the same period the retail price of refined sugar increased by 1 percent and the prices of manufactured food products with sugar as a major ingredientcandy baked goods cereal and ice creamrose by 23 to 32 percent since the start of the 1996 farm bill wholesale refined sugar prices are down 26 percent but retail sugar prices have not dropped at all and sweetened products prices are up 7 to 9 percent it is clear that it someone is making a killing it is not the sugar farmers american sugar farmers are in crisis in my state of hawaii only three sugar companies are still operating in 1986 13 operating factories were operating and sugar was grown on all of the four major islands today sugar is produced only on the islands of maui and kauaiand the survival of these companies and the fragile rural economies of these islands are severely threatened by historically low prices this year hawaii sugar farmers are receiving the lowest prices in 18 years for their sugar those who would like to kill the unitedstates sugar program cite the socalled world price of sugar of 8c a pound no onenot even countries that use child laborproduces raw sugar for 8o a pound this world price is in fact a dump price for excess sugar that bears no relationship to the actual cost of producing sugar the dump market represents the subsidized surpluses that countries dump on the world market for whatever price that surplus sugar will bring a study by lmc international estimated the weighted world average cost of producing sugar during the 11year period of 1983 84 through 1994 95 to be 18 040 a pound the actual level is almost certainly higher now because of inflation since that time even though unitedstates sugar growers are among the most efficient in the world they cannot survive when they receive prices on the order of 170 to 190 a pound twothirds of the worlds sugar is produced at a higher cost than in the united states even though american producers adhere to the worlds highest govemment standards and costs for labor and environmental protections unitedstates beet sugar producers are the most efficient beet sugar producers in the world and american cane producers rank 28th lowest cost among 62 countriesalmost all of which are developing countries with deplorable labor and environmental practices unitedstates consumers pay 20 percent less for sugar than the average for developed countries our average retail price for a pound of sugar43 is far below the more than 80e paid by consumers in norway japan and finland the average price paid by consumers in the european union is 520 of course unitedstates prices would be even lower if the retailers and manufacturers did not absorb all of the benefit of the lower prices producers have been receiving over the past three years is the price of sugar a problem for the average american family i dont think so sugar is so cheap that you can pick up packages of it in restaurants and no one cares the average american works 2 3 minutes to purchase a pound of sugar are the opponents of the unitedstates sugar program responding to concerns of consumers clearly not they are responding to pressure from big businesses that want to increase their profits further still at the expense of american farmers the dan miller amendments use consumer cost as an issue to mask the primary motive which is allow cheap foreign sugar into the unitedstates market so that the mega foodconglomerates can make more money the unitedstates sugar and corn sweetener producing industry accounts directly and indirectly for an estimated 420 000 american jobs in 42 states an for more than 26 billion per year in economic activity defeat the miller amendments that seek to destroy the unitedstates sugar industry i also wan tot respond specifically to the contention by mr miller that the unitedstates sugar program costs consumers 1 9 billion per year first the deeply flawed study by the gao has been thoroughly discredited by the usda economists at the usda have serious concerns about the gao report which suffers in a numbers of regards relative to both the analytical approach and the resulting conclusions usda concluded gao has not attempted to realistically model the unitedstates sugar industry the validity of the results are therefore suspect and should not be quoted authoritatively as with the 1993 version of this report the gao assumes that food retailers and manufacturers would pass every cent of savings along to consumerswe have convincing evidence that this will not happen mr miller is also very critical of the moves by the usda to remove excess sugar from the domestic market in order to stabilize the price of sugar and thereby avoid very expensive forfeitures several factors account for the excess of sugar on the market good yields due to favorable weather increased imports and schemes that undercut the foundation of the sugar import quota such as importation of stuffed molasses a product with a high sugar content which is made into refined sugar and importation of dumped sugar via mexico under the reduced nafta tariffs the miller amendments to prevent the usda from making purchases to reduce the supply of sugar and to avoid forfeitures will cost the government money purchases cost less per ton and will avoid a much larger volume of forfeited sugar purchases instead of forfeitures for the 132 000 tons the government purchased this year will save taxpayers 6 million in avoided forfeitures sugar farmers like other farmersare suffering prices for most crops are at or near alltime lows the government has stepped in to avert a disaster in rural america by providing over 70 billion in payments to other farmers since 1996but no assistance has been given to sugar farmers moreover sugar farmers have contributed 288 million in marketing assessments to reduce the deficit and prior to the recent sugar purchase the sugar program has operated at no cost to the unitedstates treasury it angers me to hear members talk about the sugar program benefitting only a few wealthy sugar barons i can tell you that the small growers who supplied the now defunct hilo coast processing company were not and are not sugar barons now many are not even farmersthey are unemployed and the thousands of people who work for or whose jobs depend on the remaining sugar companies in hawaii are not rich they work hard at their jobs and have to pay their mortgages and save to send their children to college in hawaii we have over 6 000 jobs dependent on the sugar industry these are good jobs that pay a living wage include health benefits retirement and other benefits unitedstates sugar producers are providing these jobs while complying with unitedstates labor and environmental law unitedstates consumers benefit from the unitedstates sugar program they benefit from the stability it ensures and the access it provides to quality sugar produced by unitedstates companies a strong domestic sugar industry contributes to our economy by producing jobs the demise of the unitedstates sugar industry would mean the loss of these jobs to sugar producers overseas that do not have labor or environmental protections and in documented cases use child labor to produce cheap sugar are we willing to forsake our own sugar producers so that the international food cartels can buy cheap sugar produced by twelve yearolds in brazil or guatemala i hope not in hawaii the decline in sugar prices has been ruinous these prices threaten the survival of our remaining sugar companies and the livelihood of workers in our rural areas sugar production ended on the island of hawaii several years ago nothing has replaced sugar as a viable agricultural crop and the former cane lands remain idle unemployment is high and drug problems have increased as have the social costs of dealing with these issues the islands of maui and kauaiwhere the sugar industry is a major source of employmentwill face the same devastating consequences if we do not give sugar farmers a fair price i urge my colleagues to reject the false consumer cost argument based on the gao report and vote today for a unitedstates sugar industry that will continue to provide jobs here in

the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools

supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to

bicentennial commission act abraham lincoln is rightly considered one of americas greatest presidents he occupied the white house through 4 of our countrys darkest years and was faced with the prospect of uniting our country torn asunder by civil war through his leadership and perseverance our country and system of government was preserved while it is impossible to overlook his contributions to america from the white house there is much more to the story of abraham lincoln that endears in the hearts and minds of his countrymen lincoln was born to humble roots in hodgenville kentucky located within my district he was largely selfeducated yet became one of our countrys greatest statesmen with his eloquent use of the english language he clung to the highest ethical standards throughout his political career earning the nickname honest abe he was fiercely devoted to his family and he put the interests of his country above his own which ultimately led to his assassination he was born into obscurity but earned the gratitude and love of his countrymen lincolns story is one of america and it serves as an inspiration to all of us it is a story all posterity needs to learn and it is incumbent on the federal government to use all available resources to preserve his legacy to borrow a quote from one of his most famous addresses it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this i urge my colleagues to support the abraham lincoln bicentennial commission act as edwin stanton said upon the presidents death now he belongs to the ages we have an opportunity today to make sure president lincoln remains a man for the ages by passing this legislation it is my hope that this commission will be able to conduct one of its meetings in hodgenville

eastern shore might represent the area around the c d canal whereas i represent along with the gentleman from maryland and the gentleman from maryland the port of baltimore although none of us can judge what the army corps will or will not do in their studies we all acknowledge those of us who represent the port of baltimore how important it is to maintain and strengthen the entry into the baltimore port l0 1700 the baltimore port is unique it is more inland than the east coast ports but because of that it takes more time to get to the port of baltimore the fact that we have two days to enter and exit the port is one of the key advantages to the port of baltimore the maintenance of the c d canal is absolutely essential to the health of the port of baltimore the port of baltimore represents 18 000 direct jobs 87 000 portrelated jobs 69 000 indirect jobs in our region and 1 3 billion annually to maryland business revenues are affected by the port of baltimore 40 million in unitedstates custom receipts so the majority of our delegation the overwhelming majority of our delegation is going to ask this body to reject the gilchrest amendment because it could jeopardize very much the health of the port of baltimore as my friend the gentleman from maryland pointed out we authorized this project several years ago by unanimous support within our delegation democrats republicans support the maintenance of our channels my colleague the gentleman from maryland mentioned the environmental issues the chesapeake bay we are all working very hard on the chesapeake bay i am proud of the work that my constituents are doing on the streams that lead into the bay we have worked very hard at the state level and the national level to deal with the bay but to raise the issue of maintaining decent entry or exits to our ports as compromising the bay is an insult to the army corps an insult to those of us who worked very hard on this issue the army corps is going to release its report the gentleman from maryland is absolutely correct my colleague is more concerned i think about where the dredge materials are being placed than the actual dredging within the c d canal all of us in our delegation strongly support the independence of the army corps in reaching the right decision as to the environmental risks involved we also believe it is the army corps responsibility to go through the economics of it and come out with the right conclusion we set up the army corps as our agents in this matter and now the gentleman from maryland is saying we cannot trust the army corps let us at least let the process move forward this is not a local project that affects one congressional district in this country this is a project that affects the health of our region that is why we are going to find that the overwhelming majority democrats and republicans in our region in our state are going to oppose the gilchrest amendment we ask members to respect our delegations point of view respect the fact that we need to maintain a healthy and competitive and safe port safety is very much at issue here we will do nothing to compromise our environment we are all committed to it i

campaign finance disclosure i am proud to be an original cosponsor of the proposal he discussed recently and i hope it will quickly be approved by the committee on ways and means many americans have lost faith in our political system routinely half of those eligible to vote do not people feel our political system is at best irrelevant and at worst shot full of corruption our country is better than that and our people deserve better last september the house of representatives overwhelmingly passed the shaysmeehan bill which would have dramatically reformed the campaign finance system it would have rid our system of soft money and severely limited independent expenditures but similar efforts died by a narrow majority in the senate though shaysmeehan remains a necessary reform a new type of political organization threatens the integrity of our campaign finance process our electoral process known as 527s and named after the provision of the tax code under which they are created these organizations contend they can accept unlimited funds and never disclose the names of donors the amount of contributions or how the money is spent this is possible because while these groups qualify as political committees under the tax code they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal election commission these organizations have caught the eye of many observers not the least of which is the joint committee on taxation when i was running for congress people told me how fed up they were with the system public cynicism and apathy eat away at voter participation and cause citizens to tune out of discussions of very serious issues it has turned a whole generation of young people away from politics as a means of governance and social change simply put the current campaign laws alienate voters i am hoping this legislation or new legislation i drafted will begin to restore public trust and will also take congressional seats off the 527 auction block this bill

to object i will not object i strongly support repeal of the social security earnings limit and do not intend to unduly delay action on this bill in fact repeal of the earnings limit has been part of the comprehensive social security reform legislation that the gentleman from arizona and i have introduced in the last two congresses however i rise in reservation to this unanimous consent request to express my disappointment that we are considering legislation that will increase social security benefits without even discussing the longterm financial challenges facing social security we should have spent the last year working on a comprehensive plan to strengthen social security that would restore solvency reduce unfunded liabilities give workers greater control of their retirement income improve the safety net and reward work but we both the president and congress have ignored our opportunity to deal with the longterm challenges facing social security if we are going to pass this legislation increasing costs outside of the context of reform we should at least be talking about ways to bring more attention to the challenges that remain the gentleman from arizona and i had hoped to offer an amendment regarding the recent recommendations of the social security advisory board which would more directly confront congress with the true scope of social securitys financing challenges our amendment would have made a modest step in advancing the discussion about the challenges facing social security among policymakers and the public last november the social security advisory board technical panel released a report outlining a variety of recommendations about how we measure the problems facing the social security trust fund how we talk about those problems and criteria for evaluating reform proposals our amendment would have taken the good work of the technical panel to encourage a more honest and accurate discussion of the challenges facing social security the technical panel report suggested that the challenges facing social security may be even greater than reported while there has been a lot of discussion about the possibility that a stronger economy will reduce the shortfalls facing social security the technical panel warned us that the projected shortfall could increase as life expectancy increases faster than expected the panel also made a variety of useful recommendations about additional information that should be included in the trustees report regarding the size of the unfunded liability and other information illustrating the nature of the problem in greater detail this type of information would improve the quality of the social security debate tremendously because the facts of the debate would be more clearly established and stated finally the panel made several recommendations for the evaluation of social security reform proposals in particular the panel suggested that we should look beyond simply determining whether or not a plan restores trust fund solvency and consider other criteria that are as important as if not more important than restoring solvency over the 75year period such as the effect on the rest of the budget unfortunately today we do nothave time to discuss any of these issues i would respectfully encourage the chairman of the committee on ways and means and the subcommittee on social security to conduct hearings on these recommendations so that they may receive the attention they deserve i also hope the social security trustees seriously consider all of the recommendations of the technical panel further reserving the right to object i yield to my colleague the gentleman from arizona with whom i have worked closely on strengthening the future of social security a member who has been a leading advocate of comprehensive social security reform legislation that repeals the earnings limit and ensures that social security will be strong for our children and grandchildren"],

rise in support of the childrens health act and would like to alert my colleagues to two issues which specifically are addressed in this bill and which are of concern to me and interest to me duchenne muscular dystrophy and day care safety duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and most catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease occurring in one of every 3 500 live births and generally killing its victims in their late teens or early twenties my first experience with a family suffering from this devastating disease was in 1998 when my constituents roy and carol henderson from memphis first contacted my office their son had been diagnosed with duchenne muscular dystrophy i remember the pain and frustration that that strong family expressed to me as they began to search for answers to the difficult questions of why their child was afflicted with this awful debilitating disease why were there so few treatment options for their son and most importantly why had the government failed to prioritize more federal resources toward finding a cure to this terrible disease despite the 1987 discovery of the dystrophin gene the survivability of this childhood disease has not been extended in any significant way for decades the only treatment known to somewhat alter the course of this disease was the use of steroids whose serious side effects are well known for these reasons it is imperative that the national institutes of health nih begin to focus some of its federal resources toward muscular dystrophy research today we will be voting on comprehensive childrens health legislation which directs nih to provide a more coordinated emphasis on muscular dystrophy research and assigns the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke with the responsibility of leading nihs efforts in this promising field the bill also includes legislation authored by senator bill frist and introduced in the house by myself and the gentlewoman from newyork this section will provide the states with over 200 million to improve the safety of its day care centers throughout the united states the bill would allow states the flexibility to use the funding for a number of purposes including training child care providers rehabilitating child care facilities improving the safety of transporting children and conducting criminal background checks for child care providers with the all too frequent reports of abuse and neglect in child care facilities there was a need to give states additional resources to provide quality child care under the bills formula my state tennessee would receive 4 2 million to give child care providers the tools needed to offer safe affordable quality child care to the children of tennessee in conclusion too many of our children needlessly suffer and even die from abuse birth defects and diseases which can be prevented given the proper investment of our time and resources with the passage of this bill congress will renew its commitment to americas children i am pleased that the sponsors of this legislation recognized the seriousness of these issues by including them in this legislation i encourage my colleagues to support its passage"]]}
