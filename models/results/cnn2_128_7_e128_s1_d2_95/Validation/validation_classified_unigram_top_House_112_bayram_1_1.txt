americans the unemployment rate is 13 6 percent and its 10 5 percent for latinos the rate of unemployment for our youth is even more alarming with over 23 percent of 1619 year olds looking for a job without a job how can we expect our youth the future of this country to develop the skills and experience they need to succeed and live out their american dream encouragingly president obama understands that we cannot speed up economic recovery without investments that create jobs i was pleased to see in his 2013 budget proposal critical investments to create good jobs and job training programs for communities hardest hit by our struggling economy by targeting economic assistance where its most needed the presidents proposed budget goes a long way to level the playing field to give every american the opportunity to succeed theres a lot that my republican colleagues can learn from the presidents budget especially this that fighting poverty and reducing the deficit can be achieved together but let me be clear this budget is not perfect there are cuts in this budget that would undermine some of the progress our economy is making cuts to safety net programs like the community services block grant low income heating assistance and affordable housing programs will hit already struggling families especially hard during these difficult times we really do need to protect programs that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable we need to increase funding for programs like snap and wic which keep millions of american families out of poverty but keeping people from suffering the worst effects of poverty is not enough to restore our economy even with the recent increases we have seen in job creation longterm unemployment remains at record levels with 5 5 million workers who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more until republican leaders in the house can pass president obamas american jobs act or put forth any kind of reasonable plan for job creation we must ensure that the safety net is strong so again i call for an immediate upordown vote on congressman bobby scotts and my bill h r 589 which will give the millions of job seekers who continue to struggle to find a job just 14 more weeks of vital unemployment benefits this would allow them to have just a little more time to find a good job and to support their family while our fragile economy continues to recover also this congress has a lot of work to do we are just a few days away from when unemployment benefits are set to expire for millions of americans across the country lowincome families were hardest hit during the recession and they cannot afford another year of a republican congress that fails to focus on jobs refuses to strengthen our middle class and tries to end the

global food crisis there were major food riots in nearly 40 countries in may 2008 my fellow cochair of the house hunger caucus congresswoman jo ann emerson and i were briefed by the gao about the lack of coordination and continuity in unitedstates food and development programs we started calling for a comprehensive approach to address global hunger and food insecurity now thanks in large part to the efforts and leadership of secretary of state hillary clinton and usaid director raj shah the unitedstates government responded to that call and over a 2year period of time initiated a comprehensive governmentwide approach to reduce global hunger and increase nutrition and food securitynot because it feels good not even because its the right and moral thing to do but because its in our national security and economic interest to make countries food secure more productive healthier and more stable this strategy is known as the global hunger and food security initiative it includes our bilateral programs and efforts with other governments and multilateral institutions to be successful everyone has to pitch in feed the future is the signature program of the unitedstates strategy it works with small farmers and governments to increase agricultural production and strengthen local and regional markets in order to reduce hunger and grow economies other key elements include the mcgoverndole food for education and child nutrition program that brings kids to school and keeps them there by making sure that they get at least one nutritious meal each day at school this program has proven to be especially effective in convincing families to send their daughters to school and finally there is our food for peace program which provides food to millions of women children and men caught in lifethreatening situations brought on by natural disasters war and internal conflict this program provides unitedstates grown commodities and locally purchased foods that literally keep people trying to survive in the worlds most dangerous situations alive i have never heard anyone say that they would like to see more hunger in the world that they would like to see children too weak from hunger to be able to learn or young girls forced to work long hours because they no longer are being fed at school but thats exactly what the budget cuts that passed the house 1 week ago would do the house cut 800 million out of the food aid budget and over 40 percent from the development assistance which is where feed the future is funded if these shortsighted and quite frankly callous cuts are allowed to stand we would literally be taking the food out of the mouths of over 2 million children we would be depriving over 18 million people the food that keeps them alive in haiti darfur afghanistan guatemala ethiopia kenya and elsewhere we would be turning our backs on countries where we made commitments to help boost the production of their own small farmers so they could finally free themselves of having to depend on unitedstates and international food aid to feed their own people enough enough this isnt a question of charity its an issue of national security of what happens when desperate people cant find or afford food and the anger that comes from people who see no future for their children except poverty and death i ask president obama to stand up for his programs and

8 years over a period of 10 years on the intelligence committee here in congress and having served previous to that on the foreign affairs committee and now serving on the committee for security and cooperation in europe i have had an opportunity to see firsthand in germany countless amounts of food stamped with usa on them and ive seen them in camps and i suffer with the people now in southern sudan my colleague donald payne and a former colleague harry johnston from west palm beach were together at a refugee camp in nemili and previous to that in mombasa kenya ive seen our food aid around the world reduce the kind of antiamerican extremism that often festers in these regions and manifests itself into conflicts that we wind up having to go and fight about so the reality is that food aid is actually critical to our national security and the spending that we do to preempt or prevent conflicts means the less money that we have to spend later fighting them were doing a disservice to our servicemen and women by cutting programs that reduce the risk of war while adding billions to programs that create evermore powerful methods to wage war at the same time we need to recognize that the increasing amounts we spend on the military means the less money we have here at home to address our pressing domestic concerns all of us heard the president of the united states last night speak to this issue that while it may appear and might readily be perceived as nation building that we are doing in some countries it is time for us as the president said to begin domestic building when i went to iraq a few years ago they showed us the remains of a water treatment plant we spent 14 million unitedstates dollars building that plant and just as soon as it was finished somebody came and blew it up i see us building water treatment plants in basra and in baghdad in kandahar and kabul but i dont see us building muchneeded water treatment plants in the cities of the glades that i representbelle glade pahokee and clewistonas well as others deerfield beach and miramar my hometown ive had requests for water treatment matters as well as riviera beach every year cities and counties in the congressional district that im privileged to serve come begging and asking for money to support infrastructure projects that no one is likely to blow up and yet we dont fund them i dont say that we shouldnt help the iraqi or the afghan people develop their country but i do say that we ought to be mindful that in our own country we have bridges collapsing dams breaking levies failing roads crumbling and water utilities leaking away we simply cannot justify to the american people our willingness to spend tens of billions of dollars in iraq and afghanistan while neglecting those same efforts here at home finally this measure contains several billion dollars in aid to pakistan as i have said before you cant readily say the word afghanistan without also saying the word pakistan to the extent that we are involved in afghanistan we also are involved in pakistan but we send billions of dollars to pakistan only to see large sums of that money being used against american interests funding the very same extremist groups that we are trying to eliminate a recent article in the new yorker magazine noted that the pakistani military submits expense claims every month to the united states embassy in islamabad no receipts are provided and none are even requested were sending money out the door into one of the most conflictridden regions of the world without so much as an understanding of where that money is going what exactly it is being used for who in pakistan is giving it to whom and why someone is receiving it we know that the pakistani military and intelligence community support some of the extremist groups that are engaged against united states interests and which have committed acts of terrorism against civilians so again i come around to the point that we spend absolutely too much money on military and defense matters that we do not give half the same attention to debating as we do about cutting nutrition support as is proposed for women infants and children or financial aid to college students when belle glade florida in the congressional district that i serve comes looking for less than 1 million to fix their infrastructure and provide jobs for their local residents the republican majority has a whole long list of reasons of why we cant afford it and yet before us today i see 5 billion for two submarines 2 billion for one destroyer and 6 billion for 32 fighter jets i maintain that our level of defense spending is on an unsustainable course and at a time when we are demanding that the american people do more with much much less we also have to make choices and set priorities when it comes to our nations military spending i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9999999739015664, 2.6098433636434493e-08, 1, "inquiry last night in the

training of other iraqi militants and countless assassinations in lebanon including most likely that of former prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 in 2006 hezbollahs unprovoked murder of three israeli soldiers caused a war during which hezbollah rocketed civilian targets in lebanon and used lebanese civilian as human shields over the past 2 years it has staged attacks from turkey to thailand today it has forces in syria fighting on behalf of assad and the murderous assad regime and helping to train assads thugs in addition this year hezbollah twice has been directly implicated in terrorism on european union territoryin bulgaria where a suicide bomber killed five israeli tourists and a bulgarian and in cyprus where an apparent hezbollah terrorist attack was thwarted the failure of most european nations to designate hezbollah has been based on the flimsiest of reasons namely that hezbollah provides social services to the shiite community and participates in electoral politics in lebanon in fact hezbollah takes a very novel approach to electoral politicsusing a militia to intimidate voters into voting for them by the way its a lesson that hamas has learned very very well but europes failure to designate hezbollah as a terrorist group is not merely a problem because it accords legitimacy to a terrorist organization rather it has important operational consequences as well the failure to designate makes it more difficult to prosecute cases against hezbollah crimes committed in europe it allows hezbollah to use eu territories to fundraise recruit new members propagandize and train and thus the freedom hezbollah enjoys in europe ultimately affects noneuropeans as well the european union obviously will make its own decisions on this matter but its hard to escape the

the patent system is the lack of resources available to the pto the average wait time for a patent approval is 3 years or more these are products and innovations that will create jobs and save lives inadequately funding the pto harms inventors and small businesses the bill allows the director to adjust the fee schedule with appropriate congressional oversight and prevents congress from spending agency funds on unrelated programs this will enable the pto to become more efficient and productive reducing the wait time for patent approval patent quality will improve on the front end which will reduce litigation on the back end the patent system envisioned by our founders focused on granting a patent to the first inventor who registered their invention this is similar to the firstinventorto file provision in h r 1249 this improvement makes our system similar to the international standard that other countries use only it is better we retain both a 1year grace period that protects universities and small inventors before they file as well as the create act which ensures collaborative research does not constitute prior art that defeats patentability there are some who think this bill hurts small businesses and independent inventors but they are wrong it ensures that independent inventors are able to compete with larger companies both here and abroad american inventors seeking protection here in the united states will have taken the first step toward protecting their patent rights around the world the bill also makes the small business ombudsman at the pto permanent that means that small businesses will always have a champion at the pto looking out for their interests and helping them as they secure patents for their inventions this bill protects small businesses and independent inventors by reducing fees for both this bill represents a fair compromise and creates a better patent system than exists today for inventors and innovative industries patents are important to the united states and the world for example during the war of 1812 american troops burned the canadian town of york known today as toronto in retaliation the british marched on washington in the summer of 1814 to put the capital city to the torch dr william thorton the superintendent of the patent office delivered an impassioned speech to the british officer commanding 150 redcoats who were tasked to burn blodgetts hotel where the patent office was located thorton argued that the patent models stored in the building were valuable to all mankind and could never be replaced he declared that anyone who destroyed them would be condemned by future generations as were the turks who burned the library in alexandria the british officer relented and blodgetts hotel was spared making it the only major public building in washington not burned that day american inventors have led the world in innovation and new technologies for centuries from benjamin franklin and thomas edison to the wright brothers and henry ford but if we want to foster future creativity we must do more to encourage todays inventors now is the time to act i urge the house to support the america invents act i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
