report i urge every member to read that because i do not think that members realize that buried in this socalled lobbying bill is a deliberate grassroots gag rule designed to kill precisely the pressure from back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington it has been the grassroots who have risen up the crowning blow to liberals was the grassroots opposition to the clinton health plan which stopped in its tracks an effort to create a big government big bureaucracy big tax health plan now what do we have we have in

members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the

we will debate today i think it is important to point out the important programs research and funding for which this legislation rovides indeed many of the programs funded under these departments are the daytoday lifeline programs so crucial to millions of americans foremost the lions share of funding contained in h r 2518 is designated spending for medicare and medicaid these are the dollars which support the federal share of the medicaid program and subsidize the medicare health services for our sick elderly while it is in fashion today to decry entitlement spending and slash medicare and medicaid spending for budget purposes we cannot lose sight of the essential purposes served by these programsfor beneficiaries this is often the only link they have to health care and medical services i do not mean to imply that these programs are unflawed nor that their growth need not be controlled but i stand firm in my commitment that health care policy and health care reform must be made on the issues of access and quality of health carenot a costbenefit exercise or balance sheet earlier this year i fiercely and vocally opposed the proposed cuts in medicare programs contained within reconciliation as i have long held we cannot try to tell our aging americans that all we have to do is ratchet down on waste fraud and abuse and cut the fees of those so called rich doctors and expensive hospitals and we will be able to cut costs and maintain quality health care that is just not so already the medicare program is losing its ability to attract and maintain the participation of quality providers furthermore it is painfully clear that shortfalls in medicare payments to hospitals and doctors will be costshifted and passed directly to every other insured american that means that over the next 2 years americans who have managed to hold on to health insurance will pick up 28 billion in medicare shortfalls to hospitals another 20 billion in underpayments to doctors and other providers will be costshifted to paying americans so as long as we as a nation do not turn the sick and injured away from our hospitalsso long as we are not leaving them to die in the streetsthe cost of caring for these patients will not go away only shifted to other insured patients this is exhibit a as to why we need to address the causes of our health care crisis not merely attach the symptoms todays legislatlon demonstrates our commitment to medicare and medicaid and funds more than 100 billion for these health care programs while we are not enacting changes in these statutes it is timely to once more remindmy colleagues that we cannot use these programs as sources for draconian budget cuts without question we need health care reform but not one which balances the budget on our most frail members of societythe sick elderly i am also pleased to see record levels of funding the national institutes of health including 2 1 billion for the national cancer institute these dollars will allow continued prevention research vaccine development treatment study and clinical experimentation toward eradicating this scourge the committee has reemphasized its support of ncis focus on breast cancer and prostate cancer research and rightly so more than 46 000 women die of breast cancer every year and one in eight women will suffer breast cancer in her lifetime this plague has hit especially hard in the northeast region of the united states and my own state of new jersey and i fully support efforts of nci to find the reasons and causesnd ultimately the curefor this terror at the same time more than 35 000 men will die of prostate cancer with more than 165 000 new cases diagnosed in 1993 i commend the recommendation of the committee that nci make prostate cancer another top priority in its research and mission the national institute of mental health also deserves recognition today i am confident nimh will make good use of the 613 million funded in fiscal year 1994 for its research and research training on mental disorders treatments and services and i laud the institutes efforts to educate federal local and state organizations as to the importance of mental health and the destigmatization of mental illness nimhs research continues to show us that mental illness is a real and physical one not some character flaw or personality demon that we cannot work to help or treat but a tangible physical health problem as real as diabetes cancer or a broken leg the work of nimh allows us so move past the dark ages of health care and move past the snake pit

care insurance benefits and coverage for persons with mental illness nimhs pioneering research in this field has made clear what so many of us have known all along and sets the stage for future good work finally congress today is taking steps to make good on its promise in the ryan white care act to provide funding aids patients care intervention efforts and most notably emergency assistance to cities the committee has provided 318 million in emergency funding for especially hardhit cities and metropol tan areas and make no mistake my colipagues evry one of those dollars are especially needed the aids epidemic continues to grow and our public hospitals and health care resources are falling under this burden our emergency rooms in inner city hospitals are mash units today and the situation is worsening the lack of health services poverty and social dysfunction compounds this crisis as the cost of each aids patient reaches 100 000 over their lifetime the ryan white dollars cannot alleviate these problems or hope to pay every cost but our neglect can only further speed the collapse of our public health care system today aids is no longer a disease affecting the margins

would have to add to that if all politicians were like b t collins we would probably not have a need for political parties because b t represented the best of human beings but also the best of

jobs and restore fairness to our tax system for the 11 years that i have been a member of this body i have been frustrated by the previous administrations policies of tax cuts for the wealthy increased taxes on middle and lower incomes and decreased public investment these policies have left a legacy of staggering federal deficits a national debt of over 4 trillion a huge growth irv the disparities of wealth and an economy struggling to recover from recession obviously these policies have failed this country miserably it is time to hange the course fortunately today we have a president with the courage and vision to turn these policies around for the first time in my career we have a credible deficit reduction plan that asks those who benefited most from the past policies to pay their fair share protects middle and lower income people and provides incentives for small businesses and investment that will help grow this economy and create over 8 million jobs over the next 5 years h r 2264 will cut the deficit by nearly 500 billion over the next 5 years more than half of this deficit reduction is achieved through real and specific spending cuts including cuts in agricultural programs administrative costs and entitlements while i would definitely not like to raise taxes at all i have looked at all other alternatives and there is absolutely no other way to get the deficit under control this plan does raise taxes however it does so in a way that is fair and equitable the overwhelming majority of taxes fall on those who benefited most from the tax breaks of the 1980s eighty percent of the taxes fall on those making over 200 000 a year families making under 140 000 a year will not pay one penny more in income taxes the only tax that will affect middle income americans is a modest 4 3 cent gas tax i believe that the gas tax which will cost most americans only 3 00 a month is a small price to paj for ensuring our future economic growth and vitality through the expansion of the earned income tax credit families making under 25 000 will actually receive a tax break in addition this strong antiwelfare measure will give low income people incentives to work and pull themselves out of poverty h r 2264 provides incentives and investment to get this economy growing the financial markets recognizing the credibility of this deficit reduction plan have already responded favorably and interest rates have dropped because of lower interest payments businesses and individuals now have more money to save and invest for their future in addition under this plan 90 percent of small businesses will be eligible for tax credits for their investments helping businesses grow will create millions of jobs for americans the bill also invests in children through head start and childhood immunization and expands worker training and education so that american workers have the skills they need to get highskill highwage jobs opponents of this plan claim that there are too many tax increases and not enough spending cuts however their alternatives would replace the tax increases on upper income americans with deep cuts in social security medicare and other entitlements their proposals place an unfair burden on the backs of seniors and working people i have heard from many constituents who were concerned that middle income seniors would be hurt by the increased tax on social security benefits while i would prefer that this plan included no tax increase on social security recipients let me emphasize that anyone whose adjusted gross income is less than 34 000 for individuals or 44 000 for couples will not pay any new taxes on their social security we must pass this plan now this is the only deficit reuction package before us the altemative is

represents a historic change for the country and el paso congress voted to reverse 12 years of squeeze the middle class policies of the reaganbush years certainly there are plenty of critics who pan the clinton administration deficit reduction plan as having done too much or not enough in comparison to what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and the national debt and just under 1 billion when george bush moved out of the white house the deficit was racing paid 300 billion and the national debt stood at just over 4 trillion the test of the clinton deficit plan should not be perfection rather is should be does this plan offer a change of direction from failed trickledown economics that brought us shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the recldess results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which this party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented campaign of misinformation falsely alleging the middle class would get soaked and that small business would be robbed by the clinton plan now the facts not a single family with a gross adjusted income under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i respect that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period working class families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middle class families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directly to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business el paso alone living in poverty despite both parents fulltime jobs will receive 86 million in assistance to lift them out of poverty and reward their economic contribution more than oneinthree of every family in el paso will see

very hard on this the fact is that the republicans in this body have been and are a responsible minority our opposition to the clinton budget was a principled opposition and our support for nafta is a principled support the term national interest is something that we all try to locate and define especially when we talk about foreign policy but national interest is very important in international trade it seems to me our national interest is served by removing trade barriers by lowering tariffs which is another way of saying cutting taxes when you cut taxes you increase exports and when you increase exports you increase the jobs you get more jobs for 50 years we have had an economic growth that has been fueled by liberalizing international trade this growth has given us a standard of living that is the envy of the world we need a world trade policy that is centrifugal not a centripetal view nafta is only one incremental step in encouraging worldwide economic growth and it demonstrates american leadership in the quest for global prosperity the question is often asked is the north american freetrade agreement truly a treat to the sovereignty of the united states will this trade agreement allow foreign countries and internatonal tribunals to run roughshod over our laws and our federal state and local governments despite the predictions of the trade pacts wary if not imaginative opponents nafta will not preempt the will of the american people and lead to our subjugation by sinister forces nafta is a trade accord between the united states canada and mexico that reduces or eliminates tariffs and other trade barriers between the three countries over a 15year period negotiated by the bush administration the accord strengthens our country in many ways it removes obstacles to free trade and gains broad access to new markets for american products it will accelerate economic growth in all three countries and create jobs in its wake increasing the size of mexicos economy will also serve as a major disincentive to illegal immigration more mexicans will stay at home creating a larger market for american goods and services in short it is a winwin situation the side agreements to nafta negotiated by the clinton administrationwhile adding littie of value to the accorddo not give supranational powers to the commissions and eecretariats created for labor and environmental issues the united states retains all legislative judicial and administrative authority for writing amending and enforcing our laws expllcitiy stated in the side agreements is the recognition that each country will continue to determine its own level of environmental protection and labor standards nonetheless these appendages to nafta have some unappealing features if requested by two member countries working panels of the commissions are empowered to investigate complaints of persistent failure to enforce national laws regarding environmental protection occupational safety and health and child labor or minimum wage violations if the complaints are valid fines can be issued against national governments if they go unpaid tariffs limited to prenafta levels can be reimposed against the specific industry sector involved however in no event will a country suffer a worse penalty than the tariffs that exist today annoying as they are the flawed side agreements do not alter the basic nature of nafta and certainly do not negate the benefits it promises to bring nafta is a good example of why we fought so hard to win the cold war democracy and free enterprise are inextricably bound together with the defeat of international communism and the notable failure of centrally controlled economies it is essential to our national interst that free market principles fill the vacuum left behind by example nafta boosts free market forces throughout the hemisphere and beyond it offers strong encouragement to the worlds remaining nonmarket economies to rid themselves of the straitjacket of government controls our goal should be to ultimately extend this freetrade zone from the article to the antarctic strengthening fragile democracies and fostering the expansion of free enterprise and lucrative throughout the hemisphere to reject nafta and thus slam the door in mexicos face is to alienate our nextdoor neighbor as well as our other friends in the hemisphere and may ultimately disadvantage unitedstates exporters as they compete with japan china and others for markets throughout latin america defeat of nafta would also sriously weaken the hand of political and economic reformers in mexico who have made great strides to modernize that country during president salinas tenure it could easily reverse that favorable trend sending mexicos economy into a tailspin and straining our historical friendly relationship with that country claims that nafta threatens the sovereignty of the united states are simply not credible it does not mimic the maastrlcht treaty as some have claimed europe has been on the declared path of political and economic integration for decades north america is on a very different path we do not seek to combins our political institutions with our neighbors or to create a common currency until it was contrived by naftas opponents here concams over sovereignty arose only north of our border where an entire psychological discipline is devoted to representing pervasive fears of being swallowed whole by the united states looking southward anxiety over mexican designs on american sovereignty has not been evident since 1848 when our forebears handily defeated santa anna and acquired from mexico everything from texas west to the pacific coast americans have been advocating free trade for centuries as thomas paine

rely madam chairman i was quite disturbed at the tone taken by opponents of this legislation when it was last discussed on this floor this legislation does not threaten anyones property rights and to

scientific data necessary for sound public and private policy another untenable argument raised against h r 1845 is that more information will inevitably lead to more regulation there is no reason to assume that a better understanding of our biological resources will result in increased regulation data from the survey will generate information that will help us site development projects intelligently and allow them to proceed withu the environmental pitfalls they now face far from worldng against economic interests the survey can help us work for them the national biological survey

nixon and ford administratlons wrote an oped piece for the washington post mr sawhill dispels some of the misleading arguments offered by opponents to this leglslation for instance he notes that all current laws protecting property will remain in fore and the bill inciudes safeguards against unauthorized trespassafeguards that have been strengthened by amendments in the house mr sawhill also points out that h r 1845 will save money because we will be able to take appropriate and less expensive action in regard to ecosystem protection species will be identified before they become threatened or endangered and protection efforts require radical and expensive intervention by helping to determine what areas need to be included in a nature preserveas well as what doesnt need to be inclledwe can avoid costly errors in addition mr sawhills article shows how the survey can help us achieve both economic and environmental goals he cites the example of duke power which sought to build a power line acros the ecologically sensitive panthertown valley the company was able to draw on a detailed biological survey of the valley and by doing so duke located its power line in a way that did not disturb the areas rare species the project was completed promply and without the potential expensive litigation duke powers experience should alustrate to all of us how good environmental information can lead to both development and the protection of ecosystems i submit the full text of mr sawhils article ecolwoocal scar talk by john c sawhill sobered by the decadelong spotted owl controversy in the pacific northwest and determined to avoid such costly conflicts in the futurewhat interior secretary bruce babbitt calls national train wrecks the clinton administration wants to switch en dangered species conservation onto a different less controversial track unfortunately that has not stopped antienvironmental activists from gearing up to derail this new effort employing classic scare tactics these opponents are trying to paint the administrations plans as an assault on private property rights in fact this new direction in conservetion called the ecosystem approachthreatens no ones property rights to the contrary it makes eminent sense for business individuals and the country ecosystems are the support systems for species instead of waiting for a plant or animal species to reach the brink of extinction and then involving the endangered species act the new philosophy would encourage preventive measures across entire ecosystems to keep species from becoming endangered in the first place right now though our knowledge of the distribution location and health of our countrys native plants animals and ecosystems is incomplete at best to implement the ecosystem approach without a systematic national scientific inventory of those resources would be like setting off on a crosscountry journey without a road map there is a proposal in the works to create just such a map the national biological survey an ecological equivalent of the unitedstates geological survey would develop a comprehensive catalogue of the nations biological resources this is a proposal that deserves the support of americans interested not only in preserving our natural heritage but also in saving money in conservation as in all things good information drives good management decisions and generates costeffective results not coincidentally its the information that the national biological survey will generate that has the antienvironmental crowd so exercised surely they argue the survey will locate all kinds of new endangered species and thereby prohibit property owners from using their land in any way and to add insult to injury doubtless some zealous government biologist will trespass on private land to collect the information in the first place the hyperbolic tone of congressional testimony by the national inholders association typifies antienvironmental opposition to the survey the purpose of this legislation ts to curtail or eliminate human uses of natural resources and transfer privatelyowned resources into public hands without compensation the association blustered the will be no more than fuel for the existing engine that is precipitating the train wrecks nothing could be farther from the truth read the legislation establishing the national biological survey and youll find that all current laws protecting property owners will remain in force it also includes safeguards against unauthorized trespass moreover the better data provided by the survey will be just as likely to provide grounds for reducing regulations as for imposing new one in fact far from halting development biological survey data survey should generate information that will help us site development projects intelligently so that they can proceed more efficiently in focusing on the property rights issues the naysayers have tried to 4eflect attention from the many other position uses of information from the national biological survey on the scientific level for instance the survey will be an archive for information on the locations and populations of the plants animals and types of natural communities found in the united states this information will in turn enable scientists to monitor the status of various atrisk species allowing them to identify any rapid declines and take appropriate lowercost action before a particular species becomes endangered to a significant degree the platform for this inventory already exists in the network of 50 state natural heritage programs the scientists working in these programs have done extraordinary work in locating biodiversity hot spots and helping set protection priorities information from the national biological survey will also improve the design and management of parks and natural areas the sad case of the dusky seaside sparrow a small bird once native to florida but now extinct shows us that we can set aside land for an endangered species and still see it continue to decline and even go extinct by helping determine what needs to be included in a nature preserve as well as what doesntthe survey can help avoid these tragic and expensive errors perhaps most important though the survey could help close the growing schism between economic and environmental goals indeed information from the survey has enormous potential applications for the private sector four years ago for example duke power the north carolina utility wanted to build a power line across the ecologically sensitive panthertown valley this plan faced numerous obstacles not the least being the presence of several endangered species but by drawing on a detailed biological inventory of the

passed out of here has far more prison money than is even in there now that is why we are supporting the hunterbrewster bill"], [0.003014981746673584, 0.4969850182533264, 0, "i rise in support of the chairmans en bloc amendment which now includes the porterpenny seawolf submarine cost cap our amendment caps spending on the first two seawolf submarines at 4 673 billion this commonsense measure will establish a badly needed legally binding measure of fiscal accountability in the seawolf program the gentleman from minnesota and i appreciate the chairman and ranking members acceptance of it the cap established in this amendment limits spending to the level the navy says it needs to finish these vessels that level is over 330 million above what the vessels were supposed to cost i repeat the first two seawolves are 330 million over budget these enormous cost overruns have been driven by the design equipment production and other program problems which have marked the seawolf program since its start and have made it not famous but notorious new problems were discovered in the first two seawolves only weeks ago these costly problems are troublesome in and of themselves but are even more serious when considered in the context of our shrinking defense budget by passing the porterpenny cost cap we will send a clear message to the navy and other parties involved in the seawolf program we will say that regardless of additional problems there are limits that we will throw no more money into these overpriced submarines and the navy must get the job done and not siphon off any more resources from other higher priority military needs i thank the gentleman from california and the gentleman from south carolina for including the porterpenny seawolf cost cap in the en bloc amendment and urge its adoption"], [0.00413784384727478, 0.4958621561527252, 0, "i rise in support of the amendment of the gentleman from california i think it is a commonsense amendment like the amendment that he authored to allow our drug enforcement agencies and other law enforcement agencies to at least enter with vehicles the proposed wilderness areas that about the mexican border areas that we know will be used by drug smugglers if we do not allow entry by law enforcement people that is commonsense i think this amendment is commonsense it goes to the practical problem that we have right now of trying to fund existing programs fund existing infrastructure it goes across the array of american programs and institutions and we are trying to fund existing programs with existing dollars and it does not make a lot of sense to create a new drain on the federal treasury at a time when we are undercutting and under funding programs that we put in place especially with respect to the national park service over the last five or 10 years i want to ask my friend the gentleman from california a couple of questions how many thousand acres of authorized but unacquired lands do we have right now

somalia the fact that the house is today debating whether and with what constraints we will authorize the continued use of united states armed forces in somalia may take some americans by surprisetrue somalia is no longer on the front pages of the newspapers in fact the deployment of united states troops for a humanitarian mission in somalia began 6 months ago with the participation of the united nations i know most americans are relieved that we are now winding down our participation bringing most of those troops home as the operation is transferred to u n command but there remain the questions of how long any united states troops will stay in somalia what their mission will be and what limits will be placed on the cost and risks of any ongoing operation because this subject is so serious it would have been in the best interests of all americans for the debate to have come under an open rulewith the greatest opportunity for the broadest participation by the most members after all american lives are at stake although the chairman of the foreign affairs committee did not request an open rule i wish to commend him the ranking member and the rules committee for ensuring that those amendments brought forward to the committee will be allowed consideration my own view on this subject is that our job as originally defined in somalia is virtually complete and i oppose the 12month openended and blank check authorization of united states forces i certainly am deeply troubled by the expanded mission outlined in this measure i know many of my colleagues come to this debate with equally strong opinions and we are going to hear these as we should i urge my colleagues to join me in listening carefully to all the points of view presented during todays debate after all that is our purpose to air differing views and arrive at the best and mostinformed conclusion and that is the way open rules generally serve the process of deliberative democracy best after all that debate today is what our purpose is here as legislators and managers of oversight for the people we represent what could be more important than the lives of our men and women in the military i think that we are going to get differing views aired and i hope and i pray that we arrive at the best most informed conclusion as we complete our process that is why i think that open rules generally serve the deliberative democracy process best and while i do not object to this rule today i do not want to suggest that an open rule would not have been better"]]}
