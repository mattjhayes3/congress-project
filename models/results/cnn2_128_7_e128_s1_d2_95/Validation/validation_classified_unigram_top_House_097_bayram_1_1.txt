designation of the year 1982 as the bicentennial year of the american bald engle and the designation of june 20 1982 at national bald eagle day on june 20 1782 pursuant to an act of congress the american bald eagle became our nations symbol and national bird the bald eagle was chosen by the founding fathers because of its singleminded commitment to the protection of its young and the defense of its home the american experience of the past 200 years bears ample evidence that the spirit of the american bald eagle has surely infused itself into the american psyche we have looked to the american bald eagle as a symbol of strength courage determination and beauty and it is precisely these qualities that have come to denote the greatness of our nation it is indeed ironic and sad that the american bald eagle has been listed as an endangered species pursuant to the endangered species act of 1973 as our nation expanded westward from the original 13 states the clearing of the land and other forms of human encroachment drastically reduced the nesting and roosting habitat of the american bald eagle while scientists estimao that perhaps as many as 20 000 american bald eagles can be found in the state of alaska only 1 000 nesting pairs are believed to roam the skies of the lower 48 states fortunately this sad tale is being turned around thanks to the concerted efforts of federal state local and private agencies and organizations several federal government agencies including the fish and wildlife service the forest service the bureau of land management and the corps of engineers run american bald eagle conservation programs i am particularly proud of the new york state department of environmental conservations program the dec has just completed the first of two 5year bald eagle management programs the second plan already in progress calls for the release the 21 bald eagles from a single hacking site in 1981 and the release of 129 bald eagles through the end of 1985 i know that our colleagues can boast of similar success in their states and regions this public effort is being augmented by an aggressive private campaign several wildlife conservation organizations including the national wildlife federation and eagle vally environmentalists are engaged in ongoing advocacy education and action programs designed to heighten public awareness of the american bald eagles plight and encourage conservation activities i i can think of no better way for the congress to reaffirm our support for these necessary efforts then by designating the year 1982 as the bicentennial year of the american bald eagle and june 20 1982 as national bald eagle day the joint resolution i am introducing today calls upon people throughout the nation to observe such year and day and authorizes and requests that the president issue a proclamation to this end send a copy of the proclamation to the governors of the 50 states and to each member of congress and direct all federal agencies and departments which have activities which affect the bald eagle to cooperate and participate in the celebration of this year and day i urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this resolution i know that they will all agree that the american bald eagle is deserving of such recognition and support"], [0.021938681602478027, 0.978061318397522, 1, "i wish to thank the gentleman for yielding~to me and to commend him for his outstanding work and for providing for this special order so that we the delegates to the interparliamentary union might report to the congress and to the american people the results of that rather auspicious and important conference as you know the spring meeting of the interparliamentary union was held this year in lagos nigeria from april 12 through 17 i was honored to have been appointed as one of the delegates by our speaker i want to express my appreciation to my fellow delegates the honorable claude pepper who headed the house delegation and senator robert stratford who headed the general delegation i also express my appreciation to my other compatriots representative robert mcclory and representative caldwell butler representative mcclory is a senior member of the illinois congressional delegation and has been a stalwart moving force behind unitedstates participation in the interparliamentary union i also wish to express appreciation to certain esteemed public servants like the honorable donald easum former ambassador to nigeria and the president of the africanamerican institute who was in strumental in giving me some tremenduusly excellent briefings also mrs clara ossinulu the nigerian representative of the africanamerican institute the honorable walter carrington director of the department of international affairs at howard university and former unitedstates ambassador to senegal to the honorable abudu yesufu eke ambassador to the united states from nigeria and last of all to our own ambassador thomas r pickering and his excellent staff at the unitedstates embassy in lagos nigeria one must be aware both of the significance of the interparliamentary union conference in lagos and also of the very close ties between this country and the federal republic of nigeria which used the american constitution as a blueprint for its own democratic government the honorable alhaji shehu shagarl president of the federal republic of nigeria and commanderinchief of its armed forces stated in his opening remarks to the ipu thatthe interparliamentary union has over the years succeeded in establishing for itself a good reputation as an institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and scientific research csir the cyber 750 is one of the most advanced computers made in the united states and can be used for advanced nuclear research to model nuclear explosions and for breaking sophisticated encripted codes csir is an agency of the south african gov ernment research operation which has broad responsibilities which overlap americas nuclear regulatory agency bureau of standards and national science foundation two unitedstates companiesedlow international and swucoacted as brokers in the sale of highly enriched uranium fuel for south africas koeburg nuclear reactors in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend world the post was the largest circulation daily in south africa and the countrys principal black newspaper the government has refused to allow bishop desmond tutu to travel outside of south africa by revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and relocated them hundreds of miles from their families in impoverished semiarid rural areas the government has stepped up its bannings and detentions of both white and black student leaders including the banning of alexander borraine the son of a progressive member of parliament the government has continued to establish bantustans and to

the waterways and ports to reimburse the federal government while other transporation modes receive substantial federal subsidies further i believe for purposes of recor illation it is inappropriate

freedom from nazioccupied hungary late in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his

show our support and concern for the brave people of the captive nations in their aspirations for freedom selfdetermination and basic human rights second we also have an opportunity to express our outrage and continuing our opposition to soviet expansion and soviet rule over so many people who would surely chose another system of government if they had the chance we have been making these speeches now for 22 years some people have suggested that these speeches are an exercise in futility we cannot roll back the iron curtain we are told just by making speeches on this house floor but the fact is that we are beginning to get results take a look at what has been happening in poland take a look at the achievements of the workers of poland through the solidarity union which has already been able to establish in poland arrangements and procedures that have not occurred in any other communist controlled state who would have believed a few years ago that they could hold a secret ballot election in a soviet satellite state who would have believed that thie position of the communist party boss in poland could ever be in jeopardy at a polish communist party congress as it is this very day these changes have come about because the spirit of freedom has never died in poland and because of the continuing close ties and deep interest with the united states what has happened in poland can also happen in other soviet states recently the house armed services committee visited two other iron curtain countries romania and hungary we were genuinely surprised to see the level of independence that also exists in these countriesnot like what is going on in poland to be sure but still not the stilted frozen framework that might be supposed for example romania has long exercised a very great deal of independence in her foreign policy she is not a member of the warsaw pact she does not permit soviet troops on her soil nor does she permit romania troops to be placed under the command of the officers of any other country moreover the government of romania seeks closer ties with the united states and seeks the benefit of modemn american technology for exa~mple just before our committee arrived in bucharest romania had signed an agreement with the general electric co to have ge in schenectady build two huge turbine generators for two new nuclear power stations in romania they did not turn to the soviet union they turned to schenectady because they wanted quality goods and exercised their independence in making that decision and indeed we hope that romania will continue to turn to america and to the general electric co for the 14 remaining nuclear plants that they intend to build through 1995 from romania we went to hungary and incidentally budapest was one of the most beautiful cities i have ever visited here too we found a great deal of interest on the part of hungarian government and communist party officials which impressed us very much the situation in hungary somewhat differed from what we found in romania hungary is a fullfledged member of the warsaw pact and soviet troops are stationed on hungarian soil hungarian troops maneuver with soviet troops and hungary in contrast to romania does follow the soviet foreign policy line very exactly however when it comes to the operation of hungarian economy they certainly do not follow the igid orthodox communist economic proredures of the soviet union in hungary they have a kind of social democratic type of economy based more on cooperatives than on rigid control from the top as far as we could see there seemed to be a remarkable degree of personal economic freedom which at least appeared to resemble capitalism in many respects and here again the hungarians seek help and close ties with the united states so based on what i have seen in some of these captive nations we do seem to be making progress because americans across our land are this week renewing their commitment to help the captive nations seek freedom of course not all of the captive nations are doing so wellukrainia the baltic countrieslatvia estonia and lithuania are still under very close

large part of the threat posed to the united states by the increasing power and contentiousness of the soviet union lies in the area of political and propaganda activity mass communication is used by the soviets to indoctrinate mislead and confuse peoples throughout the world the influence and strategic position of the united states are weakened in the process in addition 330 million persons are subjected to communist regimes in eastern europe and the unitedstatess r innocent victims of a rigid system of information control the totalitarian governments of these countries methodically seal off

representative latta because it reduces the fiscal year 1983 deficit below 100 billion and it contains a binding reconciliation date which will force the process towards a balanced budget in future years we believe that passage of a federal budget reducing the deficit below 100 billion in 1983 is a necessary step oward the real goal of interest rates declining to normal levels without this action government spending will continue to increase faster than peoples income and federal deficit borrowing will consume virtually the entire savings pool of the american people congress must write a budget that will regain control over the deficit and provide impetus necessary to restore the health of the many insensitive segments of the nation which have been devastated by unaffordable interest rates we are hopeful that this action will result in a decline in interest rates sufficient to generate economy recovery we are not happy with the high deficits in the out years forecast for the latta resolution let me interject that i am not either we have cut better than 80 billion out of the 1983 deficit and we are cutting more out of the future year deficits but we will have an

caving in to a forreign power and thereby subjugating unitedstates interests to israeli interests i am dismayed by the allegations that israel is acting the prima donna and is opposing the sale because of some sort of vainglorious conceit because these totally erroneous assumptions are being touted daily as absolute verities it might be well for us to pause and consider why one of our staunchest allis is opposed to the sale and why it is not in our national interest to erode the defensibility of a partner upon whom we can rely with almost absolute certainty the tragic events in egypt should forcefully bring home to us the fragility of the situation in the mideast and how very much worse our position would be without israel a rock of dependability and continuity in the midst of a shifting sea of political undercurrents and sudden storms what kind of threat do the awacs combined with the f15 package pose to the state of israel gen george keegan former chief of air force intelligence has characterized it as the most powerful offensive weapons systems ever developed for theater or regional air warfare simply put awacs have an offensive potential because they can be used to detect any possible movement by israeli planes should the arabs try to move enormous numbers of tanks across jordan and through the west bank to cut israel in half general keegan in testimony before the senate armed services committee and the house foreign operations subcommittee cited intelligence reports of meetings among saudi arabia syria and iraq to discuss the options which remained open after the failure of the 1973 war there was agreement that the assaults through the sinai had not worked and i quote there was only one tactical resource or option left that was to move 5 to 15 arab tank divisions through jordan at night in a onenight secret march and insert them through the west bank and then drive them through the smile narrows of israel to the mediterranean what is the military possibility of success again from general keegan any professional military officer who has been in the west bank 0 understands that two armored brigades could cut israel in two in one night and there is no defense against such a measure how could the awacs facilitate such a move the awacs would remain somewhere along the eastern jordanian border and because it is also a jet it can turn away at a range of 100 to 150 miales and evade almost any counterattacking force the israeli defense against a tank attack through the west bank relys heavily on lowflying fighter bombers general keegan summarizes the scenerlo well the significance here of the p15 is that it has a lookdown shootdown radar weapon capability that challenges even that of the awacs the f15s in a matter of 7 minutes from a forward base in saudi arabia can be over the west bank at altitudes of 40 000 to 50 000 feet where their extraordinary radar capability can spot the israeli fighterbombers with ease and from that position of great height advantage proceed to fire the aim 9l missiles to defeat the israeli counterattack to a country that depends ultimately on the superiority of their air force for survival being placed in that sort of jeopardy has to be awesomely frightening it is important to remember that twothird s of the israeli population and more than onehalf of its industry is squeezed into a small corridor that is never more than 8 to 10 miles wide think about it try to imagine what it would be like to live in such a country there is constant pressure fromi the outside world for the israelis to give up the west bank and to return to the 1949 ceasefire lines that would be like sitting in los angeles and having your potential enemy sitting in beverly hills or santa monica and the only place to retreat is the pacific ocean keep in mind that that potential enemy is backed by the massively equipped armies of half a dozen countries and supported by 15 other countries imagine

where another neighbor may have fled from persecution in arab lands where violent death is not some distant threat but where it is no exaggeration to say that every single 15erson has been touched by

accountability system in the bill not to mention a number of other defects that i have found in the bill unlike many on my sideand i want to assure those on the other sidei do believe there is a federal role in dealing with high unemployment particularly the problem of displaced workers who lose their jobs because of foreign trade and changes in consumers buying choices government policies and market responses i must say that the committee bill inadequately deals with these and other problems connected with the merchanization of work in modern times i commend the gentlewoman from illinois for trying to make a poor bill better the gentlewoman has improved the bill in several ways the funding mechanism eligibility standards the allocation of jobs among them however i disagree with the wage rate provision in the substitute bill i think that is a dangerous undermining of the prevailing wage rate system it can be condoned only because we are talking about shortterm 6 month employment both bills through are not very creative approaches to the problem of unemployment in the 1980s what we are seeing today is not simply an economic upheavel but something far deeper something that cannot be understood within the framework of conventional economics that is why increasingly mystified economists complain that the old rules do not work any longer we are seeing a general crisis in industrialism a crisis that transcends the tired old economic debate between parties and ideologies we see emerging a different economic and social order a postindustrial civilization that is increasing technological rather than industrial our federal jobs policies are quite pedestrian when measured to the highspeed world we now live in"], [0.00018912553787231445,

support of this concept they have been real champions for the rights of divorced spouses i would also like to commend the officers and members of the national military wives association for the excellent job they have done in presenting their case it is truly a worthy cause and i have deep sympathy for divorced spouses we heard in the hearings we did hold many sad stories and i am a sponsor of the bill that the gentleman from virginia drafted there are a lot of arguments in support for divorced spouses some have been mentioned and some have not they have frequently played a significant role in their husbands careers they have had to endure frequent moves i checked with the military to find out how frequent that was and it is as many as 10 to 12 moves in a 20year career they have had little opportunity to further their education they have little opportunity to hold jobs or to even get good jobs because of the transient nature of their lives then too they have often accepted lowpaying jobs because of that they could not provide continuity in their employment and often suffered poor career advancement for that reason but in addition to the poor work environment they spend many hours of deep concern about the welfare of their husbands especially husbands who are involved in combat they very frequently suffer poorer living conditions than spouses who are not married to military members they have had to pay higher rents they have had forced sales of furniture long periods of family separation and very frequently they have had to act as both parents when their husbands were awayhad to be both father and mother to the children as they were growing up so i conclude that they deserve far better treatment than they have been receiving and i want to certainly help them receive more equitable treatment equity i feel is the theme of this bill but not just equity for divorced spouses even though the scales have been balanced unfairly on one side for many many years i do not feel we should unbalance them on the other side in an attempt to remedy this situation i think we must also provide equity for the members of the service what we want is the best most equitable bill for both parties i agree with the gentleman from alabama the chairman of our subcommittee that we probably are acting prematurely as the chairman has stated we have not held as many hearings as we would like although we have had an opportunity perhaps through the years to do so we have not received sufficient testimony i would hate to pass a bill that the congress will attempt to amend 29 times next year because we acted prematurely this year but i also appreciate the realities of the legislative situation it is late in the session the train is leaving the station the votes are here for this concept and there is no opportunity to postpone or to hold further hearings to improve the legislation s as chairman nichols stated he and i have done what we think is the next best thing tried to incorporate as many of the improvements that we fecl would have been addressed had we had more opportunity to put the bill in final form our amendment to the schroeder amendment as the chairman has stated would limit jurisdictions for divorce it would limit provisions of the bill to marriages of 10 years of more permit garnishment of nonpayment of property settlements terminate payments if spouse remarries before age 60 it also honors court orders prior to the mccarty decision it provides improved health care for spouses and finally it provides commissary and exchange provisions to divorced spouses i think these are good amendments we feel that this makes a good program that mrs schroeder has offered even better a more equitable program not only for the spouse but also for the service members and i would urge my colleagues support"], [0.0003656744956970215, 0.500365674495697, 0, "i rise to pay tribute to one of our colleagues who will not be with us in the next

off this balanced r d bill which addresses concerns that are expressed by both sides of the aisle the reagan administration for instance made very drastic cuts in the solar and in the conservation programs but this substitute adds much of that money back for example nearly 90 million is added to solar seventy million dollars is added to conservation the substitute also includes funding for the clinch river breeder reactor the administration requested 254 million but it has been reduced to 230 million which is adequate for continued development this package also includes funding for the geothermal demonstration at heber calif it includes funding for magnetohydrodynamics mhd which was zeroed by the administration this is a very brief summary of the winn substitute in the interest of time i would like to provide for the record a more detailed discussion in general i think this is a good substitute which not only complies with the reagan budget and the reagan economic package but it maintains the technical integrity of the most promising energy technologies i rise in support of the grammlatta substitute to this reconciliation bill i have supported and will continue to strongly support the presidents economic recovery program which includes this grammlatta substitute i am happy to be a coauthor of this substitute specifically the winn substitute for title xii in the reconciliation bill the winn substitute changes the doe authorization contained in title xii to bring the program more in line with the presidents request the winn substitute is actually below the budget requested by the reagan administration for the department of energy like the reagan request the winn substitute redirects the department of energy research and development programs into more longterm research and development activities these longterm activities will be specifically those that will not be undertaken by private industry and therefore are more appropriate as part of the government role in addition this winn substitute containts funding and continuation of the liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant the clinch river breeder reactor crbr i am deeply disturbed by the creative accounting which was done by our committee in this reconciliation process the baseline which was chosen resulted in the committee on science and technology appearing to have come 1 8 billion under their as signed levels when in fact the committee was almost 100 million over the budget levels recommended by the reagan administration for all of the agencies which the science committee authorizes these false savings make a mockery of our hard work in trying to bring this federal budget back into line second i oppose title xii in the budget reconciliation package because of the fact that the strategic petroleum reserve is authorized at 3 8 billion this level of authorization is directly contrary to the assumptions made when the first concurrent budget resolution was passed at that time the decision was made to finance the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget both mr dingell and mr broyhill have proposed alternative ways of funding the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget and that issue should be resolved during the discussion on title vi even without the strategic petroleum reserve we feel that the winn substitute is preferable to the doe authorizations contained in title xii the winn substitute shifts funding into the solar and conservation r d programs at doe also a second geothermal demonstration plant for that promising resource is provided therefore providing a more balanced energy research and development budget than originally recommended by the administration the major difference between the two versions is that the jones substitute will provide for the termination of the clinch river breeder reactor project the decision to terminate the clinch river breeder reactor was make in committee by an effective twovote margin by contrast in the past the house has always opposed amendments to terminate crbr by margins of over 80 votes each time the crbr is essential to maintaining our countrys nuclear generating option in the next century without it we are left to rely on other more speculative generating options to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry in the next century we would also be departing from the energy path that the rest of the industrialized world is following for their future i want to reiterate that the administration strongly supports the continuation of the clinch river breeder rector project during our committees consideration of this budget the director of omb mr david stockman sent a letter to me in which he strongly endorsed the continuation of the crbr in that letter he said the commitment to such a goal is reinforced by this administration the reagan administration favors the economical and safe development of nuclear energy and in particular this administration supports construction and operation of the clinch river breeder reactor this administration intends to reinvigorate the effort on this project by joining the long struggle by the congress to complete

reasons first of all the small business administration is the better place in which to lodge this particular programfor the administration of the program itself the small business administration has some 120 field offices throughout the united states many more than the va has the sba is now set up to administer small business loans i would agree with the gentleman that in past years insufficient attention has been paid to vietnam veterans by thesmall business administration this resulted of course in the authorization of 25 million for small business loanis targeted specifically to vietnam veterans that passed this house overwhelmingly under suspension as i remember i would prefer and i think the program itself would be better administered by the sba let me repeat again because of the expertise it has in this area if this program were lodged with the veterans administration it would necessitate additional personnel it would also necessitate developing some expertise in the va to administer the program i think we have a solution to what the gentleman hopes to attain but it requires a little bit of finessing by this subcommittee and by the appropriations committee with respect to the 302 allocation of funds that are given to the 13 subcommittees this would be a program that would be better lodged under the jufisdiction of the commerce justice state and judiciary

a continuing resolution i think we can meet that problem though and we might include it in a continuing resolution another area in which we can pursue this is in conference hopefully if the other body puts the 25 million in the commercejustice bill we can get the house to agree that about covers the question the nub of the issue again is that this program would be better lodged with the sba if the
