there are some of us who feel strongly about defense contractors picking up their complete costs complete legal fees so i think it is quite an accommodation for us just to have this 75 cap i might point out that many of the attorneys that we have actually out in the legal system who are paid directly from local and county governments be it legal services or public defenders would probably love to get reimbursed at 75 an hour so it is more than adequate and as far as i am concerned rather generous that there is even a cap i might point out to my colleagues that what we have here is that we have two distinct legal systems if we have in our district businessmen or farmers who are cited for an environmental problem or who are cited administratively or civilly if they go through the process they have defense costs and they may have fines and penalties if they do they have to pay the entire cost anyone who has done criminal work and we have some members in the chamber who have done criminal defense and prosecution work they know that if an individual is indicted goes through the trial is acquitted or found guilty clearly under either circumstance but most importantly when they are acquitted they still absorb the entire cost of their defense however when we come to defense contractors we have a slightly different system we have got it so situated that if they are investigated for fraud and if they are indicted they can submit those costs associated with defense of those charges as an allowable overhead cost they are the ones that have been indicted and yet they cansubmit that cost as an allowable overhead cost that just simply means to interpret that that they do not pay for it the contractor does not pay for it my colleagues pay for it and our constituents and the american taxpayer pays for it so i think ie are dealing with a very offensive as far as i an concerned a very offensive and i think a rather expensive loophole the gentlewoman from california has been more than generous in offering a 75 cap and hopefully we can revisit this matter next year and let them do what the rest of the country does when litigation takes one to court be it civil administrative or criminal and you bear the burden of your own costs again i think it is consistent with the equal access in justice act something we want it to be i commend the

american people right now you know as a member of the sea power subcommittee of the committee on armed services i appreciate the devastating capability of soviet attack submarines the soviet union now bases foxtrotclass attack submarines in cuba if they base those same submarines in the two ports that they are building at corinto on the pacific side of nicaragua and el bluff on the atlantic side of nicaragua they will have a stranglehold over the panama canal now i was in the panama canal just a couple of days ago i went down and took a look at the lock system i went the entire length of the canal one cruise missile from a soviet attack submarine into the lock system of the panama canal will stop our traffic will destroy the lock system and will keep our boats our ships from traveling through the panama canal that is a major port of americas commerce now i have a lot of friends who have large farming areas i have a large farming area myself i know we have heard that it has been very difficult for farming communities in the midwest for example when they are undergoing tough economic times to understand why it is important to be concerned about that part of the world one reason they should be concerned is that about 50 percent of the exports the grain that is sold for export from their farming communities goes through that canal and now if it does not go through the canal i asked one of the people at the canal one of the executives i said what happens if you dont go through the canal he said then you have to go all the way around south america one affect that that has on our grain markets is that then perhaps it will go to different customers because our grain is going to be more expensive than it would be if it went through the canal the point is that everybody in america who makes a living and depends to some degree on export whether you are farmer manufacturer et cetera has an interest in the panama canal that is why the american people acted so fervently when jimmy carter gave away the panama canal they knew they knew even if they were not intellectualizing about it even if they did not have a complete intellectual or technical analysis of it they knew the panama canal was fundamental to our economic system and that is why they did not want it to go they probably were right because general noriega is tearing the country up in panama now we are going to have a very difficult time there but to go back to the gentlemans position the soviet military that is operating that is strategizing the policy for communist nicaragua realizes that when they complete the ports the naval bases at corinto and el bluff they will have a stranglehold over the panama canal in world war ii adolf hitler sunk more american tonnage at the panama canal right at the mouth of the canal than in the entire atlantic it is a very vulnerable area you know one thing that impressed me today about the liberals who stood up and were upset with colonel norths photo presentation i listened and i listened and i never heard one of them say the word russian they want to keep that out of the debate as if by keeping it out of the debate we can keep it from becoming a reality if we never mention the 600 million dollars worth of tanks and attack aircraft and bullets and guns that the soviets are stuffing into nicaragua it will all go away and in our own minds we can way well those are just simple peasant folks down there who want a little bit better life they are a socialist government a communist government but they are not going to bother us but i find it interesting that the democrats in this house absolutely are unable to deal with the idea that the soviet union is moving into nicaragua and if the gentleman has a second slide there i think that is even more important than the first one now this is marshal ogarkov on communism in latin america now this statement by marshal ogarkov is this and it was taken back from the grenadan defense minister in 1983 when grenada was communist the grenadan defense minister went for some of his training in some of his meetings to moscow and met withmarshal ogarkov then the head of all the soviet military forces he met with him and wrote about his meetings and came back and in the grenadan papers that we captured when we took grenada for freedom we captured 26 000 pounds of documents we found this one document from the grenadan communist defense minister who was talking about his visit with marshal ogarkov in moscow he said marshal ogarov said these words over two decades ago there was only cuba in latin america today there are nicaragua grenada and a serious battle is going on in el salvador now obviously that shows that the soviet union is very much involved and interested in what is happening in central america"], [0.49650079011917114, 0.49650079011917114, 0, "everybody agrees that the policy that we are talking about was wrong and unfair and i think everybody in this house agrees that there ought to be a formal apology and that is a part of this bill as well we have reviewed the history one speaker a proponent of the bill said he felt badly because there was a democrat president and a democrat congress and that maybe they were responsible in some way i do not feel that at all it was a national policy it was endorsed by most americans and for it as the successors we are all indicted on the other hand if we could magically transport this congress back to those days and under those circumstances my suspicion is that we would do about what that congress did in those days which was nothing i do not think we are any wiser than the congress that was seated at that time however i think it is important to note that none of us here at least as far as i know participated in government at that time even though i suspect we all would have let it happen without objecting to it i think part of what the bill tries to do is to admit our guilt and to apologize for it i think that is exactly what we should do today but i am a little bit disappointed with what the committee is asking us to do what a contorted way the committee gives us to show how guilty we feel or how embarrassed we are what a funny way they ask us to rub ashes on our heads they are saying that with our current budget situation that our children and grandchildren must pay for mistakes that were made two or three generations before they were born by accepting the debt which the 1 2 billion is going to incur the committee is asking us to purge ourselves of somebody elses guilt with another generations money just think of the enormity of that for a minute it is not anything that we did but because we feel guilty because we have these noble motivations to right some wrongs we are going to give away money indiscriminately without respect to the degree of suffering without respect to whether we take it from the poor and give it to the rich or whatever because we feel a little bit guilty we are going to put the hairshirt on somebody else and that somebody else is our children and our grandchildren and remember they did not make the decision and neither did we make the decisions this seems to me to be a perfectly typical congressional action whenever we feel badly we give away somebody elses money then suddenly we are made whole we are purged and we all feel wonderful well i do not think our constituents feel wonderful about that i do not think if you put this bill to referendum that you would get one objection to admitting guilt i think you would get nearly 100 percent objection to giving away money indiscriminately which the government does not have to people without respect to the degree of claim they have many members have said in no way can we compensate for what we did to these people i believe that is true and i believe in no way should we try to compensate should we try to pay blood money to cleanse this embarrassment or the guilt that we all feel i hate to be curmudgeonly on this subject i always hate to argue against somebody elses bill i find it is a role i am cast into frequently i hate to put my judgment ahead of the people who have studied these things for a long time but for better or for worse that is my job and that is all of our jobs i do not think i am going to feel one bit better after we have given away our grandchildrens money in this way than i do today i am still going to feel that we made a mistake i am still going to hope that we do not make that mistake again but i am not going to feel fulfilled or purged or cleansed at all it is 1 2 billion we do not have that in our budget that means that should we be lucky enough to get a grammrudman bill we will have to make up the 1 2 billion somewhere else maybe we will have to cut it from a grant to somebody who is poor so that we can pay this to a rich person i believe this is an act of phonyness and i believe the amendment should be supported the

agency that promotes growth in the neediest areas of the world fosters the role of the private sector in these nations assists unitedstates business and promotes us exportsall at no cost to the taxpayer this bill does all of that opic was created in the 1960s as an outgrowth of the marshall plan which so effectively enhanced the role of the private sector in rebuilding europe following world war ii the concept underlying opic was to extend a marshall planlike program to the third world through the provision of political risk insurance investment guaranties direct loans and investment promotion programs for unitedstates firms in targeted developing countries opics primary mission is to provide political risk insurance against currency inconvertibility revolution and insurrection it also provides loan guaranties feasibility study assistance and with this bill equity investments in projects in subsaharan africa and the caribbean these programs are available only to american investments in new projects located in a developing country in which opic operates opic is an unusual agency of the unitedstates government in that it does not require an appropriationonly a congressional authorization to operate it began with 108 million in public funds which have long since been returned to the unitedstates treasury it is a selfsustaining operation and in fact has returned moneys to the government on occasion opic programs by removing much of the political uncertainty surrounding projects in the developing world allow the private sector to be the vehicle for development an indirect benefit of u s companies undertaking projects in developing countries is that such projects often help develop the host countrys private sector during the past several decades developing country governments have often practiced statism or government rectorship of the economy and government participation in the economy through parastatal enterprises these policies have proven to be ineffective models for development because opic insures unitedstates investments abroad there has been some concern that it underwrites the export of jobs from unitedstates soil at congress direction opic contracted an investigation of the trade and employment effects of its programs arthur young the contractor found that opic is a net creator of jobs in the united states it generated almost 18 000 person years in 1983 28 000 in 1984 and 17 000 in 1985 opic estimates that in fiscal year 1987 it created 15 000 jobs in host countries and generated 1 7 billion in unitedstates exports it believes that 1987 programs will generate 13 500 person years of unitedstates employment and 2 billion in exports many of these projects are being undertaken by small to mediumsized unitedstates companies the legislation before the house today extends and builds upon opics previous authorizations although there are no major departures from previous legislation the bill includes a potentially significant new program as mentioned by chairman bonker it provides a 5year pilot project for equity investments in subsaharan africa and the caribbean basinareas particularly economically distressed opic will be allowed to own up to 30 percent of a project once up and running opic will sell its equity share with the debt crisis many sources of international lending have dried up often an equity investment by a bilateral or multilateral lending organization is necessary to attract other investors to a project small businesses in particular often have difficulty in acquiring financial backing this pilot project will allow important projects in priority areas to go forward other developed countries have organizations similar to opic in the case of japan it is the export insurance division eid in the ministry of international trade and development last year the eid had a portfolio of outstanding insured investment of 7 4 billion in contrast opic had a portfolio of 4 7 billion neither eid nor many of its european coun erparts are selfsustaining perhaps as a result their insurance rates are lower almost all make equity investments the concept of political risk insurance and loan guaranties for projects in the developing world has proved so useful that world bank members have established the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga which will provide programs similar to opics to investments in developing vations miga is expected to be in operation by the fall migas programs will be available to firms from all member countries it

government of any other nation upon a program of interfering with private enterprise this country was not built by people who left their castles and got in their clipper ships and came to america to

about the refugee camps i just wish that i could recreate one scene a camp where there were thousands and thousandswe are now talking about in el salvadorof displaced persons mostly children and women but the predominance is children oh they were excited because there were four members of congress that went to this very outlying area and i was playing with the children and somebody said you must come and see our clinic we did not have a great deal of time and did not know where the clinic was and they kept insisting that i see the clinic and i found that indeed it was not very far from them it was maybe a couple hundred feet i walked to the clinic and i saw what we might call a pigeon coopequivalent to what we would know as a pigeon coop or a coop that we might use for animals in our country it was a very meager small building three little rooms in one room they had but a refrigerator and they opened it to show me the insides and they had tylenol in there some bandages the second room contained but a closet with some very meager medical suppliesthey really had nothing but they were so proud of their clinic this was their medicine we were struck by the plight of the children and it is unique to el salvador certainly but we saw it in el salvador we went to the hospital in san salvador santa tecla hospital where we saw hospital conditions that we would not see in this country we saw blood in the corridors on the floor and we saw a hospital with people that had a lot of heart wanting to help but very little in the way of medical people medicine and certainly they did not have the ability to provide the prosthetic devices that are the purpose of this special order the incidence of civilians losing limbs is increasing increasing by very large numbers and we find many cases where the amputations that were performed were performed in a manner that well you might say were botched up they need further amputations in order to correct the conditions before some of

orthopedic surgeons or with some of the orthopedic hospitals that we have what we are doing the four of us that went on that trip is we are embarking on a program to contact the hospitals in our area indeed congressman wolf has one or two teams surgical teams surgeons and people that will together with others perform the operation and then fit the youngsters with prosthetic devices so they can go out into the world such as it is and be able to work at least and to go from place to place the knights of malta have done an extraordinary job in making medical supplies that our country corpora

experiences whenever there is a famine or a flood or a disaster earthquakes our country comes forward with great geneiosity we need here we need money yes but more than that what we are appealing to today is to the many men and women out there who are specialists who are surgeons who have the facilities to reach out and are willing to go down but for a limited period of time it can be for as

record or the national technical means we are not supposed to speak of and they followed the special order that i had on the night of february 3 which i called a postmortem i even used an oxymoron in that at the beginning i did not realize i had said freedom is murdered temporarily of course when you murder something it is permanent what i meant was i had not given up hope what i should have said is it appears freedom is murdered but it is not that is a temporary situation but here we go again tomorrow i have here a document i got from the national security council i have trusted the nsc under every democratic president we had i particularly admired it under zbigniew brzezinski i did not always agree with what president carters national security advisor said but i admired him in this

department killing an insurgent believed to be a courier among the documents recovered from the body of the insurgent was the document entitled strategic estimate according to this estimate during the time before the salvadoran elections and the next harvest the insurgency should make blows against vital points increase not only suburban action but urban action and generalize the war on highways in all parts of the countryin other words continue destroying the infrastructure the document actually uses a new acronym gpr which is believed to be the peoples revolutionary war and it says the gpr should fuse the political military struggle the document states that planning must be done in order to get the masses to break through legality and generate anarchy communism loves anarchy the document also assesses the insurgent view of united states policy toward central american and internal salvadoran political matters now even in an hours special order even tightening my stomach muscles and giving you all the energy i can to make you listen i cannot touch on all this so i will by unanimous consent submit it for the record later this is a 19page document in spanish taken off this dead insurgents body as cal thomas put in in one of his excellent columns in the washington times the other day it was called lesson from a corpse here are some of the things it says this is an exact translation during the next few months of the harvest and the electoral campaign a window of great political and military weakness of the army and the government will open our military plan during this time must be of an integral politicalmilitary character we must seek to give military operations a better political content and reach the capacity for destabilization in the rearguard of the enemythe enemy being of course being jos6 napole6n duarte the oneterm elected 5year president of el salvador who everybody around here pretends to love and hug so much i consider him a brave man especially in the capital and principal cities this communique goes on titled strategic estimate we need a wide strategy which combines all tactics and categories of effort we must combine the gt errilla actions of destruction with politicaleconomic destabilization by concentrating blows against vital points it goes on with an excellent analysis you would think this was written by lenin himself vladimir ilyich ulyanov lenin who died 2 or 3 months before his 54 birthday i am 54 and when i think about what that man did died january 21 1924 he was to be 54 years of age on april 22 of that year the way this lenin has influenced the history of mankind certainly the most limprotant man evil or good in a millennium of the most important influence on the course of history given the numbers of people who have died at the hands of communism far more than hitler was able to brutally murder in the 12 stinking years of his socalled thousand year reich the communist killing goes on in most of the continents of the world right at this moment listen to how well this is written as though lenin himself were guiding the pen the special forces must also operate in this way in accordance with their own characteristic including local forces clandestinity and semiclandestinity but all these forces must always maintain their bond with the masses and work toward converting the masses into the largest service and intelligence structure of our army we must understand clearly that our greatest strength lies in our level of accumulated forces and the social timebomb we can use the qpr to fuse the guerrilla military struggle with the struggle of the large numbers of masses so that the fusion with give rise to the general insurrection field comment gpr may be the peoples revolutionary war so hope springs eternal they tried to pull off this general insurrection within 10 days of president reagans inauguration back in january 1982 is that not amazing we have been trying to work this problem in central america for president reagn 7 years and almost 2 months and yet in world war ii starting from scratch with nothing barely getting the draft going we went from pearl harbor all the way to victory in europe in 3 years and 51 g months this has been double what it took to conquer hitler double what it took to wrap up japan by midaugust 1945 and we are still working this problem with my hero reagan still adhering to jimmy carters offthewall figure like the speed limit of 55 advisors in this beleaguered nation of el salvador he says the key factor with the masses is that we need to get to the point where the radical demonstrations turn into revolutionary and insurrectional actions there must be appropriate planning and lines of action which break through legality and generate a state of anarchy disobedience and social disorder and causes the masses and members to make the decision to forget about fear of death never before has there existed objective bases as strong and dynamic as those which exist now which give the opr an integral paramilitary character to advance in the widening and radicalization of the masses movement and the impositions of our con spiratorial policy in the fdp field comment other documents taken in this same capture show the expansion of fdp to be the democratic patriotic front these objective bases will present an opportunity of exceptional importance through all of 1988 and a good part of 1989 get the feeling here we are going to be voting on contra aid again and again and again in the second session of the 100th congress and in the 101st congress and thereafter until the cancer of communism is removed from managua then he goes on another couple paragraphs however the context of the document seems to imply that the third forces and possibly the other terms are references to garnering support from untraditional sources for example as the document states from within the united states it must be taken into account that other forces can do a lot to help us get to the moment most appropriate to achieve victory these include conspiratorial spaces and tendencies in the united states itself which have come about as result of the unitedstates central american policy i might add that includes slimy films out of hollywood like the one called salvador that they show in some of the communist camps throughout central

lieutenant commander says you mean these are people who work with the death squads in el salvador and honduras and the guy nods affirmatively so here we have without batting an eye two cia agents he calls them oliver and hardy they are thugs they crash and try to kill people all through the second half of the film it is accepted in hollywood that the cia of course ran the death squads in el salvador and is now setting up death squads in honduras unbelievable so these people understand these communists in central america they have a lot of friends in hollywood then it goes on after another three excellent paragraphs i do not have time to read them all it says our conspiratorial line is by its very nature bound to dialog and negotiated political solutions but the dialog is not the only form of conspiracy it goes on to say dialog is one form of the conspiratorial struggle but we must develop other informal methods that in the moment of opportunity of power can be more or less important than official methods in other words yoko ono lennon all we are saying is give dialog a chance then it goes on to say and we must remember that flexible discussion and proposals are needed to stimulate the conspiracy another couple of valuable paragraphs that i do not have time to read and it says for revolutionary states and in the area of socialization negotiation is an expression of victory to force the united states to negotiate shows that the united states administration is politically weak and cannot mobilize all its efforts and that its policies are internationally isolated i wonder if they learned any of this from vietnam imperialists during negotiations try to make concessions on weak points and try to preserve the other points the concrete expression of this in our case is that there is united states congressional bipartisan support for el salvador but in the case of nicaragua there are deep divisions in the con gress the unity of the united states congress in relation to aid to el salvador will only be broken through strategic advance of the revolutionary movement the time of the united states elections is the most propitious moment to favor this division they are dividing us to conquer us watch the debate on the house floor tomorrow follow it in the written record esquipulas iithat is the socalled arias plan named after the president of costa rica a oneterm 4year president by the way is a concrete expression of the negotiation aspect there is in esquipulas iisometimes referred to as guatemalas most commony now as the arias plan there is in esquipulas ii for imperialism and its strategy for lowintensity conflict finally that expression of ours is making it into the communist documentscongratulations maj andy messing you finally got that expression to be understood the communists always understood it there is in esquipulas ii for inperiallsm and its strategy for lowintensity conflict an aspect which is a mortal game the defeat of the contras would be a grave strategic defeat for the united states especially if we take into account the impact of failure in vietnam and the geopolitical position of central america there is a field comment by our intelligence analysists it is clear from the text that the writer is using contras to refer to the nicaraguan resistance in other words this poor field guy hates to use the name the communists in managua tacked on to the freedom fighters dick nicaraguan resistance however if i ever need this man i will tell him that henry hyde says call them contra tyrants right up there is the seal for virginia it says so always tyrants sic sempere tyranis so let us call them contra tyrants our young freedom fighters it says the failure of the contras this is the communists writing again and the acceptance of the nicaraguan revolution for the united states can be a total global strategic change it would also affect the unitedstates counterionsurgency policy and support to the salvadoran government and right you are mr communist scholar being curried by this young courier right you are if the contras are defeated in nicaragua driven into some bataan death march toward the rio coco river in the north and the san juan river in the south to be picked up by american medical teams so some of our majority colleagues here being humanitarians would pick them tip and bring them to the united states hopefully all of them to move to fort worth and get registered 5 years from now and vote in one of your elections up there let us see what it says continuing here in spite of the bipartisan unity in the case of el salvadorvery fragile only due to this liberal democrat notre dame graduate jose durateit would be very difficult to have to recognize defeat in nicaragua in a global view it would not be politically logical for the unitedstates to take its hands out of nicaragua and place them in el salvador in the form of more military aid do not bet on it for these reasons the esquipulas ii guatemala city arlas wright reagan plan is positive for the revolution the revolutionary forces can use esquipulas ii and mr arias i add thatto divide and break down the opposition the united states can give nothing and needs to beg for everything the popular sandinista revolution has established its rules and we have our own 18 points and 6 points the united states is weak in the interest of time i jump over the next excellent paragraph and it says el salvador is a strategic pilot model for the application of lowintensity conflict methodology for the united states not only because of the geopolitical factor but also because of the characteristics of the model el salvador is a place where the united states broke the classic model of traditional military dictatorship and developed dictatorships of a new type which the united states classifies as democratic processes in other words people going to the voting booth pulling a little curtain and voting in secret they call that a new form of imperialism i jump ahead the failure of the duarte modelotherwise known as democracywould have strategic implications one thing is a revolution which triumphs over a traditional dictatorship another thing would be the fall of a christian democratic government with a reform ethic in other words they are admitting that duartes government is a christian democratic government with a reform ethic and they want to make it fail because that is an advancement for what we used to call around here godlessgetting redundantatheistic communism i jump through some tremendous material here which will be in the record the longer the war continues the more favorable is the situation for the revolutionary forces that is vietnam french or american model the bourgeoisie does not have prospects for resolving the economic crises and the internal contradictions of the situation tend to deepen all this causes the imperialists to have less control and more instability and then we came to page 8 you have got to read this my fellow american citizens in its totality the united states has started to display fissures in unity yes sir right in this chamber diverse factors have created this fissure including tiredness of the length of the warbecause we are an impatient peoplethe destruction the impossibility of winning and the realization that the war is an integral phenomenon based on economic political and social difficulties break the back of the communist forces of terror as we did in the tet offensive and then a distinguished american walter cronkite says ive had it a few years later he says on the air i heard him say this with my own ears i am no longer going to call the enemy forces in vietnam communist forces red forces i am going to call them only the army of north vietnam was that not nice the complete capitulation of americas no 1 watched and no 1 trusted newsmaker now here is a little document

no 1040 now here is a paragaph and it is good reading there are a lot of dreams here it says in one paragaph on the front page that in afghanstan angola cambodia nicaragua our determined support for

he is an expert on central america listen to this if congress persists in abandoning the contras they will soon have to leave nicaragua or find themselves hunted down by the 140 000strong sandinista armed forces which have been supplied with more than 2 billion in sovietbloc weapons compared to about 200 million in unitedstates funds for the nicaraguan resistance by the way the armed forces in nicaragua are owned by the sandinista political party not by the nation of nicaragua that is a 10toi advantage and we wonder if our little force of 14 000 contras all of them inside nicaragua nowthere

enabling the house to proceed and allow the committee on rules to deliberate in order to in turn allow the house to continue in session that dbay sb in obedience to that request i did and l spoke about 10 minutes worth and by that time the rule wasreported in those 10 minutes i announced to the house that r wanted to develop two themes one the question and continuing issue very fundnental to the destiny of our country and to the neighbors who share the new world with us that is central america specifically and latin america in general though not exclusivery in reality restricted to those areas and secondly i wanted to continue the discussion that i had sustained over a period of time and in reality quite a bit of tiie and that is on the fiscal the monetary the financial the economic situations and issues confronting our country burgeoning up it9no november 5 1 987 co from the midst of our society and also from a world continuing in a process of contraction with the tremendous ability to instantaneously communicate throughout the world as well as to travel great distances in small numbers of hours facts which were not true after world war i were not true immediately after world war ii with the exception of the revolutionary technological explosion in those mat ters having to do with international financial transactions and which apparently have not given an opportunity for lawmakers not only in our country but throughout the world to catch up with it has been as i said last thursday disappointing to me since beginning the discussions on what was obvious to me at the time would be the coming crisis and issues but which at that time seemed remote and improbable i am speaking now of 25 years ago where i came to this body 26 years ago and i was assigned to the banking committee at that time known as the banking and currency committee now know as the committee on banking finance and urban affairsand i have remained on that committee through the yearsmostly because it is an area in which i felt quite a bit of interest dedicated effort going back to the time i initiated my career as a public elective office holder on the city council of the city of san antonio and then in the state senate of the state of texas where i had been appointed to serve as chairman of the banking committee of the state senate 0l 1310 there has always been political pressure obedient to other issues in my district defense issues that place a considerable amount of political pressure on me to serve on such committees as armed services but when i came here the seniority system was in its strong vigor and the texas delegation in particular was an inexorable follower of the seniority system and it would have been impossible to have gained admission to that committee even though the speaker at that time the honorable john mccormack had asked me if i would give permission for him to intervene i declined that invitation on the basis given my experience in the state senate and even on the council of the local legislative body that anything that is constrained or forced is not going to work and that the natural flow of things was always to be preferred i am glad of those choices even though in the intervening years i have been offered appointment to the ways and means committee the appropriations committee and the rules committee but i have maintained my membership on the banking committee because i feel that it gives a necessary locus of activity i learned in the state senate that it is not what committee you are assigned to any more than what seat you are assigned to but what you do and to what extent you develop expertise and ability not only longterm but shortterm ability on the issues so one of the first issues i addressed was in 1963 at that time we had a far more leisurely time as far as the processes were concerned in the congress seldom did we have rollcall votes seldom did we meet for active legislative exertion more than 2 days a week and the banking committee for the first time in 1963 met more than three times during that first session in 1962 my first year the committee met one time to give my colleagues an idea of the different pace and environment that has existed since then the reason that i knew i had made the right choice was that the then secretary of the treasury the great mr dillon douglas dillon who was considered an expertbut i soon found that experts sometimes need to be more carefully scrutinized than laymen came before us mr dillon appeared before us in the spring of 1963 to request that we approve a measure that would repeal the silver transactions tax it also coincided with the first year that chairman wright patman served as chairman and it was wright patman that inaugurated the 5minute rule chairman patman was the first chairman of a standing committee to allow every member of that committee to have a chance under the 5minute rule to ask a question or make a statement i took advantage of that to ask two questions of mr dillon first was it not true that the silver transactions tax had been a wartime tax to which he replied affirmatively and i said second was it not true that the reason it was passed by the congress was to prevent speculation in time of war particularly in this market known as the silver market to which he said he was not sure but he thought so i then had an opportunity to ask a followup question and that was this since at this time we are using silver in our currency what will be the impact of creating a volatile speculative market which is bound to be born or reborn if we abrogate the silver transactions tax to which he replied that it was necessary because of the heavy industrial use of silver in the postwar period but he did not answer the question and that was would it not ultimately impact on the treasurys ability to consider silver content in our coinage and he said not for the foreseeable future at the worst well i will sum up by saying that exactly 2 years later in the spring of 1965 the same secretary came with a measure that removed the silver content from our coinage system so that we had a rebirth of the speculative futures markets if you please then some 14 years later or 17 years later the renowned billionaires the hunt brothers of texasthat is h l huntdecided that they were going to pit their narrow texas wealthgathering abilities against the experts and these were mostly based on the fact that they and their predecessors had been in the right place in texas to own land that produced oil and they cashed in on that they had no other ability that i know of in business or entrepreneurship nevertheless they decided that they were smart enough to pit their brains against those old speculative markets in london france and zurich forgetting that the world had changed and that these are people who have had 400plus years experience in the most speculative but yet controlled markets of all the silver and the gold markets lo and behold at the same time and coincident with that effort we had the beginning of what now has turned out to be the takeovers the mergers the giant dinosaurs trying to eat the other dinosaurs but what the american people have never been clearly told is that all those processes were tying up the available credit resources or banking credit resources of the nation if you please in the case of the h l hunt brothersbunker and nelson or nelson bunker hunt i forget which way is goesthey were able to garner from 20 to 30 billion dollars worth of banking resources and credit that should have been available as the law prescribes in issuing charters to banks that is for public need and convenience everybody forgets about that this week and last week the distinguished and very able chairman of the full committee on banking the gentleman from rhode island mr st germaini called on the request of many of the members on us to have hearings on the present monetary problems we have gone into such things as even the recent stock market collapse we summoned forth the executive secretary or manager or director of the securities and exchange commission and we had a private meeting to hear all those afterthefact lamentations and wailings and moanings but some of us had predicted this because the handwriting on the wall was plain and significant going all the way back to the 1960s even to the last year of president kennedys regime when the trade balance began to suffer deficits deficits compared to 150 to 160 billion annual deficits that we suffer today this bloodletting was the beginning of the bloodletting of our lifes blood of course 10 billion in that day and time was relatively manageable and indeed the president had the sagacity to have working in the department of the treasury such men as robert roosa of new york who then devised the socalled roosa dollar or the twotiered gold proposal which kept things together until 1971 at which time president nixon with my fellow texan the sec retary of the treasury john connally devalued the dollar in august 1971 by 10 percent yet there was not on newspaper there was not one journal that ever called it a devaluation at all it was just like in prior years nobody was taking note of the fact that we were having a repetition of what happened after world war i when germany overcome by the might of the allies prostrated was compelled to pay reparations when everybody with any common sense knew at the time that would be impossible to meet so they were very ably seeking ways to get over that and they finally did the united states was the only creditor nation in world war i the united states was the only creditor nation in world war ii as of 3 years now the united states is a debtor nation the biggest debtridden nation in the whole world with a greater debt than all of the socalled third world or developing nations who are perishing under the burden of their debt and their inability to pay it so some of us dared to question the situation in june 1966 when we had this socalled credit crunch occasioned by the fact that overnight on june 19 1966 the principal banks headquartered in new york overnight in one fell swoop raised the prime interest rate by 1 whole percent that had never happened before even during the civil war this was before we had what we know as our national banking system which incidentally was born in 1865 that was under the national currency act of 1865 right about the time president lincoln was assassinated and he had this problem uppermost in his mind the day he died so to sum up where we are today this is similarly clearly reflected although of course it is not the same as after world war i last week we had four preeminent economists the outstanding economists in our country and one of the younger ones who happens to be the economist for the biggest bond and stock house in new york said well you know we built an econometric model but of course we couldnt put into our model meaning they could not put it in the computer anything going back beyond two decades i could not believe it of course this mans youth clearly would indicate that he is not a depressionera kid as some of us are that whatever he knows comes through reading history and that he himself is admitting that they had not gone back into history far enough to factor what i reported to this house in a special order in august 1979 that all of the factors were once again coming back these are variable what they call in mathematics variable factors so the variables were now back in that equation that produced the bust in 1929 and i pointed out why among the factors as of that point in 1979 was the rule of thumb of the real international bankers the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland these are the boys that have survived wars financed wars and had all the warring and financial interests all together in one fold while our men were dying and german boys were dying and british boys were dying these bankers were there in basel switzerland making sure that they not only came out alive but came out richer than ever before and in fact they determined such things as the international monetary fund the imf that was born of the bretton woods conference after the war in 1944 and 1945 here in the united states it should not surprise the members that bretton woods collapsed when president nixon took us off the gold exchange and devalued the dollar by 10 percent and devalued it again in 1973 it was to no avail i had become chairman of the subcommittee on international finance trade and monetary policy and it was to no avail that i raised my voice and tried to protest that we should at least have hearings and consider the implications and the underlying causes and that the united states would have to again exert its remaining vestige of persuasive power to lead the nations into a more fixed stable arrangement rather than going into what they call the floating currencies floating means exactly that it means there is no stability and all through mankinds history at all times there are two truths first that you cannot charge usurious interest and legalize what otherwise has been illegal through the centuries without that society failing and all the history of interest rates shows the rise and the fall of empires including the spanish empire of the 15th century all you have to do is just track the interest rates how much those spanish kings with all the gold they had and everything had to pay the money lenders by way of interest to fund their wars the same thing is true today and i would like to place into the record an article in the new york times sunday october 25 in the foreign section entitled history lessons we failed to learn the last paragraph i am going to refer to says exactly what i have been saying that there are few schools of business in the united states that teach financial history how can we remember the lessons of history if we have not been taught them i submit a copy of the october 25 new york times article as follows from the new york times oct 25 1987j"], [0.5030245184898376,

leaving family behind endowed her with a tremendous spirit a spirit of sensitivity for the less fortunate a great spirit of resistance to any form of oppression to any form of totalitarianism but as sensitive as she was she never lost the strong will to fight those forces that would oppress people she felt deeply about people i remember visiting her district one time a housing project she introduced me to the leaders of that community as one of them as a person who cared about their well being in housing health care i shall never forget the unselfishness that she showed in my presentation to those people february 24 1987 she was strong as i said she felt that in the quest for world peace we had to stand strong she felt that we needed an effective arms control process if we

and ought to be noted that agriculture committee members who are under great pressure to kind of usually be supportive on these issues that it is members of the agriculture committee who are taking the lead and objecting to what is an overreach we worked out an agreement some time ago we had the whole herd buy out in which we used federal funds to reduce competition in the dairy industry so we could help get the price up the exchange for that was going to be some support price reductions as a result of the drought it is virtually unanimously agreed upon that the next reduction the 50centperhundredweight reduction will be foregone so no one is suggesting that the dairy farmers be ignored the question is whether we go beyond that and convert what would have been a 50cent ahundredweight reduction into an increase the facts simply do not justify that this is an effort in my judgment as i said to overreach it has negative budgetary implications and it singles out one group for extra aid that will generate requests to do the same one argument i want to deal with because people say when you do this you are going to cut your surplus foods for distribution in all of these programs i am in favor of helping the hungry i am in favor of helping those in need i wish some of my colleagues on the agriculture committee were in favor of helping the homeless and the hungry other than by simply subsidizing agriculture and getting the excess it is an inefficient way to do it we should make a decision yes we can afford so much resources to help those in need and allocate them in a sensible way to justify what would otherwise be an inefficient and unjustifiable subsidy system maybe it is and maybe it is not but to justify a subsidy system because a byproduct of it will be some surplus to distribute to the needy is a bad way to make public policy that is a way that will lead to excess subsidy and bad economics so what we ought to do is to make agricultural policy

the police officer often in good faith had information which he reasonably believed was probable cause for a warrant and which in retrospect some 8 10 15 or 20 years later some court decides was insufficient it does not serve the cause of justice it prevents the effective prosecution in cases of drug abuse and drug smuggling and i think we ought to adopt the lungren amendment it is high time
