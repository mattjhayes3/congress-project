facing a pension crisis over 34 million american workers currently rely on the benefits they receive from a defined benefit pension plan to make ends meet yet with the growing number of corporations cutting pension benefits or declaring bankruptcy people are increasingly concerned about their retirement security more and more american workers are facing the prospect of seeing their employers use our nations bankruptcy laws to back out of their pension promises and turning their obligations over to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc which only partially funds promised benefits unfortunately the bill before us today is a missed opportunity to provide american workers with real pension protection h r 2830 makes significant changes to the rules for defined benefit pension plans increases the premiums that companies pay into the pbgc and does nothing to prevent com panies from dumping their pension obligations on american taxpayers according to the chief investment officers of over sixty percent of our nations largest pension plans these likely will lead to cuts or terminations of existing plans according to the congressional budget office this legislation would add over 70 billion to the federal deficit and fails to improve the pbgcs financial condition by increasing the agencys financial shortfall by 2 5 billion rather than allowing an open debate on this important issue the majority leadership has chosen to close this bill from amendments or even allow consideration of a democratic substitute the miller cardin motion to recommit protects american pension benefits by making it harder for companies to declare bankruptcy and abandon workers pensions protects workers retirement security by providing employers with pension funding stability and gives the airlines the tools they need to shore up their employee pension plans this alternative would provide american workers with real pension protection rather than continued retirement insecurity

year they put the first ingredients into the mixing bowl in the form of a bill to cut more than 50 billion over five years from medicaid student loans and many other programs of great importance to millions of americans then with the original version of this bill they added a compound of a few good things tainted by such unwholesome provisions as the premature extension of preferential rates for dividends and capital gains the result was a fullbodied onetwo punch that might have been intoxicating to some but was sure to leave us all with a bad budgetary headache and stick future generations with paying the tab so when it originally came to the house floor i voted against it but held out some hope that a conference with the senate would result in a bill that deserved enactment unfortunately that did not occur and instead we have before us a conference report that perhaps is a little better than the housepassed bill but shares its basic flaws the centerpiece of the conference report like that of the housepassed bill is an extension of the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends even though those rates are not scheduled to change until 2008 this is not only unnecessary i think it is not good policyand neither is letting lapse better tax provisions such as the research and development tax credit the education tax deduction to help students go to college tax deoluctions for teachers classroom expenses and the deduction of state and local sales taxes all of these have been omitted from the conference report it is true that the conference report addresses the need to remove the threat of alternative minimum tax amt liability from millions of middleincome america families but it provides only a oneyear respite and worst of all enacting the conference report will result in adding at least another 70 billion onto the deficit while the longterm budget costs are masked by a change in the rules for individual retirement accounts that may increase revenue in the short term but will greatly worsen the longterm budget picture questionable at any time that kind of increase in the deficitmeaning an increase in the national debt s even worse now when america is at war and when president bush and the republican congress have taken us from paying off our debts to a projected deficit of 3 3 trillion over the last 5 years the federal government has had to borrow more than 1 trillionmuch of it from foreign governmentswhich is more than the total it borrowed over the preceding two centuries this is a sorry record and this conference report will make it worse so count me out i thought the original recipe was wrong i did not vote for the original house bill and i cannot vote for this conference report that doesnt mean i am opposed to tax relief thats why i voted for the motion to retommit which would have shielded middleincome families from the amt without adding to the deficit unfortunately the republican leadership insists on

it is irresponsible to cut taxes for the wealthy when the nation is at war and the national debt is over 8 trillion indeed i think it is unconscionable to be considering voting another tax cut to the wealthiest 0 3 percent of americans the joint committee on taxation estimates that this estate tax proposal will cost the federal government 602 billion plus an extra 160 billion when interest is accounted for only 0 5 percent of the richest families in america currently pay estate taxes moreover under current law in 2009 only 3 out of every 1 000 estates will pay a penny in estate taxesall couples with estates up to 7 million 99 7 percent will pass on their entire estates taxfree any compromise proposal which deviates from 2009 current lawsuch as h r 5638is therefore crafted entirely to benefit this tiny sliver of the richest estates american voters stand strongly against drastic estate tax legislation according to recent polling data nearly 60 percent of voters hold the initial unaided view that estate tax should be left as is or reformed and only 23 percent support repeal when asked about the estate tax in the context of other budget priorities voters rank repealing the estate tax as the last priority and 55 percent of voters oppose repeal this socalled compromise nearly as regressive and costly as a full repeal is no compromise at all passing even this compromise legislation would constitute one of the most regressive tax cuts in the history of the united states middle and lowerclass americans will be forced to shoulder the burden of radically decreasing the estate taxboth monetarily and through decreased public programs in order to cover the monetary gap the government will plunge further into debt which will limit its ability to address the social security solvency gap and reduce the money available for public programs it will also have to tap other tax sources like payroll taxes which will overwhelmingly hinder lowerincome families i urge my colleagues to uphold the core american values of fairness and belief in meritocracy by rejecting this tax cut if we really wish to help the most deserving american families we should raise the minimum wage from 5 15 to 7 25 over 3 years did you know that todays minimum wage of 5 15 today is the equivalent of only 4 23 in 1995 which is even lower than the 4 25 minimum wage level before the 199697 increase it is scandalous that a person can work fulltime 40 hours per week for 52 weeks earning the minimum wage would gross just 10 700 which is well below the poverty line a minimum wage increase would raise the wages of millions of workers an estimated 7 3 million workers 5 8 percent of the workforce would receive an increase in their hourly wage rate if the minimum wage was raised from 5 15 to 7 25 by june 2007 due to spillover effects the 8 2 milli6n workers 6 5 percent of the workforce earning up to 1 00 above the minimum would also be likely to benefit from an increase raising the minimum viage will benefit working families the earnings of minimum wage workers are crucial to their families wellbeing evidence from the 199697 minimum wage increase shows that the average minimum wage worker brings home more than half 54 percent of his or her familys weekly earnings an estimated 760 000 single mothers with children under 18 would benefit from a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 single mothers would benefit disproportionately from an increasesingle mothers are 10 4 percent of workers affected by an increase but they make up only 5 3 percent of the overall workforce approximately 1 8 million parents with children under 18 would benefit contrary to popular myths and urban legends adults make up the largest share of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase seventytwo percent of workers whose wages would be raised by a minimum wage increase to 7 25 by june 2007 are adults age 20 or older close to half 43 9 percent of workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase work full time and another third 34 5 percent work between 20 and 34 hours per week minimum wage increases benefit disadvantaged workers and women are the largest group of beneficiaries from a minimum wage increase 60 6 percent of workers who would benefit from an increase to 7 25 by 2007 are women an estimated 7 3 percent of working women would benefit directly from that increase in the minimum wage a disproportionate share of minorities would benefit from a minimum wage increase african americans represent 11 1 percent of the total workforce but are 15 3 percent of workers affected by an increase similarly 13 4 percent of the total workforce is hispanic but hispanics are 19 7 percent of workers affected by an increase the benefits of the increase disproportionately help those working households at the bottom of the income scale although households in the bottom 20 percent received only 5 1 percent of national income 38 1 percent of the benefits of a minimum wage increase to 7 25 would go to these workers the majority of the benefits 58 5 percent of an increase would go to families with working primeaged adults in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution among families with children and a lowwage worker affected by a minimum wage increase to 7 25 the affected worker contributes on average half of the familys earnings thirtysix percent of such workers actually contribute 100 percent of their familys earnings a minimum wage increase would help reverse the trend of declining real wages for lowwage workers between 1979 and 1989 the minimum wage lost 31 percent of its real value by contrast between 1989 and 1997 the year of the most recent increase the minimum wage was raised four times and recovered about onethird of the value it lost in the 1980s income inequality has been increasing in part because of the declining real value of the minimumwage today the minimum wage is 33 percent of the average hourly wage of american workers the lowest level since 1949 a minimum wage increase is part of a broad strategy to end poverty as welfare reform forces more poor families to rely on their eamings from lowpaying jobs a minimum wage increase is likely to have a greater impact on reducing poverty the opponents of the minimum wage often claim that increasing the wage will cost jobs and harm the economy of course there is no credible study to support such claims in fact a 1998 epi study failed to find any systematic significant job loss associated with the 199697 minimum wage increase the truth is that following the most recent increase in the minimum wage in 199697 the lowwage labor market performed better than it had in decades and after the minimum wage was increased the country went on to enjoy the most sustained period of economic prosperity in history we had historic low levels of unemployment rates increased average houriy wages increased family income and decreased poverty rates studies have shown that the best performing small businesses are located in states with the highest minimum wages between 1998 and 2004 the job growth for small businesses in states with a minimum wage higher than the federal level was 6 2 percent compared to a 4 1 percent growth in states where the federal level prevailed so much for the discredited notion that aising the minimum wage harms the economy it does not but it increases the purchasing power of those who most need the money which is far more than can be said of the republicans devotion to cutting taxes for multimillionaires americans overwhelmingly side with progressive principles of rewarding hard work with a living wage in a recent poll conducted by the pew research center 86 percent of americans favored raising the minimum wage in the 2004 election voters in florida and nevada two states won by president bush overwhelmingly approved ballot measures to raise the minimum wage even in nevadas richest county 61 5 percent of douglas where bush received 63 5 percent of the vote voters supported raising the minimum wage fortythree percent of americans consider raising the minimum wage to be a top priority in contrast only 34 percent considered making the recent federal income tax cuts permanent and only 27 percent consider the passage of a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage as top priorities members of congress have legislated a minimum salary for themselves and have seen fit to raise it eight times since they last raised the minimum wage it is time we gave the americans we represent a longoverdue pay raise by increasing the minimum wage to 7 25 over 3 years even this amount does not keep pace with the cost of living the minimum wage would have to be increased to 9 05 to equal the purchasing power it had in 1968 and if the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as the salary increase corporate ceos have received it would now be 23 03 per hour"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in

fundamental commitment made from one generation to another instead of weakening it conveniently the budget agreement before us ducks responsibility for this reckless plan we know that privatizing social security would require borrowing 2 trillion over the next 10 years debt borrowed against our children and our grandchildren not surprisingly this inconvenient reality is left out of the

the american people deserve honesty and this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a

fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the

the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our veterans our values as

positive perspective a brighter outlook and hopefully a little more unifying message than we have just heard and frankly than we often hear in the united states house chamber especially by some of my good friends from the other side of the aisle we call this the official truth squad i thank the leadership and the conference for allowing me to come and share a few words tonight the official truth squad grew out of a frustration on the part of the freshmen class of the republican conference we all were elected in 2004 24 strong now 26 of us here in the united states house of representatives after a relatively few number of months we grew frustrated with the fact that there was a lot of misinformation and a lot of distortion and a lot of frankly deception that was going on here and so what we wanted to do was to put together a group of folks that would come to the house floor and try as best we could to provide some truth some facts to the situations that we address here in the united states house of representatives we have just gotten back from a week at home a district work period over the memorial day week i heard from constituent after constituent about two big issues one was illegal immigration obviously the largest issue we have to deal with as a nation right now but the second one in meeting after meeting after meeting with constituent after constituent all across my district on the north side of atlanta was people asking why on earth is congress so divided why is it so partisan why do you have the kind of sniping that goes on and i am loathe to answer that question because it is so difficult to understand why there are many in this chamber who are not interested in working positively or productively together it just boggles my mind these are not democrat problems or republican problems these are american problems and american problems deserve a united congress working together so what you have just heard in the last 15 minutes is an individual who will tell you that quote this is a republican congress problem well we do better if we work together the fact is that it is extremely difficult to get anything moving forward positively in congress without the support of many different folks and so we work better when we work together what you hear so often is what i call the politics of division the politics of division is so destructive they do a disservice to every single one of us in this nation i tried to put some words to the consequences of the politics of division and i think i have found a quote i have shared it with you before and it comes from the reverend william boetcker who was a philosopher and leader around the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century he described what he said was a social philosophy and he attributed it to abraham lincoln nobody can actually determine whether president lincoln actually said these words but reverend boetcker talked about them and i think they crystallize and capture my concern my suspicion about what the consequences are of this politics of division that is so destructive he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cant help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred and you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich now that kind of crystallizes i think what is a unifying american philosophy it is a philosophy that would serve us extremely well here in the united states house of representatives how often do you hear people just castigate out individuals who are more wealthy than others destroying the rich in an effort to build up the poor it doesnt work that way it doesnt work that way our system never has our system never has done that and so the official truth squad tries to bring some credibility and truth to these discussions we have adopted a motto which is a qubte from a wonderful united states senator daniel patrick moynihan from the state of new york and this quote i think makes it so that everybody has to be held accountable and what senator moynihan said is that everyone is entitled to their opinion and they are and opinions are here in the countless number everyones entitled to their opinion but theyre not entitled to their own facts everyones entitled to their opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts which is why it is so frankly troubling that the blue dog group gets up here night after night week after week and talks about how they want to be fiscally responsible you know we used to say that folks who were politicians that said one thing at home and did something different in washington werent being responsive to their constituents well the blue dogs have perfected the art of saying one thing in washington and doing another thing in washington and we will use some facts here are some facts you want to talk about facts during the fiscal year 2006 budget this was the plan of the blue dogs and the democrats instead of being responsible about spending they offered programs that would have spent 21 5 more billion dollars you didnt hear that from folks on the other side of the aisle that is the truth that is the truth how many in new taxes 54 billion in new taxes talk to me now about what the truth is and what is being proposed and what is being said in washington and what is being voted on in washington and what is being said back home how many mandatory savings the republican conference all on their own in a very difficult way because we got no cooperation from folks who will tell you one thing at home in fact they will tell you one thing that same thing in washington but they will do exactly the opposite we gained 40 billion this savings with the deficit reduction act earlier this year how much mandatory savings on the part of the other side zero zero that is the truth that is a fact that is not opinion that is a fact the bills that they brought forward the blue dogs my good colleague just before me talked about wanting a balanced budget we have given them an opportunity to vote on a balanced budget in fact we did so just 3 or 4 weeks ago here on the floor of the house of representatives not a single one of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that balanced budget not one they talk about making certain that you pay as you go that you only pay for programs that you have the money for we have offered that on the floor of the house we do not get the support of the blue dogs they talk about having a rainy day fund doesnt it make wonderful sense to have a rainy day fund because we know year after year after year we will have emergencies like katrina or other emergencies there is an average of 20 billion annually where there are emergencies that need federal money during the course of any given year on average 20 billion so what does the republican congress propose that we are being accused of doing in fact what we do propose is a rainy day fund in the budget that we just adopted for fiscal year 2007 how many members of the blue dog how many of those 37 blue dogs voted in favor of that rainy day fund not one not one same number that we got when we talk about the mandatory savings zero not one of them support it i want to talk about a little positive information about this economy because you wont you may not hear about it on the nightly news you may not read about it in your newspapers you certainly wont hear about it from some folks who want to make certain that they practice this politics of division and this politics of deception did you see the new job figures last month the month of may 75 000 new jobs created and this economy over the past 12 months has created 1 9 million new jobs 1 9 million new jobs more than 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 6 percent lower than the average of the 60s 70s 80s and 90s a picture oftentimes says it so much better than any of us can so let me see if i can show you the picture of that kind of job growth that we have seen over the past 3 years here it is on a graph here we are in january 2002 with unemployment up at about 5 7 to 8 percent here is the job growth at that time and then on the bottom we have the number of months going by we havent even gotten to this month but earlier this year what has happened to the unemployment rate it has gone down whats happened to the job growth it has gone up significantly again 5 3 million new jobs since august of 2003 so the curious individual the individual who wanted to solve problems and work positively and productively on behalf of the american people would say well what happened when this seemed to change when unemployment h3420 co rates began to go down when the job growth began to go up what happened what occurred there well lo and behold you know what happened we had tax decreases appropriate tax decreases responsible tax decreases by making certain that americans got to keep more of their own money and when you allow americans to keep more of their own money what happens they spend it and they save it in wise ways and then the economy flourishes so because of the tax policies of this congress of this congress and this administration we have seen increasing job growth and decreasing unemployment what else about the economy is going on revised reports show the fastest real gross domestic product growth in over 22 years in the first quarter real gdp growth grew at an annual rate of 5 3 percent in the first quarter productivity increased at an annual rate of 3 7 percent in the first quarter hourly compensation real hourly compensation rose at a 3 2 annual percentage rate in the first quarter personal income increased at an annual rate of 6 7 percent in april since january of 2001 real after tax income has risen by 12 9 percent why mr speaker because of tax policies appropriate responsible tax policies put in place by this congress this administration this leadership and oftentimes in spite of what you hear at home and in spite of what you hear by my friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes more often than not frankly without a single individual helping on that side of the aisle in fact they come down and they say these tax decreases the tax reductions will destroy the economy will throw people out on the streets but you know what happens what happens is that unemployment goes down job growth goes up and in fact sometimes they will even say that at 1 minute and then they will vote for the same thing that they just said was awful just said was awful just a moment before that truth is so doggone important in the public discourse remember you can have your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts you have got to talk about facts and that is why the official truth squad takes the opportunity as often as possible to come down here and talk about facts talk about facts with the american people because the politics of division again does a disservice to every single american we live in a glorious nation a wonderful nation a nation that is still seen by men and women around the world as a beacon of liberty and a repository of hope i am proud to serve in the united states house of representatives and to have the opportunity to share a positive productive perspective and vision with my colleagues and i hope that we can be joined by more and more colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we work to"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding let me make one comment about your chart i am a cpa i have spent 30plus years assisting clients in dealing with our very complicated very convoluted federal income tax code whether it is individually or corporations or other businesses any system that is based on a fair concept is flawed because what is fair to one per sons view is not necessarily fair to somebody elses point of view when you base a public policy this broad and expansive and quite frankly invasive on fairness then you set yourself up for a constant argument and constant battle about what is and is not fair clearly your chart shows a differential between the wealthiest folks in this country and the folks that are on their way up to hopefully becoming the wealthiest in this country certainly they have got that opportunity with hard work and applying themselves to that so i would just like to point out that maybe we need a different system maybe sometime next year let us have this conversation about a different way to collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this federal government and we will have that conversation i would like to comment though on health care and individual responsibility i think it is universally recognized and that is a hard thing to state with a straight face but i think it is universally recognized that americans enjoy the finest health care delivery system in the world you yourself have been an integral part of that as an orthopedic surgeon and your wife i believe is an anesthesiologist members of the delivery system that this country enjoys we have got a flawed payment system and i am not sure how we got to this point and place but we are here we have got a system that if you ran your car insurance program the same way we run health insurance then each time you needed to change the oil in your car or new tires you would file an insurance claim that is not how we work our cars we figure out a way to operate our automobiles out of our normal monthly budget we budget for that and take care of those incidentals we do have car insurance for the catastrophes for wrecks for destruction and theft those kinds of things those catastrophic deals our health care system is flawed in that quite frankly i get the services you provide me the services and someone else pays for those services in that scheme i am not as concerned about the cost of those services as i ought to be because i am not writing a check to help out with that so i have no incentives so to speak to ask you are there alternatives to what you have proposed is there another way to do this or cheaper way can we do it at some other hospital that can be a little less expensive than the one you typically practice at because i am writing those checks getting personal responsibility back into the health care system getting a system in which i have a viable interest in asking that question we may ask that question on every other single thing that we do how much is that going to cost we may not ask it out loud but we make a costbenefit analysis each time in our head each time we make a purchase on something such as how do i want to pay for that we do not do that in medicine and it needs to be communicated to all of us that that is okay to do in medicine there are some things in medicine you do not ask emergency or catastrophic kinds of things you go get that thing there is an awful lot of medicine that i think is subject to a circumstance where we can ask what that costs and i think just doing that would begin to drive down those costs as the example i went for an annual checkup a year or so ago and had an issue the physician said well i can prescribe a course of antibiotics that is about 300 a month and 3 months from now that condition will clear up i have got a prescription drug card so it was going to cost me 15 or whatever i said 900 he said yeah i said well what happens if i do not do that he said in about 3 months it will clear up i made a costbenefit analysis and decided that i would forgo the antibiotic treatment and go with the professional judgment it was my decision i need to stand behind that decision and if 3 months later my condition had gottenworse and i had other problems that may have been fixed if i had taken a different tack i cannot go back on the doctor or should not and sue the doctor or the pharmacy or whatever sue anybody that is still breathing because of a decision that i made personal responsibility is not only taking responsibility for paying for health care but also reclaiming your health care decisions because those are yours you are responsible for that and you yourself know there will be the occasional bad outcome to any procedure to any field and that is just nature doctors are not perfect or hospitals none of us are those legitimate just bad outcomes is just the system and we ought to take personal responsibility for that i had several doctor clients and to a person if they did something wrong if they created an issue or made something that aggravated something with a patient they were going to fix it period no matter what it was but in many instances they used their absolute best professional judgment to treat a patient and they just got a bad outcome that is life so this personal responsibility issue that i am talking about is decisions for what health care you do get or you do not get and the costs i think the health savings accounts that we have instituted in certain instances will help us do that so that putting away money in a health savings account if you have a normal monthly kind of an expense come up i have to decide do i take that money out of my health savings account that is growing or do i figure out a way to do it out of this months budget or my normal operating budget so bringing that personal discipline back to the table in the arena of health care is not the absolute overall magic bullet but it is a piece of the fix that is health care costs i appreciate this opportunity to share this hour with the gentleman and i look forward to hearing the remainder of the gentlemans comments from a learned colleague in an arena that is obviously of vital importance to all of americans"], [0.9999958276748657, 0.9999958276748657, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume today we will debate four important bills that make modest reforms to the occupational safety and health act these measures ensure that small business owners who make good faith efforts to comply with health and safety laws are dealt with fairly and equitably by the occupational safety and health administration nearly every employer recognizes that improving workplace safety is good for business and it is good for workers employers are subject to fierce competition both at home and abroad and must compete in the face of high taxes skyrocketing health costs escalating litigation and burdensome government regulations these osha reform bills are designed to improve worker safety and enhance the competitiveness of small businesses that are the real engine of job growth in our country the unitedstates economy continues to grow and more and more employers are continuing to hire workers each month last week the labor department reported that more than 3 7 million new jobs have been created since may of 2003 marking 25 consecutive months of sustained job creation but we need to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire new workers and compete in our economy that is why these bills are so important since republicans assumed leadership of congress 10 years ago we have undertaken considerable efforts to make bureaucracy more responsive and more accouintable to workers and taxpayers let me give just a few examples we stopped unwarranted and invasive osha regulations proposed by the clinton administration that would have held employers liable for the safety of their employees who work from home we stopped one of the most over reaching attempts at regulation in our nations history by repealing an irresponsible and unworkable ergonomics regulation that would have cost employers billions of dollars and killed millions of jobs we have dealt with the problem of costly unfunded mandates by ensuring that congress does not pass expensive legislation and then place it onto the backs of state and local governments this decade of progress on regulatory reform should give every american confidence that congress is making positive steps every year to improve government accountability and today we want to take one more step one more positive step to help improve workplace safety i think a goal we all share osha under the bush administration has made significant efforts to supplement traditional enforcement programs with cooperative partnerships between the agency and employers i am pleased to report these voluntary programs have proven successful in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses in fact if we look at this chart workplace injuries and fatalities have declined significantly during the bush administration and as this chart shows workplace injuries and illnesses have declined significantly under the bush administration to their lowest point in history to a rate of just five injuries or illnesses per 100 workers moreover workplace fatalities have made similar declines there has been a 5 8 percent reduction in workplace fatalities since the bush administration took office and that is significant progress why has such progress been miade because under this administration osha and employers have started to work together more cooperatively and more proactively to solve workplace safety problems before injuries and fatalities occur a gao report released last year said voluntary partnerships between osha and employers have considerably reduced the rates of injury and illness and have fostered better working relationships with osha improved productivity and decreased workers compensation costs we strongly support osha targeting the bad actors that defy the law and compromise the safety of their workers but we also need to recognize that most employers are good actors who work hard to address job safety concerns no employer wants to deal with unnecessary osharelated litigation and escalating attorneys fees that would result from that enforcement most employers want to comply with the law and the offer of assistance from osha is enough to provide the incentive they need to make this investment employers will use these resources because safety pays the reform measures we will consider today are proposals that while fairly modest in substance are important to small business owners who struggle every day to comply with the complex osha laws and provide a safe working environment for their workers while facing an increasingly competitive worldwide economy efhployers who make good faith efforts to comply with osha standards deserve to be treated fairly and have their day in court and these commonsense bills will help ensure that they receive that opportunity the first bill on tap today the occupational safety and health small business day in court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary 15day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason this bill essentially codifies administrative action taken by the labor department last year and ensures appropriate disputes are resolved based on merit rather than legal technicalities it passed the house with strong bipartisan support last year and it deserves every members support i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.999994158744812, 0.999994158744812, 0, "i rise in support of the resolution before

be far down the road to affecting a paradigm shift in the middle east one which would replace potentates dictators and repression with representative governments transparency and opportunities for both men and women if we were to fail the cost would be incalculable it would be a reaffirmation for many in the world that the united states lacked the fortitude to see a mission through toits completion it would embolden terrorists the world over threaten those states in the middle east such as jordan and israel that are friends of the united states 1000 regardless the situation in iraq is what it is there is no question iraq is a petri dish for terrorists now our main nemesis in iraq is called al qaeda in iraq thus our activities in both iraq and afghanistan are now clearly linked to a global war on terror there is no other way to view the situation i am eager to build on the recent successes in iraq i truly hope that we have turned a corner with the death of zarqawi and the forming of the government if voter turnout is any indication theiraqi people are eager for democracy they had a higher voter turnout in iraq than we did in virginia for our gubernatorial race but make no mistake what we are trying to do in iraq has been and will continue to be extraordinarily difficult even with zarqawi gone there are many dangerous people who will stop at nothing to stop us i dont support a public date of certain withdrawal from iraq doing so creates an untenable situation for our forces and our iraqi allies and presents a real gift of predictability to the enemy but there has to be a sense of urgency we are in a war that we have to win but we cannot plod along indefinitely our founding fathers had 13 years between the beginning of the american revolution the ratification of the constitution and the inauguration of george washington we dont have that luxury in iraq our troops are giving their lives in iraq our country is spending hundreds of billions of dollars we cant pull the rug out from the under the iraqis but we cant babysit the situation either we dont have time to waste on activities that are ineffective we dont have money to waste on bad equipment and

mistakes in management and oversight but remember this is the first time we have contracted this extensively in a combat situation everything about doing business everything in a war zone is difficult and costly and it is disingenuous to deny this if we are going to see this mission through successfully th~ere must continue to be vigorous comprehensive constant oversight to ensure we stay on the

some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research that is true of the figures in the country we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here they have visited my office they have visited your offices there is not a person in this room who has not had many many visits by people who have very very serious needs whose lives are going to be shortened i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases adult stem cells cannot do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do embryonic stem cell research has the ability perhaps to do much more than that people are going to get up and they are going to say well it hasnt done anything yet they were only discovered about 62 years ago if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america congress should never ever turn its back on this opportunity how are we going to get there how are we going to do embryonic stem cell research i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process they are then frozen they are generally used and well used the 400 000 embryos which are out there to help give birth to people who might not otherwise be able to have a child but at the end of the process a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo they may do a variety of things with it they may as has been discussed here give it up for adoption they may decide to have it discarded as hospital waste that is where the vast almost all of them actually go as hospital waste we want to give them the opportunity to say within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste sitting at that table to be put over here and the state to be able to do the research that is what we need to do we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind i rise today im support of h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career ijust like all of youhave had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded and the 820 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility i am their voice in the congress of the united states some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research and frankly the answer is simplethose 800 000 constituents we estimated that aboutonehalf of all visits to my office are about health care and about onehalf of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are sufferingfrom juvenile diabetes alzheimers cancer parkinsons hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican partys drive to double funding for the nih and that funding has gone toward the basic science needed to find cures and treatments to our most debilitating diseases but in the past few years the number one topic on these groups minds was embryonic stem cell research one little girl stands out in mind i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware olivia was two months old when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking olivia is now 6 and has never known life without diabetes she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns at the time the compromiseto allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derivedseemed quite reasonable but as we know unfortunately the number of lines eligible for research once as high as 78is now only at 22 with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the presidents policy in an ethical manner i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy the legislation we are going to vote on today h r 810 the stem cell research enhancement act which has the backing of the medical groups the scientists the research universities and the patient advocacy groups mirrors the presidents ethical requirements i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely 1 embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need 2 the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded and 3 the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement you may ask what is differentwe simply lift the arbitrary august 9 2001 date it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do 1 no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life this is prohibited by law 2 no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research under our legislation it is up to the couple to decide what should happen to their embryos embryos can be adopted or donated embryos can be frozen for future family building embryos can be discarded after that initial decision is made and if a couple decides to discard the embryos our legislation would allow those couples to make a second choice do they want to donate them to research an embryo or blastocyst is about 250 cells and the inner cell mass is about 100 cells and that is where the stem cells come from they are created in a petri dish are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head of the 400 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the unitedstates about 2 percent are discarded annuallythat is about 8 00011 000 embryos that could be slated for research allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another persons life the bottom line is when a couple has decided to discard their excess embryos they are either going to be discarded as medical waste or they can be donated for research throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists this is simply not true umbilical cord cells are adult stem cells and they are limited adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are they are difficult to harvest and grow and

adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotentthat is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely

we must explore research on all types of stem cells but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy the nih is the right place to oversee this research because it can regulate the ethics it provides for scientific collaboration and peer review and promotes publication so all breakthroughs are reported and all scientists have access to the latest research discoveries without nih oversight there are no guidelines as to how this research should be conducted the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world as science continues to move rapidly forward we need to continue to lead the way but we are not why should we waste one more year one more day forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable does this congress really want to look back 10 years from now and say that we were the ones holding the treatments up or do we want to be the

exciting day a historic day i want to thank the leadership for allowing me the opportunity to host an hour of the official truth squad we started this 2 years ago and did so because there were many of us who were concerned about the fact that on the floor of the house oftentimes the words that were spoken and the presentations made oftentimes bore little resemblance to the truth so we began 2 years ago to institute the official truth squad to try to come to the floor like this every so often and try to do it at least once a week to bring light to issues of concern to the american people today is no different this is a historic day the first day of the 110th congress it was an exciting day the first day is always exciting it is full of families and celebration and children on the floor of the house sharing the remarkable experiences of members being sworn in oftentimes new members of which we have today as you know over 5 0 new members in the house cf representatives so it is an important occasion we heard a lot of discussion leading up to today and that discussion was culminated in november by a vote by the american people and the american people voted and changed the majorities in the house of representatives and in terms of the american peoples decision it was the right decision for them because it was the decision that they made at the polls it was important for us it is important for all of us to appreciate that yes they did the american people spoke i think one of the things that they said is that they want a different process here they were tired of some of the things that had gone on here in the past so they spoke and said a different process is needed many of my friends on the other side of the aisle as you well know talked as we led up to the november elections about the need for civility in congress which we believe wholeheartedly about the need for openness which is imperative for us to have in our system of government openness and then fiscal responsibility kind of three tenets that they brought to the american people i would concur with each and every one of those i would suggest that those principles by the nowmajority party ought to last longer than one day of speeches so we have some concerns about what has occurred and some disappointments already and we would like to share some of those with the american people as we are presenting things to the house of representatives this evening now in pointing these out the purpose is not to say how good it was when we were in the majority because it can always be better as many of us talked in the election process the campaign process we talked about the kinds of improvements that we would like to see the purpose is to shed light on both word and deed and it is important because what folks say and what they do it is important for the american people to know that those two things are the same in our system of government we have elections where people go to the polls and vote they vote based on a lot of things but probably most impor tantly they base their vote on the fact that they believe that the person that they voted for and what they said they were going to do was in fact what they were going to do so when individuals say things that they are going to do once they get into office and then they break those promises then it is important for people to be held accountable the american people do that time and again it is also important as a member of now the minority party for us to hold the majority party accountable one of the responsibilities we have in our dynamic form of government is to hold them accountable and we do this as a matter of principle it is a matter of principle and we believe it is a matter of principle that elected officials ought to be held accountable for not just what they say but also what they do to that end i would like to share some quotes we are going to talk a fair amount tonight about what individuals have said in the past oftentimes the recent past and what we have some concerns with in terms of their action this first quote is from the declaration on honest leadership and open government which was one of the democrat partys publications that they had prior to the election the quote there is from the nowspeaker it says our goal is to restore accountability honesty and openness at all levels of government it is a noble goal it is a noble goal we would agree with that it is just important that when one says that that is your goal and that is your purpose that in fact you comply with that the washington post on december 17 2006 said speaker pelosi is determined to try to return the house to what it was in an earlier era where you debated ideas and listened to each others arguments where you debated ideas and listened to each others arguments that is important as we go through the process of what is of concern to many of us here in the house of representatives about how the process is already being implemented this is a quote from july of 2005 from representative rahm emanuel now the chairman of the democrat caucus and he voiced some frustration about the inability to have either an amendment or a vote on the floor he said let us have an up and down vote dont be scared dont hide behind some little rule come on out here put it on the table and let us have a vote so dont hide behind the rule if this is what you want to do let us have an up and down vote it is important to remember that the purpose of that was to say that every member of the house of representatives ought to have the opportunity to in fact offer amendments and have their opportunity for people to say yes i agree with you and your amendment or your bill or no i dont here is a quote from representative steny hoyer nowthe majority leader in october of 2005 the one that i would like to highlight here is a quote where he said these provisions are an outrage talking about the rules that were in place these provisions are an outrage and this process is an outrage as one member of this body complained once again the vast majority of americans are having their representatives in congress gagged by the closed rule committee fl 2100 now we will talk a fair amount this evening about what a closed rule is and why representative hoyer in october 2005 would have made that comment saying that the representatives were being in effect disenfranchised in the house of representatives this quote comes from our now speaker speaker pelosi who in a letter to thenspeaker denny hastert in october of 2006 said and this is an important quote because this is one of those promises that were made prior to the election and that i believe affected individuals all across this nation and what they were going to do when they went to the polls in november this again is from nowspeaker pelosi to thenspeaker hastert and what this says is more than two years ago i first sent you democratic proposals to restore civility to the congress i reiterate my support for these proposals today we must restore bipartisanship to the administration of the house reestablish regular order for considering legislation and we will talk about what that means and ensure the rights of the minority whichever party is in the minority restore the rights of the minority whichever party is in the minority the voice of every american has a right to be heard we would certainly concur with that and again we will point out some of the concerns and disappointments that many of us have about the process that we have already seen in place today this quote here is from a washington post article of january 2 2007 2 days ago and it says as they prepare to take control of congress this week and face up to the campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness democrats are planning to largely sideline republicans from the first burst of lawmaking instead of allowing republicans to fully participate in deliberations as promised after the democrats victory in the november 7 midterm elections democrats now say they will use house rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures and so we think it is important for people to be held accountable for what they say and what they do we also think it is important as a matter of principle for people to do what they say they are going to do especially elected officials so i place into the record an article which appeared in the washington post on january 2 that included this quote in addition to that an editorial which appeared in the

it our first responders need it and we need it to provide the incentives in place to help with our patrol i want to mention because there was so much we wanted to cover tonight but i cannot leave without saying this one thing it really points an example of our lack of response we have talked about it to the border security problem but look at our lack of response properly in this budget to our gas problem every basic issue that needs to be responded to american people know we did not get to this point by just one thing oil companies have a lot to do with it but their profits are not the real reason the real reason is we have a serious shortage because we are being held hostage by most of the petroleum producing countries and because we have not planned properly with our refineries and because we have not planned properly with our automobiles and our guzzlers and even when we move to do that with one example i just point out to you the hybrid cars the one good program that we could use would be that there is nothing in the budget that even approabhes what we need to do to give our american people true incentives serious tax incentives to purchase hybrid cars hybrid cars whose engines are run on a combination of electric batteries and gasoline the key to our success as far as bringing down these energy crises and stop making us so dependent on these other volatile nations for our energy is to lower our consumption of oil and to lower our consumption means we need to go elsewhere to find the fuel mix to do it we can do it we have got the american knowhow you take the hybrid engine they have got what is it 2 000 for the tax credit now it is going up to 3 400 but then there is all kind of complications in that make at so confounding that dealing with it is for the first manufacturer to produce 60 000 cars then it goes down every quarter it just gets so complex that the poor american people do not even have a clear angle with which to attack it and go out and purchase the automobiles we need to clear that up we need to put in this budget that we will give a 50 percent increase at least on the tax incentives and make that a going up scale so that we can get more hybrid cars running we need to go and start giving incentives to farmers who are producing corn and soybeans creating a new industry with which to produce ethanol and mix that with our gasoline to be able to carry our fuet much like brazil is doing we need to enrich conservation programs to conserve our energy and then finally we have got to do all we can to get the american people out of their automobiles the commuter rail and with mass transit but where is the will where is the direction where is the encouragement where is the inspiration to say let us go america we can do it

see how that evolves over the next few minutes but i want to begin the discussion on an issue that i think is really incredibly important to each and every one of us in this country and certainly as members of congress representing so many people constituents come to us i think every day and they may not say what are you doing about energy but they certainly come to us and say what is going on with the high price of gasoline we go to the pump we see the price going up sometimes more than one time in a day and we have seen prices well over 3 a gallon and what we know of course is that consumers are paying 100 percent more than they were paying 5 years ago the price at the pump was about 1 44 1 50 the average price of gasoline 5 years ago and now we are seeing prices certainly well over 3 a gallon and this is at the same time of course that we are seeing record profits from the oil industry and certainly my constituents say to me what is going on what can we do about this why isnt something more happening and they do understand there are some cauies of this but what i would like to discuss this evening is what is going on and what we have been doing about it and what we have not been doing about it that we should i think that is really what i am most concerned about as i see these issues in my district not only for gasoline we are not in the right season yet but we certainly know that home heating oil and home heating fuel has gone up as well in fact i commissioned a study in pennsylvania to see what the price was for home heating oil last winter and we saw increases on the average in pennsylvania of over 700 a year for a family that is a lot of dollars particularly for somebody od a fixed income young families struggling to make ends meet and of course making some of the choices are really very difficult for families and in fact what we are hearing is that families are telling us that it matters that they have seen a real effect when they see transportation and home heating costs going up an average of 75 percent increase over what they saw even in 2001 so what are we seeing what are we doing about this what do we expect to do there is certainly discussion on the floor about this issue and i know as democrats we have stood and really made quite a few suggestions some very specific as far as what we can do immediately the one specific one of course was what about price gouging are we seeing the price of gasoline go up because in fact there was some inappropriate illegal activity we have some preliminary information about that unfortunately we do not have a federal definition of price gouging so it has been really difficult to be able to say specifically whether in fact that is really what has been going on and what can we do more immediately to help make sure that the oil industry is doing all that it can to get us more affordable gasoline but there is no question that those are shortterm solutions those are not longterm solutions and what many of us feel is that we should be acting on longterm solutions and we should have been doing it already and why are we not doing it today because what we do today matters next year the year after and for years in the future so what are we doing to make sure that there is an adequate supply of energy in this nation are we smart enough tobe doing the kind of innovation and research that we know we need to do to be able to do this of course the answer is that we are that the answer has to be to diversify our energy sources to look at the different ways the innovations that are out there and bringing different kinds of fuel to our vehicles and to our homes and we have seen that already we have had numbers of our members talk about biofuels and the opportunity for ethanol we have just seen in my region of the country and we have seen it elsewhere in the country the fact that we now have mixed gasoline and ethanol we have 5 percent ethanol coming into our tanks in the philadelphia area that switch was just made a couple of months ago but we also know that you can have a flexible fuel vehicle you can fuel your vehicle with 85 percent ethanol well that is made out of corn in this country does that mean we reduce our reliance on foreign oil absolutely and should we be doing more of that how do we actually begin to make the kind of investments that really would matter where we can actually say we are using the kind of research the kind of smart scientists the engineers the innovation that exists in this country to bring new fuel options to our vehicles and to all of us so that we have a diversity we have more choices as consumers and then in fact there was an article in the inquirer just this morning that the oil executives themselves are saying this is a question of supply it is also a question of demand if there is less demand that would make a difference in price as well a report i heard said if we couldjust reduce demand by 3 percent in this country we could in fact start to see a reduction in prices so we have some real opportunities here and of course long term if we canstart to look at biofuels to be able to get them going be able to get the production up really much faster then we really have the opportunity to bring down the cost of fuel in this country for our automobiles now of course tied to that there is something many of us also believe and that is that we ought to be calling on the automobile manufacturers to produce more fuelefficient vehicles more hybrids more flexible fuel vehicles and more gasolinedriven vehicles that ae more fuel efficient and they can do it they know how to do it we need to make them do it more quickly and to be able to create that option for us so that we as consumers all of my constituents all of my fellow congressmens constituents all americans have greater flexibility and can make choices about what are the right kinds of vehicles for them to drive what is the most fuelefficient way for us to be handling our owntransportation needs so i will just say that those are just some of the ideas in fact there are so many ideas this is one of the things that when constituents ask what can you do i say we should be investing in serious ways in this country in these new technologies and then we should be insisting that our automobile manufacturers and our purchasers as well start to participate in this there are so many ideas out there i see a colleague of mine has joined us and i am excited about that because he is someone who is very knowledgeable about this whole area and what we could be doing but when we see the city of philadelphia that i represent that the new city buses they are buying are hybrid buses that can make a really big difference all of our cities should be doing that all of our communities should be doing that what about school buses what can we do to make them more fuel efficient these are things that we really need to be working on and i will say two of the things i have only been focusing on access to the energy we need and to price and the concern that consumers have on that but there are two other aspects of this that are very critical for us to understand and that is that of course it has an environmental effect if we continue to burn fossil fuels at the rate we have been doing that we actually continue the kind of pollution we have we cannot just have rhetoric about reducing emissions we need to take it really seriously if we plan to protect this earth we live in and protect the environment and the consequences that we have seen of some of the changes in the environment the increasing number of storms hurricane katrina is of course one of the examples that is in all of our minds and we are just approaching of course a new hurricane season the third point i was going to make in addition to cost and availability of fuel and the energy we need as well as the environmental effects is of course the third area which is our national security we all understand i hope we do increasingly understand our reliance on foreign oil sixty percent of the oil that we use is imported we need to reduce if not eliminate our reliance on foreign oil it changes the relationships that we have with nations that are not always friendly to us so we need to have a much different relationship to foreign oil than we do and that is we have to end our reliance on foreign oil but that is not going to be done unless we start to really seriously invest in alternative fuels and renewable energy sources both for our vehicles and of course for our homes as well so i am going to ask my colleague to join us i did want to also say that i hope we can in our discussion also get to a little bit of a discussion about what consumers can do what can individual americans do that could really change the way we use energy put more pressure on us on congress to create those alternatives someone asked me well where can you buy ethanolmixed gasoline where can you buy e85 in pennsylvania well the answer is there is one station in lancaster and there is one station in pittsburgh if you live in philadelphia that is a very long to drive to fill up your tank and not acceptable so we need to be kickstarting this we need to not just do a little bit wouldnt that be nice lets do that little project over there lets see how that goes we need to make a serious investment that changes dramatically the kind of energy options that we have for our automobiles for our homes for our daily lives and only by doing that will we be able to protect the environment for the future will we be able to end our reliance on foreign oil will we be able to bring down the cost of energy for our cars and for our homes if we dont do it now we are going to be having this same discussion only more seriously in the years to come so as democrats we have had a number of proposals but one of the leaders in really putting forward a new energy policy for this country and it is a wonderful one it is called the new apollo energy act i guess we would like to see if it gets to be an act and i would want to really encourage it and i am delighted that my colleague congressman jay inslee has joined us to talk a little bit about what that would do and how it would get us started in a very very serious way in changing the way we create the energy for ourselves for our homes and for our businesses"], [0.03864556550979614, 0.5386455655097961, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i
