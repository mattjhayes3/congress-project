in american history student loan debt actually exceeded credit card debt which again by itself is just a huge statement in terms of the challenges that families middle class families and working families are facing today in terms of trying to deal with the cost of higher education the value of a higher education degree or posthigh school degree which is sometimes debated in the media still i believe is indisputable and the statistics certainly demonstrate that at a time when our national unemployment rate is 8 3 percent if you drill down deeper youll learn that for those with less than a high school degree the unemployment rate is 16 5 percent those with a high school degree its 10 7 percent those with some college is 8 5 percent and those with a bachelors degree or higher is 4 5 percent so the stakes could not be higher for young people all across our country that we must deal with the mounting cost of higher education and provide mechanisms for them and their families to actually finance it and pay for it in 2007 the democraticcontrolled congress passed the college cost reduction act which was a terrific measure that cut the interest rates for the stafford student loan program the federally subsidized student loan program which provided some stability and affordability for middle class families from 6 8 percent down to 3 4 percent in addition we unfroze the pell grant program which is the workhorse of paying for college education all of it paid for by eliminating wasteful subsidies to banks that measure has a sunset this july the interest rate reduction of the college cost reduction act will in fact expire on july 1 unless congress acts president obama in his state of the union address a few nights ago raised this issue before all of us in the house and senate when he said when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july shortly after his address myself and congressman peters from michigan introduced h r 3826 which is a measure that would extend the 3 4 percent the lower interest rates on the stafford student loan program and in just a few days we have accumulated 55 cosponsors to this measure again the math is crystal clear if we do not act if we do not maintain those interest rates at 3 4 percent if congress does nothing the unitedstates public interest research group has calculated that for those students who take out the maximum 23 000 in subsidized student loans their interest payments will increase by 5 200 over a 10year repayment period and 11 300 over a 20year repayment period now if you told middle class families that if congress doesnt act on a measure like this your outofpocket costs are going to go up 5 200 for taxes there would be a huge hue and cry about the fact that congress must not let that happen well thats exactly the same situation we face today with the stafford student loan program again we know from the passage of the college cost reduction act that this is something that this body is capable of doing this past weekend i was with a family whose son is now in his junior year and as an undergraduate has almost a perfect 4 0 grade average very motivated to go into the health care field and he has already accumulated 100 000 in student loan debt we as a nation must address this problem the national college board which tracks graduation rates internationally reminds us that back in the 1980s the unitedstates was number one in the world in terms of graduation rates we have fallen to number 12 according to the national college board and the biggest reason that students are not finishing college is because of affordability and cost again the president laid out the challenge to the congress in his state of the union address we must not allow stafford student loan interest rates to double on july 1 1l 1010 we should pass h r 3826 we should get that to the president so that colleges and universities can help families plan their tuition payments for the upcoming year and not allow this

a group like planned parenthood would otherwise make available to them well look plant planned parenthood does not pay for anybodys abortion using taxpayers dollars that is clearly in the law its covered by the hart amendment if planned parenthood has abortion services it is completely separate it is not only separate from family planning services and others for which they get government funding they have to keep separate records its a completely different operation so the pence amendment is trying to strike the funds under the health and human services programs for the services that planned parenthood as an organization would provide for them now its not just family planning funds its all federal programs including medicaid and the community health centers program this organization serves 15 percent of all women in need of contraceptive services in the unitedstates and for millions of women it is their primary health care provider the place they go to not only for planning services but basic preventive health services such as cancer screenings take that money away from them theyre not going to be able to serve the women who need those services so where will those people go are they going to go to the community health centers well this particular funding bill takes out a billion dollars from the community health centers where else can they go are they going to look to the medicaid program one of the entitlements that the republicans most want to savage is medicaid then where can they go are they going to go to the exchange in a couple of years that will be available under the affordable care act of course not the republicans are trying to repeal that law what will be the consequences the consequences will not diminish the number of abortions the consequences will be to deny women and men who may go to a clinic or to planned parenthood in order to get basic medical services i think this is a serious mistake if youre against abortion be against abortion but dont take it out on planned parenthood because they serve abortion clients in a separate operation thats like saying i never want to pay for any services provided by a doctor even though its not abortion services i dont want that doctor getting any money for contraceptive services i dont want that doctor to be paid if hes providing screening for venereal disease i dont want that doctor to be paid for any other service because he might also without your funds being used provide abortion services when you look at this carefully this is trying to punish planned parenthood but the ones who get punished are the people who wont be able to get the family planning services and the preventive screening services that planned parenthood regularly provides and they wont be the only provider for many of these women because they have nowhere else to go if they cant afford to go see a private doctor and pay for it i thought it was amazing to hear an argument that was made on the house floor that one member didnt like money to go to planned parenthood because theyre competing with forprofit abortion services i just was stunned by that argument i didnt know what it meant except perhaps theyd like to have the private forprofit abortion services be able to provide the services instead of planned parenthood whatever happens there is another issue because federal dollars

system working and you can turn the economy around jfk understood that he did it it worked for him ronald reagan did it they said oh trickle down economics and all this kind of stuff but it worked in fact here is another chart this is the tax rate on the most wealthy people this is this red line it started at 90 percent its come down you notice as the tax on the wealthy people comes down the amount of federal revenues goes up now thats weird why would that be its the same principle you can overtax and basically run the economy into the dirt"], [0.4788973946124315, 0.021102605387568474, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding at the outset let me say i am proud to vote for this rule because it is an open rule and i commend the speaker for doing this its really an important step forward i believe in the history of this house let me say also that very reluctantly in its current form i will have to vote against final passage of this bill i say this because we are at a stage now where the threat level the homeland security threat level is the highest its been since september 11 the killing of bin laden has only made that worse we know also from bin ladens own records that he is aiming at maritime he is aiming at mass transit and he is aiming at our major cities yet we are cutting each of those programs by 50 percent a fifty percent cut now i can speak for new york in that i can tell you we have a thousand police officers we have a lower manhattan security initiative we have radiation detection i can go through a whole list of programs every dollar in those programs can be accounted for and i just cannot see why at a time when the threat level is the highest its been since september 11 that we are reducing homeland security grants by 50 percent the department was set up in the aftermath of september 11 to fight terror yet those grants are being reduced and i know there is anecdotal evidence that this program isnt working that isnt working i would say specify whats not working but dont take a meat axe dont cut across the board the way its being done here were talking about human life were talking about just a terrible threat to our cities terrible threat to our ports terrible threat to mass transit and for thoseand i understand the need to cut i understand that need tremendously having said that even from my strictly budgetary point of view you have one dirty bomb go off in one subway in boston new york or chicago and apart from the tragic loss of human life apart from the tragic loss of human life there will be incalculable economic devastation which will also cost billions and billions of dollars of lost revenue and jobs and have a terrible impact i lived through september 11 i know what it did to new york i know the impact it had then i dont want any other city any other area in the country to go through that again and yet were reducing our defenses at a time when they are most needed so with that i would just ask all the members to give chairman rogers the credit give chairman aderholt the credit but unfortunately i have to vote against this"], [0.4799033906310797, 0.020096609368920326, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 6649 the naval transfer act of 2012 as amended according to the secretary of the navy authority to transfer surplus vessels is an important element of the u s strategy for decommissioned ships it enables our navy to manage its inventory while strengthening ties with our key security partners and with allies by transferring ships that meet key operational requirements this legislation authorizes the transfer of 10 decommissioned oliver hazard perry class guided missile frigates to mexico to thailand to turkey and taiwan six of the 10 vessels would be authorized for transfer on a grant basis as excess defense articles under section 516 of the foreign assistance act mexico thailand and turkey would each receive two frigates with respect to turkey i remain greatly concerned with the deterioration in that countrys relations with and policy toward the democratic jewish state and our ally the state of israel since the 2010 flotilla incidenta crisis on the high seas that triggered a tailspin in turkishisraeli relationswe have witnessed a turkey that is increasingly hostile toward israel from its recall of its ambassador to israel its attempts to marginalize israel in other international fora and its continued occupation of cyprus to the embrace of the muslim brotherhood and its offshoots current turkish policy is unacceptable i will continue to challenge those and take steps to ensure for example that turkey is sanctioned for its activities regarding the iranian regime but the proposed transfer that were talking about today is not validation of the current turkish policy in the region it is about our nations longterm national security interests that is what this bill is all about turkey is a nato ally that we need to continue participating in joint antipiracy operations for which they would use these frigates it has even commanded the combined joint task force 151 fighting piracy in the gulf of aden and along the somali coast protecting american citizens who are traveling in that volatile region additionally in light of the deteriorating security environment in syria and turkeys critical role in that arena the department of defense feels that it was necessary for our foreign policy priorities and security objectives that turkey receive these transfers finally in 2010 the last time that congress authorized such naval transfers we approved the grant transfer of three osprey class minehunter coastal ships to greece but no transfers to turkey lastly these transfers are job creators here at home each frigate transferred will require 40 to 80 million of repair and refurbishment this represents economic benefit to the united states through labor and services during the transfer process as well as the potential for millions more in followon services equipment and training according to estimates from unitedstates sources each frigate transfer creates or sustains approximately 100 shipyard jobs and 50 services jobs in the unitedstates for approximately 6 months performing this ship transfer work in domestic shipyards that perform unitedstates navy overhauls and repairs lowers the cost of unitedstates navy maintenance by spreading costs over a wider base the end result is an overall lower cost to our unitedstates navy and thus for the american taxpayer the alternative to foreign ship transfers for ships no longer required by the unitedstates navy is to place the decommissioned ships into cold storage or have them be sunk navy funding is required for both the storage and the sinking option turning to the other four frigates these would be authorized for transfer to our close friends and ally taiwan the transfer of these four frigates is not only a symbol of our enduring commitment to a secure and democratic taiwan but will also provide the island with additional capabilities to conduct maritime security operations in the taiwan strait the legislation also requires that any expense incurred by the unitedstates in connection with a transfer authorized by this bill shall be charged to the recipient passage of this bill will help advance united states foreign policy interests and our broader national security requirements therefore i urge adoption and i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
