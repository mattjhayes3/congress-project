economic growth put social security benefits at risk and bury your children in a sea of red ink for the rest of their lives large deficits and underinvestment in education research and health care are not prescriptions for a healthy economic futurethey are prescriptions for economic stagnation and decline in my opinion this budget is immoral it asks the most from those who have the least and asks the least from those who have the most that fails the values test of eve y major religious faith in our society this budget makes it harder for millions of students to attend college by increasing the

signed numerous free trade agreements over the years but despite the promises made to sell them to an increasingly skeptical public they have manifestly failed to open foreign markets for unitedstates producers or even to limit predatory foreign commercial practices such as subsidizing dumping and exchange rate manipulation in fact the trade flows clearly shows that the main new accomplishments of these trade agreements have been to help unitedstates and foreignbrand automakers alike supply the american market from lowwage export platforms like mexico as symbolized by the ludicrously unequal auto tariffs left in place by unitedstates negotiators of china trade deals unitedstates policy on automotive trade with china is speeding down the same road and will likely produce the same results the united states still runs a small trade surplus in autos with china but since 2000 chinese auto eiports to the united states have outpaced the united states vehicle exports to china by a fourtoone ratio the unfair chinese automotive tariff equalization act can begin reversing this process and help put the unitedstates owned auto industry and the domestic manufacturing base as a whole back on

may 2004 the secretary of defense again turned to representative fowler the secretary appointed her along with two former secretaries of defense and a retired fourstar general to a blueribbon panel charged with providing the secretary with independent professional advice on issues related to the allegations of prisoner mistreatment and finally this house was a better place for tillie fowlers service she was a remarkable woman with a rare combination of passionate drive and dedication for what she believed and a caring spirit for the people around her she made people feel at ease and she always did anything she could to help others during lifetime of service she exhibited a striking presence of personality integrity and intellect that will be sorely missed i would like to yield to our

on the other side of the aisle and the gentleman from california who has done such great work in our committee and on issues dealing with iran and trying to secure the safety of our country as well as the middle east the gentleman has my respect and as he knows he has had my cooperation in the past and we appreciate his cooperation on this effort as well this legislation needed to come to the floor and we needed that type of bipartisan cooperation as well as cooperation with the members on this side of the aisle and the hard work of the staff of both the committee on international relations and the committee on science to ensure that we were able to get this legislation passed in time to prevent what would have been an embarrassment a major embarrassment to the united states of america which would have done irreparable damage to our credibility our space program would have been humiliated by the elimination of americas presence on the international space station having an international space station which we paid for then to be occupied and controlled by russians we have by this effort today and by this cooperation prevented that shortcoming that humiliation from happening but let me note it was never the intent of the authors of this part of the iran nonproliferation act that we should ever come to a crisis like this i can say that with certainty because i was the one who was involved with writing this portion of the iran nonproliferation act i felt at that time we should have taken care of this issue a long time ago with carrots rather than sticks i went to both the clinton administration and the bush administration years ago to ask them to offer russia an alternative to being involved with iran in terms of building nuclear facilities the clinton administration did not act and the bush administration did not act to prevent this crisis that we are averting right now at the last minute from happening thus for the record let us note that yes we have averted a crisis but a long time ago positive and responsibleactions by either the clinton administration or the bush administration could have prevented this from happening in a most important way let me note cooperation with russia in the space program is not inherently bad it is something that is inherently good it places the russian scientists working on positive programs such as cooperation with americas space program israel itself is vey involved with the russians in their space program russian rockets launch israeli satellites thus we know that it is not inherently tied to iran the cooperation with russia in space matters but let us make sure that by passing this today we in no way are belittling the argument about the importance of dealing with irans development of nuclear weapons this should be of concern to each and every one of us and passage of this bill does not lessen that concern whatsoever"], [0.29043371975421906, 0.20956628024578094, 0, "well i thank the gen

the newspapers and so i have had it a while thirtyseven the mood of this house as of late and million seniors are members and i feel especially coming from the demaarp is not typically a conservative ocrat side the message is one that i organization supportive of republican have seen before it is a message thrat ideas more typically they are sup we saw in the 1980s when ronald portive of the democrat line of reagan faced down the soviet union thought and yet they have supported and you had calls from the far left to this program the effect that president reagan was going to have a war with the soviets that he needed to acquiesce he needed to engage even as they ringed our allies in europe with ss20 missiles and yet ronald reagan stood tough he stood for a policy of peace through strength and at one point the soviets picked up the phone and said can we talk and when we talked we talked about the disassembly of the soviet empire sifnilarly he stood tough in central america and today those two nations in question el salvador and nicaragua have fragile democracies because of america today we are providing that military shield in iraq while we put this fragile government together a government based on something new in that part of the world freedom and representative government you know this has been done on the shoulders of the great american servicemen and women who serve us in that very troubled and difficult part of the world arid their job is dusty and dirty and sometimes bloody but it is worthwhile and what they are giving to us if we can stabilize that country and that neighborhood and have a country that has a benign relationship towards the united states will accrue to the benefit of generations of americans so now is the time to take heart now is

generations and as the mother of two young daughters i realize that we must tackle this inevitable reform of social security now and not defer the debate to future generations i applaud the president for his strong leadership and his vision women have a particularly large stake in social security reform and i thank my colleague the gentlewoman from florida for her leadership on this issue and we will hear from her later tonight social security may be actually reflecting a bygone america where most american women worked at home and received a spousal benefit based on their husbands earning today according to the government accountability office nearly 60 percent of american women participate in the labor force which helps make america the most productive economy in the worldi not only are more women working than when social security was formulated they are working in ways that the framers of this program could not have imagined the gao has also found that women are more likely to work part time and work intermittently as they may take time out of the labor force to rear children or care for their elderly parents however social security as currently formulated penalizes many of these working women for example a homemaker can receive a higher spousal benefit than a woman working in a lowwage job receives based upon her own earnings in some cases the household benefit from social security is no greater than if these women had never worked at all the fact is that under the current system social security earnings cannot be transferred or shifted should a woman unfortunately become a widow sadly this occurs all too often and a womans total household income can be greatly reduced if she was receiving benefits based on the earnings while her husband was alive compared to a widow whose benefits are based solely on her husbands earnings so social security should not penalize women in their old age because they decided to join the workforce rather than stay at home social security must be reformed to better protect women and the invaluable roles that they play in our economy and in our society we should reward those women who try to balance work in the home and work in the labor force and not ask them to choose one or the other by reforming social security to include private accounts we can ensure that women receive all of the benefits that they earn in the workplace as well as being entitled to rse h4965 those that their husbands have earned once they have passed on forty percent of elderly women in america rely on social security for 90 percent of their income i join president bush in assuring elderly women that social security reform will not impact their benefits by one penny at the same time the reforms that president bush has envisioned will safeguard social security for those womens grandchildren and for all of our children and grandchildren if we do not reform it social security will be a payasyougo system which is doomed to fail in the 1940s as we have heard many times when social security was designed there were 41 workers paying into the system for every person who was receiving benefits today there are only about three workers for every one person receiving benefits by the year 2042 when workers who are currently in their mid20s begin to retire the system will be bankrupt if we do not reform social security those of us who are drawing or who will draw benefits will be doing so at the expense of our offsprings future without reform we would also continue to penalize our daughters and our grandchildren for mixing a career in the workforce with a dedication to family life also 2 3 million hispanics receive social security benefits and 41 percent a majority of them women depend on it as their full source of income as the first hispanic woman elected to congress i am committed to ensuring that all women are protected and all are afforded every opportunity remember we are talking about american women here not republican women not democrat women but american women social security reform is too important an issue to be left to partisan politics"], [0.36781372129917145,
