reigns unopposed the right ceases to be such because it is no longer firmly founded on the inviolable dignity of the person but is made subject to the will of the stronger part and elsewhere in

instead there is a grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection in the case of intrinsically unjust law such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia it is therefore never

eliminating opportunities for waste fraud abuse mismanagement and unauthorized expenditures the committee on resources held three oversight hearings examining the manner in which the fish and wildlife service through its division of federal aid administered and executed the pittmanrobertson act and the dingelljohnson act the hearings of the committee on resources made it clear that funds committed for the administration and execution of these programs had not been used for their stated purposes and that there was a general lack of fiscal accountability and management throughout the programs h r 3671 stops wasteful spending and mismanagement of the wildlife and sports fish trust funds and allows more money to be distributed directly to the states for conservation programs the legislation fixes what the gao called quote one of the worst managed programs it had ever encountered by increasing accountability and restricting the administrative use of funds from the trust funds specifically h r 3671 restricts the use of administrative funds reserved from federal excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment to purposes directly related to the pittmanjohnson wildlife restoration act and the dingelljohnson sport fish restoration act further the legislation established 12 categories of authorized costs for the wildlife restoration act and sports fish restoration act and provides that administrative funds will be available for one fiscal year after which all unobligated funds will be returned to the states through the apportionment formula h r 3671 also requires the secretary of interior to certify in writing the amount apportioned to each state and the amount obligated for administering those programs in addition the wildlife and sport fish restoration programs improvement act provides grants from the savings generated from the administrative changes in the bill to enhance firearm and bow hunter education and shooting range construction the legislation also provides up to 2 5 million for the secretary of interior to make multistate conservation grants finally the legislation requires increased accountability within the fish and wildlife service through certification

happened is the historic average basically since the time of world war i in other words governments take as a percentage of all the activity in america what they call gdp has been about 20 percent we have been basically at or slightly below that number well right now we are at a postworld war ii high in terms of washingtons take as a percentage of the collective activity of working americans and if we actually really break out the number what we see is a large part of that income stream to the federal government is due to capital gains income and it is due to bonus income it is tied to this bull market well most certainly at some point this market is going to cool off and mr lindseys argument was that when it does so all of a sudden since it is income tax that is solving the problem

raise the obligation to put information in the record that frankly we do not want to have put in the federal registry it would not be in americas best interest but why if that be the case would the

i like to talk about joe jordans mexican food restaurant which is where my wife shirley and i went on our second date joe jordan and his family did not go into the mexican food business because they thought they were good at buying health insurance they went into the mexican food business because they were good at making and cooking mexican food and yet under our structure today joe jordan has to select the health insurance for his employees and they get no choice we can change that we could go back to a system where we gave individual people choice in health insurance and let them buy the health insurance that meets their needs and the key to that would be if the plan they bought did not satisfy their needs if they went out and bought an hmo because they thought it was the most costeffective type of care they wanted and that hmo did not service their needs or do a good job by them or their family they could fire that hmo and go hire another one the gentleman from oklahoma said we would not need a patients bill of rights if health care were a matter of choice but it is not we get it through our employers earlier this year i introduced legislation to give people choice to let them buy a health care plan of their own or to let their employer give them essentially the right to go buy with his funds their own health care plan with that kind of choice we would as the gentleman said we would not need a patients bill of rights because if their hmo did not treat them right they would fire that hmo and they would go buy an hmo that serviced them well and did a good job by them just like they do with their auto insurance company or homeowners insurance company or any of the decisions they make in there lives but we are at the point where we are debating on the floor of this house we have all year and indeed last year as well the issue of a socalled patients bill of rights i think it is important to talk about the differences and the choices in that legislation and why the bill that passed this floor is so bad and indeed would do damage to health care in america i would like to do that with the charts down there so the gentleman and i will trade places this chart right here kind of shows the fundamental question that faces america on the issues of health care for the working people of america who get a health care plan from their employer it is a simple straightforward question health care in america who should make the decision you get three choices hmos lawyers or doctors and patients i think the answer to that question is very obvious i think doctors together with their patients ought to make medical decisions in america but it is important to understand how the system works today the system works today to say doctors and patients do not get to make the choice no the system today provides that hmos make medical decisions indeed hmo bureaucrats often make medical decisions but somebody out there watching might say well why are lawyers on this chart that does not make any sense i thought it was a battle between hmos on the one hand and doctors and patients on the other hand well that is what one thinks it should be but that is not what it is because some of the legislation that has gone through this house and the legislation that the president talks about the legislation that is discussed by our democrat colleagues would not leave power in the hands of hmos indeed it would take power away from hmos but sadly it would not move that power over to patients and doctors it would instead move that power to trial lawyers and that will set health care back rather tragically since the gentleman is a doctor perhaps he would like to comment on that"], [0.6432342231273651, 0.3567657768726349, 1, "this evening i wish to address this body with respect to the problem of our nations debt and how we responsibly handle this debt in a time of budget surpluses we are indeed fortunate as americans to have the robust economy that we have experienced over the last 8 years it is unprecedented we have had the strongest sustained period of economic growth in the 220 year history of the united states of america at the same time we have a record debt i would like to begin my remarks by sharing vith my colleagues an anecdotal story that is commonly used in my home state of minnesota and it refers to two fictitious individuals named oley and lena i happen to be of scandinavian ancestry and one of my grandfathers was named oley so i do not know if it is mygrandfather but in any event the story goes as follows oley got up one morning and oley went outside to do his business in the outhouse and as he pulled up his bib overalls a couple of quarters fell out of his pocket and down into the hole well oley was disgusted he took out his wallet took off his watch and he threw them down the hole as well oley went back in the house and did not have much to say and lena said after a while well oley what is wrong why do you not talk to me olie just said humph she kept pressing him finally olie shared with his wife lena the account of what had happened out at the outhouse lena said well olie that was a dumb thing to do why did you throw your watch and wallet down the hole olie said to lena well you did not expect me to go down after 50 cents did you well this may be humorous and it may appeal to grade school children but on the other hand it holds a certain kernel of truth with respect to the problems that we face out here we struggle with the losses that we have had as americans the losses in terms of an enormous national debt we try to figure out what to do about it sometimes we think that by creating a little bit more debt and then going down and rescuing what we just created that maybe we have solved the overall problem but i submit that is not the case a lot like olie we go back into the house and there is a certain order to us and we really do not have any more to show than before we started i would like to just use a couple of charts here to illustrate this problem with the accumulating national debt and then i know i have some colleagues here and i would like to make sure that they join in the colloquy here this evening and that we fully inform the other members of this body as to the gravity of the situation and the opportunities that await us this first chart shows the accumulation of the debt that we have at the federal level in the united states this goes back to 1980 when the debt was approximately 1 trillion which would be about 4 000 at that time for every man woman and child in our country as my colleagues can see there is a tremendous amount of red ink by the time we get to 1998 the debt has exploded to 5 trillion it has expanded by more than 500 percent now it is up to about 5 7 trillion or about 20 000 for every man woman and child in our country so it is important for us as americans to understand that when we talk about a balanced budget it does not mean there is no debt indeed the debt is unprecedented when we think of 20 000 for every man woman and child in our country we are talking about a very serious situation it is not just the humor of an olie and lena story it is important for us to understand the difference between the words debt and deficit this next chart shows the birth and the sort of the difference between the debt and the deficit now remember that we had that 5 7 trillion debt the deficit is how much we have gone into debt each year it is an annual figure again if we go back to in this case we are going back to the 1970s 1969 we had a little bit of a surplus that was in president johnsons administration then in the 1970s during president nixon we have some losses we see the yellow during president fords administration with the green we have some more losses president carters administration now we can call it red ink it is getting red during president reagans administration we have an enormous amount of red ink during president bushs administration we can see the turquoise so these are deficits each year we are accumulating more debt that is what leads to the 5 8 trillion we talked about here is president clinton coming in we can see that we have a large deficit the first 4 years the fifth year it is a fairly modest size deficit then finally we begin to show some surpluses here in 1999 and 2000 so this talk about a surplus has to be understood against the fact that we have an existing 5 7 trillion debt we cannot be confused by the difference between the debt and the deficit it is kind of like we have got to go back to budgeting 101 i yield to the gentleman from texas to continue our discussion because there are many more developments here that are important for us to consider if we are going to do a

come to a point instead where there is no longer talk about occasional unionbusting but workers meet wholesale resistance to the development of unions in the workplace whereby most employers confronted with workers who want to join unions develop strategies to keep unions from even getting a vote on whether workers want a union in fact show me a society where the right to organize is in danger and i will show members a society without full democracy what has our society come to wall street is bursting at the seams we have had surpluses for years on end we have the best economy of the century and we do not want workers to organize to get a fair share of that economy we are sending people out off the welfare rolls as well we should and we do not want them to be organized so they can get a fair share so they can in fact support their families as they leave welfare what have employers to fear after all unions have to win a vote the way we have to win a vote in order to come back to this house every 2 years that is hard to do with todays demographics where workers are by no means automatically oriented towards unions why then do half of the employers threaten to shut down if

proved its worth in times of emergency and while the selective service system has been portrayed by some as an anachronistic vestige of a bygone era the fact remains that it is a necessary component for the defense of our nation admittedly the professionalization of the military has in some cases obviated the need to have a national registration system however should there ever be another global calamity such as the kind that occurred twice in this century with the selective service system our government would have the ready infrastructure in place to provide the necessary personnel resources to defend liberty this safety net is provided at minimal cost to the taxpayer and is well worth the investment i urge all my colleagues to vote for the cunningham spence amendment and restore the presidents recommendation to fund the selective service system"], [0.05119311809539795, 0.551193118095398, 0, "mr speaker i rise to celebrate the inclusion of the violence against women act in the trafficking victims protection act i want to thank the gentleman from new jersey for supporting this effort to do so i remember a latin phrase meaning after the struggle comes the reward this has been

will we can all celebrate the message being sent to women everywhere when we pass this legislation that womens minds and bodies are their own by passing this conference report we empower millions of women around the world to escape from pain and fear this version of the violence against women act combines the strongest programs of both the house and senate bills we will never have a bill that meets every need of every victim and child but this bill is the strongest commitment that congress has ever made to fighting domestic violence and sexual assault i am proud of the bill i am proud of the dozens of members and staff who worked tirelessly to maintain the programs and the funding to meet the horrifying need of millions of victims to be safe from both immediate and longterm danger in

three desperately needed categories services and training for officers and prosecutors or stop grants grants to encourage arrest policies and rural state grants with the inclusion of dating violence in the violence against women act i hope we can begin to recognize that young women are falling prey to violent relationships in their earliest dating experiences if we can send them the message that anger and violence is not a sign of love we may prevent thousands of future battered women and children from living in fear by passing this bill we reauthorize the existing violence against women act programs for another 5 years when it was originally passed in 1994 and some of us remember it because we were very much involved with it congress authorized 1 5 billion today we have more than double the available grants to states we have the stop grants we have grants to reduce violent crimes against women on campus we have grants essential to protecting victims the shelters for battered women and children the national domestic violence hot line which as we know receives 13 000 calls per month in fact more than that and a number of other provisions we have increased grants being made

these provisions in past measures however because language was tucked into this bill at the last minute that would overturn oregons assisted suicide law i have no choice but to vote against it i gave people my word that i would not come back to congress and vote to overturn what they have twice voted for and as much as i strongly support the tax relief and health care language in this legislation i cannot swallow the poison pill provision that would overturn oregons law where i come from a persons word still means something and i intend to keep mine this legislation contains solid small business tax reductions pension reform and help for rural communities for health care improvements i enthusiastically support these items and was fully prepared to vote for them as a small business owner and having served five years on a community hospital board i understand the problems facing our communities and believe these provisions would be of great benefit to them but to vote for them would mean i would also vote in a way that was against what i had promised thats something i just cannot and will not do the provision to overturn oregons law only came to light shortly before the

united states are crying out for their right to join unions is this america it is a sad day when we have to draw attention to the importance of the freedom to organize in a society like ours one of those 7 days in june will be this friday the day in the district of columbia where members of the region will sit and hear testimony from union members in this region about the difficulties they have had in joining unions and forming unions in this region i know something about this area i continue to be a tenured professor of law at georgetown university law center when i was fulltime one of the major courses that i taught was labor law and i saw and read and studied the deterioration of workers rights of the right to strike i saw the contrasts between a period of great prosperity in american life when business understood that part of the symmetry of the workplace was the right to organize we have come to a point instead where there is no longer talk about occasional unionbusting but workers meet wholesale resistance to the development of unions in the workplace whereby most employers confronted with workers who want to join unions develop strategies to keep unions from even getting a vote on whether workers want a union in fact show me a society where the right to organize is in danger and i will show members a society without full democracy what has our society come to wall street is bursting at the seams we have had surpluses for years on end we have the best economy of the century and we do not want workers to organize to get a fair share of that economy we are sending people out off the welfare rolls as well we should and we do not want them to be organized so they can get a fair share so they can in fact support their families as they leave welfare what have employers to fear after all unions have to win a vote the way we have to win a vote in order to come back to this house every 2 years that is hard to do with todays demographics where workers are by no means automatically oriented towards unions why then do half of the employers threaten to shut down if their workers organize why do they fire one in four workers who in fact organize despite these extraordinary efforts unions are now having remarkable success they are winning half of their elections of 500 or more unions minority and female workers in particular fare much better when they

in the african methodist episcopal church in cincinnati just a few days ago she is the first woman to achieve this high goal and she is certainly very deserving bishop vashti mckenzie whose church is within one block of my house in the 7th congressional district of maryland for many many years has labored in the vineyards of lifting up people pastoring the payne memorial a m e church and being a wonderful wonderful pastor a wonderful wife and one who has constantly been about the business of empowering not only her church members but her community bishop mckenzie is a member of the delta sigma theta sorority and she has been a very active member and she has constantly done things within the 7th congressional district to address the question of how to empower people she recently spent a tremendous amount of time working with the banks in baltimore trying to make sure that they were not redlining she spent a tremendous amount of effort pulling together banks and making sure that their lending practices were consistent throughout the entire baltimore metropolitan area but more important than that even when she was not even considering running for the position of bishop she constantly worked in the vineyards i have often said that when one is unknown unseen unappreciated and unapplauded it is what they do in those moments that really count so i take a moment not only to salute bishop vashti mckenzie but i also take a moment to salute the african methodist episcopal church there are so many churches that do not even want women to be pastors and here is a church that not only have many pastors throughout these united states but has decided to elevate one of its daughters to be a bishop it is with great honor that i recognize and thank bishop vashti mckenzie for
