unitedstates government to the polish peoples republic unless poland has been declared to be in default of its debt or the president certifies to congress that such payment is in the national security interests of the united states i vigorously support this provision for three crucial reasons first the reagan administration has scuttled the ccc regulations pertaining to declarations of default prior to the ccc assuming the debt owed to our commercial banks poland should be declared in default the white house claims that this policy was adopted to forestall a declaration of polish default thereby preventing the disruption of a wider eastwest economic conflict at a minimum the president then should be required to inform the speaker of the house and the president of the senate as to the details and specific reasons why it is in the national security of our country to warrant payments to unitedstates banks by the unitedstates government to cover outstanding polish debts second default is inevitable presently the polish government de facto is in default because of its failure to meet its scheduled payments on the principal and interest owed several commercial banks in order for poland just to keep current in its payments the total new credits extended to poland would have to amount to between 15 and 20 billion in the next 2 or 3 years how can we encourage additional credit for the government of poland when the polish people for more than 6 months now have suffered immeasurably under general jaruszelskis martial law regime a declaration of default is also necessary for the unitedstates banks to legally receive the interest that is due them as declared in section 1493 of the ccc export credit guarantee program gsm102 in order to accure interest on payments due but unpaid a notice of default is to be promptly filed with the ccc apparently our commercial banks realize this and they are awaiting the probable default the ccc offer of january 28 1982 has been extended several times and only one unitedstates bankthe bank of boston international in new yorkhas accepted payment from the ccc and that for only 154 000 third we cannot justify to the american taxpayer spending millions of federal dollars without a candid presidential explanation this is true especially at a time when the fiscal year 1982 deficit is climbing well beyond 100 billion and similar record deficits are certain to follow next year and beyond furthermore our country looks foolish when our leaders pressure our friends in western europe and japan to reduce their trade and to curtail the credit they extend to the soviet union and the other eastern bloc countries when we are continuing to underwrite the bad debts of the polish government no wonder the american people and our allies are confused and skeptical with the adoption of this provision the congress will show the american people that we are ready to inject some commonsense in the conduct of our foreign policy and not to merely follow as sheep the kremlins ploy of playing one western country off against another former secretary of state henry kissinger has put in perspective the polish debts lenins legendary dictum that capitalists would compete to buy the rope with which they would be hanged is coming true and with a vengencefor lenin never guessed that western governments would provide the money to buy the rope and subsidize the price to facilitate the purchase it is the soviet union that must assume financial responsibility for the continuance of martial law in poland approval of this

of foreign aid it is said that december 1981 the united states has a moral commitment to help those in the world suffering from the ravages of famine or drought that the united states acts in its own security interests by aidingeconomically or militarilycertain countries that the united states promotes international economic stability by providing economic assistance to developing countries these are al laudable goals unfortunately these omnibus foreign aid bills rarely implement them and often hinder them a vote against the foreign aid bill is not a vote against mercy i do not think there is one person here who is against the alleviation of innocent human suffering in september 1979 shortly after the caribbean was hit by a terrific hurricane i joined a majority of my colleagues in voting to send 25 million in disaster relief to those countries affected several weeks later i again joined the majority of this house in passing a bill to provide over 200 million that year for the feeding

support an ideal environment for cholera smallpox tuberculosis and malaria if the death rate is appallingly high the human birth rate is even more astonishing young and old work in the fields to bring forth more life but the people who grow the food are themselves malnourished the american cargo ships brimming with abundance have not relieved the misery of the masses a discouraging 80 percent of the populace still doesnt have enough to eat i sent my associate peter grant to bangladesh to find out why it didnt take him long to discover the main problem he noticed it as he was crossing the border in fact the bangladesh customs office looked like the twodollar window at a racetrack there was so much money changing hands grant reported unfortunately the customs office is not the most corrupt government agency that dubious honor goes to the food ministry which handles all the donated grain from overseas like the topsyturvy government agencies of george orwells 1984 the food ministry prevents food from reaching the nations neediest it does this through mismanagement and favortherich policies good weather and western shipments have combined to fill the granaries of bangladesh but its unlikely the oppressed poor will be eating much of that grain heres why most foreign grain donations go into the governments rationing system which grossly favors the welltodo members of society top priority is given to the armed services government employos police bank employes and other privileged categories next come the city dwellers at the bottom of the heap is the rural population who live in the most abject poverty the peasants are fed only if theres anything left over corruption is so widespread and accepted that the government automatically allows for it with a 5 percent loss factor figured into all grain transactions needless to say no transaction is made with less than the permitted 5 percent loss many government warehouse operators have grown fat on kickbacks drought is currently threatening bangladeshs most important rice harvest which means the food in warehouses is the only hedge against disaster yet western experts say that as much as 20 percent of the 1 4 million tons of stored grain may be damaged and 10 percent unusable grain is stored outside under plastic sheets though nearby warehouses have plenty of space to get rid of spoiling

available resources in the credit market that would be taken by the federal government under the bipartisan plan as opposed to current law as i understand it in current law if current practices continue over the next 3 years the size of that credit pool that would be taken by the federal government would be 45 50 65 and 70 percent in some cases but with our budget with a reasonable reduction in deficits and a reasonable restraint in spending with increased military preparation by eliminating waste in that department after those things are put in place the federal government will only sobk up about 15 percent of the available credit i wonder what will happen to interest rates over those 3 years if for the first time in a decade we lower the amount of credit funds soaked up by the

understand the reason for such budget reductions each year by the executive branch the value of the program to the resource base of the nation and the tremendous amount of valuable and essential

pleased to say that the senate accepted with a few exceptions the house version of the legislation this is a tribute to the efforts of my distinguished colleagues chairman zablocki mr broomfield mr hamilton i am also honored to have played a role in putting this legislation together as i stated when the house considered the legislation to authorize unitedstates participation in the multinational peacekeeping force i support this legislation because it will help egypt and israel to fulfill commitments in their treaty of peace israel is to withdraw from the sinai in april 1982 and egypt resume its full sovereignty over the sinai which however is to be largely demilitarized this is essential to consolidate the achievements already reached in the peace process and to encourage further progress toward a full and comprehensive peace in the middle east there is however both tragedy and irony in the fact that as we authorize this unitedstates peacekeeping role in the sinai israel has taken steps to undermine the peace process only a few days ago at the instigation of prime minister begin the israeli knesset voted to extend israeli law to the golan heights this act is tantamount to israeli annexation of the golan heights such a step is dangerous and deplorable it indicates that israel is willing to contravene international law and to renege on its commitment to u n security council resolution 242 this resolution which is the basis for peace and peace talks in the middle east calls for negotiations on the basis of territorial withdrawal and security and recognition if israeli unilaterally moves to foreclose all negotiations on the golan heights then recognition of israel will continue to be withheld and israeli security will be impossible to attain i am also chagrined and deeply disturbed that at the very time the united states is involved in efforts to help israel and egypt reach an agreement on palestinian autonomy in the west bank and gaza israel without any prior notice or consultations with the united states has taken this step to annex the golan heights this act is directly contrary to the mutual cooperation and coordination of effort between the united states and israel that will be necessary if further progress toward peace in the middle east is to be achieved i hope therefore that other voices will join mine in calling upon israel to rescind its action in the golan heights and to renew its commitment to negotiate a solution to the middle east conflict rather than resorting to force this is particularly important as we vote to send american men into this turbulent region"], [0.23815420269966125, 0.26184579730033875, 0, "as one of the members on my side of the aisle who supported this bill in committee i rise to announce that i am not supporting the bill on the floor now one of the problems i think that occurred in the full committee was that some of us who were not on the subcommittee were required to make some decisions without the benefit of the full facts merely because we had not had the time to research this issue enough as one of those who does believe that we should make an effort for those people in our society who are poor to have access to the courts i had to make a decision in my own mind whether the good outweighed the bad or vice versa with respect to legal services corporation when you go back and review the history of this organization you see that time and time again the same complaints have been made with respect to the abuses of this program yet every year congress puts in new limitations and every year those new limitations are of no real import i speak about questions of lobbying i do not know when i have been lobbied more by people involved with any government agency than i have been on this particular bill we have something in the present law which suggests that legal services people are not supposed to lobby yet every member of congress has probably been lobbied by someone who is supported by the current legal services corporation some people say that there is not very much of a percentage of the money of the legal services corporation which goes toward impact litigation or lobbying yet one can look up the figures and say that by at least one determination at least 35 percent of all the money going into legal services corporation is going to what they refer to as impact legislation or impact work what is that i had a minority member union representative employed in my district come to me sometime ago and mention the fact that his elderly mother who needed to have a will drawn had gone twice to the legal services corporation affiliate in my district to request their help she was told on both occasions that they did not have the time to do it because hers was not a class action it took two phone calls by my predecessor in office a congressman to get them to even be concerned about that in my district we happened to be going through a revitalization of the downtown area of one of my major cities that city had spent 100 000 to make sure that every person living in a dilapidated hotel which was scheduled for demolition had another place to live they gave them money to live from 3 to 5 years and yet the legal services corporation affiliate in my district came in and sought an injunction against the city they held up construction work on a downtown area that has become pervasive with criminals where a livable environment had long ago been destroyed where senior citizens cannot walk without fear yet somehow this legal action was supposed to give them some suppor the people need to find out what the thrust of many of the legal services corporations efforts are we ought to look at the statements made at the legislative advocacy meeting for legal services workers held in san juan recently and find out where the real efforts are being made in the name of helping people they are not helping the poor they are helping themselves and their own political aims in many cases"], [0.24590057134628296, 0.25409942865371704, 0, "i rise in support of the fuqua amiendment to the weber amendment as i noted in the additional views i placed with the report accompanying the national science foundation authorization bill h r 1520 i am greatly concerned about adequate funding for a number of important nsf programs these include the science and engineering education economics and behavioral sciences and the international programs these areas are extremely important to provide the necessary trained manpower for our engineering and scientific needs in addition they give us a better understanding of the means to utilize and bring technology into the mainstream of commerce both nationally and internationally while i am generally supportive of the presidents overall budget levels in other areas of science there is not sufficient flexibility in the requested nsf budget to allow enough resources to be devoted to
