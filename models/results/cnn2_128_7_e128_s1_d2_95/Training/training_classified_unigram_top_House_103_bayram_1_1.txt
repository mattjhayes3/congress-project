camp david commitments to israel and egypt and has made it very clear in this bill that it expects the administration to disperse these funds as it has in the past israel is the united states most important ally in the middle east more importantly it is a haven for refugees from the former soviet union and ethiopia where they have been persecuted both officially and unofficially for hundreds of years the funding that the united states provides to israel helps it maintain its qualitative military edge in a region where all but one of its neighbors refuse to recognize its right to exist it also assists the israelis in assimilating the huge number of new arrivals and provide decent housing and economic opportunity for them i am very pleased that the foreign operations subcommittee has included these funds and that the foreign affairs committee showed clear support for israel by earmarking them this bill also makes a strong statement about the importance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral voluntary family planning programs h r 2295 contains 392 million for the aid population program and 50 million for the united nations population fund rapid population growth is one of the most pressing problems facing the world poverty environmental degradation malnutrition and infant and child mortality caused by improperly spaced births are all direct results of the lack of adequate global access to voluntary family planning services in addition as prof paul kennedy clearly lays out in his latest book rapid population growth that is not accompanied by economic growth is a politically destabilizing force the highest growth rates in the world today are in the arab states of the middle east world population is presently increasing by 1 billion people every 11 years the human misery and irreversible environmental problems caused by population growth will only increase without action this bill addresses this urgent need and makes substantial increases in funding for population programs the bill also forcefully addresses the pressing problem of global environmental degradation with a central focus on promoting sustainable development as the report to accompany the bill makes clear economic growth must be predicated on sustainable use of resources rather than their exploitation funding is provided for an appropriately structured global environmental facility which is designed to assist developing countries pursue projects with global environmental benefits focusing on four areas first global warming second biological diversity third pollution of

develop recommendations for modernizing the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of 1974 however due to a delay in funding for the commission the commission has just now gotten started and will need this extension in order to complete its mandate the provision also requires an interim report by the commission by march 1 1994 so that we may consider any recommendations they may have during our authorization hearings next year the second provision extends to september 30 1994 a cooperative agree ment between the department of hud and the veterans administration which requires the department of hud to consider the vas certificate of reasonable value on one or more properties in a housing subdivision this provision helps to streamline the effort of home builders to receive assurances that their properties can be financed with va and fhaguaranteed mortgages in the past fha and va have enjoyed a reciprocal agreement in approving new home new subdivision mortgages fha has accepted va certificates of reasonable value and the va has accepted hud conditional cornnitments this provision would extend that cooperation the third and fourth provisions would increase the commitment authority of the fha to insure mortgages in fiscal year 1993 and increases the commitment authority of ginnie mae to guarantee mortgage backed securities these increases in authority are needed due to a higher degree of mortgage activity in 1993 due to lower interest rates the reductions in the fha single family mortgage insurance premium and the increase in allowable mortgage loan limits authorized last year this is a clear indication of our success in promoting homeownership through the fha program"], [0.8545910120010376, 0.1454089879989624, 1, "i would like to read into

decades of bias in this country in favor of porkbarrel spending i think it is high time that the bias should be against porkbarrel spending the sad fact is that it is so easy to load up a bill with pork it is relatively easy to get majority support but it is hard to load it up so high that it can get supermajority support our president needs the power to root out pork he needs the power to stop

background on interim payments is helpful to better understand my amendment under current law individuals who file for black lung benefits can receive interim benefit payments that is total disability

if the medical evidence shows that the miner has black lung disease and is completely unable to perform his or her customary coal mine work as a result of the disease note you can still be totally disabled and be able to otherwise support yourself total disability under this act does not mean total disability it means total disability insofar as doing work in the mines a reduction of 40 percent from the expected normal respiratory function is regarded as totally disabling for coal mine workers in the absence of evidence to the contrary interim benefits are then paid to the claimant and this is important with a clear understanding that they will have to be repaid if the claimant loses his case in other words claim denied these interim benefits again total disability benefits have always been paid to the claimant with the understanding that they will have to be repaid if the claimant is ultimately found to be ineligible for the benefits section 2 of this bill would eliminate this

repay these funds i happen to be one that thinks that they should get these interim benefits but they should get them after they win then they relate back which is the law by the way in other words

made to it as a reimbursement of benefits paid on a claim which was ultimately denied claimants do by the way repay interim benefits paid to them if their claim is ultimately denied but section 2 b

that the house accepts it the amendment in the nature of a substitute that i am offering to s 423 the amendment represents the fruits of countless hours of discussions and negotiations between house and senate staff it is important legislation that would at long last bring regulation to the most underregulated part of the securities industry investment advisers currently inhabit a wild west of poorly funded regulation where nearly 30 years can elapse before an adviser is ever subjected to a routine inspection by the securities and exchange commission nearly anyone including convicted murderers and drug dealerscan become investment advisers by simply paying a 150 entrance fee that leaves the millions of people who each year entrust their futures to investment advisers at the mercy of an industry that while the majority of its members are honest and above reproach nevertheless harbors many who regard investors as sheep to be shorn and the most common way that investors are fleeced is through productdriven salespeople who get fat commissions from customers who mistakenly believe that their adviser is acting in their best interest since 1981 the number of investment advisers has increased from 5 100 to 22 000 and assets under their management soared from 450 million to 9 3 trillion that is four times the amount deposited today in unitedstates commercial banks at the same time as this explosive growth sec staff assigned to inspect these advisers has increased by only 15 inspectorsfrom 36 to 51 unfortunately those who are forced to depend on the kindness of strangers are almost entirely without the protection of the sec the securities cops on the beat both the sec and the gao have in fact concluded that investment adviser registration gives investors a false sense of cornfort and if regulation is not increased investors would actually be better off with no registration of advisers at all in other words when your police force is massively outmanned and outgunned you may be better off not even pretending that you have one that is a sad commentary on the woeful state of affairs in an industry that touches nearly every household in this country the amendment we are offering up today would justify investors faith in sec registration and regulation it would add more cops to the beat and equip them with better weapons against fraudulent conduct it would also arm investors with information so that they can better protect themselves it is tough legislation that is nonetheless carefully crafted to avoid being burdensome to those advisers that are respectful of the law and their obligations to their clients to help address these problems this amendment which contains consensus language supported by a bipartisan group of colleagues in the house and senate would provide the sec with the annual funds it needs in order to inspect investment advisers more thoroughly and more frequently than they are able to do with the limited resources they have now it would also provide enhanced protection for investors by establishing a mechanism for the identification of unregistered advisers by allowing the sec to designate a selfregulatory organization to conduct periodic examinations of certain advisers by improving disclosures of conflicts of interest and other pertinent information by authorizing the sec to require fidelity bonds of certain advisers by making provision for the establishment of a readily accessible telephonic or other electronic process for finding out about the disciplinary history of advisers and by mandating prominent upfront disclosure of the convictions of advisers that have been or that employ persons that have been convicted of felonies last year the house passed h r 578 the investment adviser regulatory enhancement and disclosure act the original house billfrom which many of the provisions and concepts contained in the present amendment derive the original house bill and the original senate bill differed in numerous ways and the present vehicle represents our successful at tempt to bridge those differences without losing the focus of the origina house bill thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the chief sponsor of the original house bill representative boucher to the persistence of chairman dingell and to the bipartisan cooperation and assistance of representatives moorhead and fields we have been able to arrive at a solid solution to the regulatory and other deficiencies in the investment adviser sector and to address the concerns of our colleagues in the senate to the extent that the amendment contains provisions that are substantially similar to provisions contained in the original house bill the language of the house report accompanying h r 578 the house report that describes those provisions shall continue to obtain the purpose of my statement at this time is to explain and interpret changes between the original house bill and the language we are voting on today the sec staff is comprised of hardworking committed men and women who but for resources would be able to clean up many of the outstanding compliance problems in the industry in section 2 this amendment provides for the collection of new fees that will be used to fund an enhanced program of inspections but more money will not without properly targeted use improve regulation in part because even with the estimated 16 million annual increase in funding the sec will still have to perform regulatory triage and inspect the riskiest advisers first and most frequently it is therefore critical that the sec work to develop an inspection protocol that relies on an analysis of relative risk it im clear that certain characteristics increase either the risk that an adviser is engaging in improper conduct or the temptation for an adviser to do so for example an adviser with custody of or broad discretion over funds has easier access to a clients assets the receipt of commissions for the sale of investments recommended to a client likewise increases the risk that an advisers recommendations may conflict with his fiduciary duties to his client in addition we expect that the sec in designing its inspection schedule and in developing a set of riskbased criteria for inspections will take into account the conclusions and recommendations of the general accounting office gao the gao both in a 1990 report and in 1992 testimony before the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance argued forcefully that examinations of new registrants be conducted within a reasonable period of time following registration it also made a compeling case for the sec reinspecting advisers found to have deficiencies rather than relying on the word of the adviserwhose word under the circumstances should be treated with skep ticism that any such defects havebeen corrected even a history of past deficiencies can represent in itself a risk factor for broader improprieties in the notorious case described at length in the house report of steven wymer the california investment adviser who bilked numerous cities and towns out of millions of dollars the sec conducted focused cause inspections in several instances before the fraud in which he had engaged came to light section 3 of the amendment provides for the conduct by the sec of surveys of unregistared investment advisers this section is identical in its substance to that contained in the original house bill and its purpose and interpretation remain unchanged section 4 of the amendment authorizes the sec to designate an sro to conduct inspections of certain advisers this section is identical in its substance to that contained in the original house bill and its purpose and interpretation like that of section 3 remain unchanged among the changes to the original house bill that house members agreed to in developing this consensus amendment was the deletion of a provision that would have expressly prohibited advisers from making unsuitablerecommendations as well as a requirement to make a reasonable inquiry about the financial circumstances of a client the provision also included a recordkeeping requirement designed to assist the sec in its inspections in auditing for adherence to the suitability rule the suitability provision contained in the house bill did not represent a new substantive requirement but instead restated an existing requirement thatis implicit in the antifraud provisions of the advisers act as a result of the inclusion of this provision in the house bill the sec on its own initiative and because it has ample statutory authority to do so embarked upon a rulemaldng proceeding designed to codify in the same way as the house bill the extant suitability requirement and to establish a recordkeeping requirement similar to that contained in the original house bill to date the sec has proceeded apace with this rulemaking and we expect that it will adopt a final rule comparable in text and interpretation to that contained in the house bill shortly among the most impo tant subjects of this bill is disclosure the brevity of the provision set forth in section 5 relative to the more detailed provisions of the original house bill should not be interpreted as a lessened commitment to disclosure and the critical role it plays in equipping investors with the tools needed to protect themselves from the outset of our efforts to ensure that the more rapecious elements of the investment adviser industry are not allowed to take advantage of investors we saw conflicts of interest as perhaps the biggest obstacle advisers who receive commissions on the products they recommend fees such as those paid by product sponsors or packagers in exchange for the sale of a unit of their product or credits toward noncash compensation such as trips or research have an interest in remuneration which conflicts with the interest of their client in receiving objective disinterested advice the magnitude ofthe conflict varies according to the extent or magnitude of the remuneration in question if the remuneration is negligible the conflict may be so minor as to be functionally nonexistent if however it is not and it may have an impact on the kind of advice rendered by the adviser it is material the nature and extent or amount ofa commission or fee or the value of a particular prize thus has a cr rect bearing on whether such conflict is material a material conflict of interest conflicts with among other things the clients interest in recbiving suitable investment advice avoiding unnecessary or excessive transaction charges and making informed investment decisions accordingly section 5 of the amendment requires the sec within one year from the date of enactment to examine the nature of the conflicts of interest with an advisers fiduciary duties that may arise when an investment adviser is compensated on the basis of commissions or fees from the sale of investment products to clients or receives credits toward noncash compensation thus the sec must study all conflicts related to the receipt by an adviser of commissions fees or other items of value paid in exchange for or as a result of the sale of investment products to clients on the basis of this examination the sec must prescribe any rules that may be necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes of the title to require that the existence and extent of any material conflicts of interest be fully disclosed based upon the extensive hearing record in tie house compelling studies conducted by various groups such as the consumer federation of america the american association of retired persons and the north american securities administrators association and based upon numerous media exposes it is clear even before detailed sec examination that grave deficiencies in current forms of disclosure exist the house report to accompany h r 578 cities examples of the kinds of dieclosure problems that have plagued the idu etry some of the deficiencies in disclosure can and will be remedied in the secs revisions to the form required for the registration of investment advisers form adv part of which constitutes the brochure which is given to customers and prospective customers of an investment adviser other deficiencies such aswhen clients are kept in the dark about the extent or magnitude of a conflict of interestfor example the size of a commission until after they make a purchase will have to be addressed through sec rulemaking full disclosure as called for by this provision would entail disclosure sufficient to permit a client to make an informed investment decision a decision that does not subject him or her to unnecessary or excessive transaction charges and a decision that is not influenced without his or her knowledge of such influence by the payment or promise of payment of prizes or other forms of noncash remuneration to the recommending adviser useful and relevant information is the touchstone of disclosure with respect to conflicts of interest it is also critical with respect to pertinent information about an advisers background some background information is provided in the form adv distributed to clients other important information specifically information pertaining to an advisers disciplinary historyis not currently accessible to the average customer this bill therefore requires that the entity designated by the sec to create and operate a filing depository establish and maintain a readily accessible telephonic or other electronic process designed to provide such information this electronic system would receive inquiries regarding the disciplinary and other information involving investment advisers and persons associated with investment advisers key to this provision are the twin concepts of ready access and low cost investors should be encouraged to find out about an advisers disciplinary history not discouraged through systems that are either difficult to use costly or not extensively available taking advantage of emerging technologies and online services is useful but those should not be the exclusive means of obtaining such information unless all or virtually all households have ready access to them accessibility also has a cost component many of those most in need of protection suchas older investors might be discouraged from making inquiry if they have to pay for the privilege making the system provider assume all reasonable costs associated with providing that service is therefore an important element of this provision the system provider should establish a system for which the costs are unreasonable similarly individual investors could not be charged a fee for obtaining written information responding to their inquiry although other service users could be charged a reasonable fee because this provision is analogous to a similar provision in the penny stock reform act it is anticipated that it will be set up similarly and contain similar sorts of information as the system available with respect to registered brokerdealers specifically it is expected that the tollfree telephone access investors are givenrthrough the nasd hotline with respect to brokerdealers will be replicated for investment advisers we see no reason to discriminate between these two types of securities professionals either on the basis of the type of information available about them or on the basis of the cost or means of obtaining such information indeed the market distortion that could occur if there were disparate systems containing dissimilar kinds of information and available at a different cost would cause confusion to investors as in the brokerdealer context the system could also include other information such as bankruptcy history in addition to information about disciplinary history section 6 of the amendment also requires the sec to include in each of the first three annual reports submitted after the date of enactment a statement describing the status of the secs proposals for the revision of form adv consultations with state securities and other regulators concerning the coliection and dissemination of information contained on such form and implementation of systems to collect and disseminate such information to enforce compliance with the title in addition those reports must include an analysis ofthe methods by which the revisions f form adv will result in first the timely and effective disclosure to investment adviser clients of material facts concerning the background cornpensation services and practices of the adviser and second the prominent disclosure to such clients of a any conflicts of interest b methods available for securing additional information concerning the adviser and its employees c remedies available with respect to disputes arising out of the advisory relationship and d any conviction of the adviser or any person associated with the adviser within 10 years preceding the filing of any application for registration or at any time thereafter of any crime that is punishable by imprisonment for 1 or more years or of a substantially equivalent crime by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction this provision derives from the brochure provision contained in the original house bill in which the elements of an enhanced brochure were set forth in the statute because the sec is well on its way to revamping form adv it was deemed unnecessary to include that portion of the provision certain important elements of that provision have been retained however so that congress can ensure that they be incorporated in a prominent manner into the brochure distributed to investment advisory clients prominence would require that each of these disclosures must be readily noticeable to the client disclosure of methods available for securing additional information concerning the adviser and its employees would entail setting forth the tollfree number to call and in addition any other supplementary means e g the internet address through which such information is available with respect to disclosure of remedies we do not intend a recitation of all available causes of action but rather a general statement in the brochure that makes clear the existence of remedies under state and federal law where wrongs have been committed against a client by an adviser in the absence of an express private right of action in the advisers act it is especially important to inform clients that they are not without remedies section 7 of the amendment contains a requirement that certain investment advisers obtain a fidelity bond as in the original house bill the fidelity bond would provide a source of funds to make clients who have been defrauded through larceny or embezzlement whole unlike the original house bill however the secs authority in this section of the amendment is permissive rather than mandatory the authority given to the sec would extend to advisers with custody of client funds or securities that have discretionary authority to direct client investments or that advise investment companies paragraph 2 sets forth the considerations the sec must take into account in implementing this section the degree of risk to client assets that is involved the cost and availability of fidelity bonds existing fidelity bonding requirements any alternative means to protect client assets and the results findings and conclusions of a study described in paragraph 3 on the availability of fidelity bonds and the impact of fidelity bonding on the competitive position of smallscale investment advisers finally the sec is given the authority to exempt any person or class of persons from any fidelity bonding requirements under such terms or conditions and for such period as the sec determines in addition the sec is required to exempt any investment adviser from any bonding requirement if the sec determines that fidelity bonds are not readily or reasonably available in the urban or rural areas in which such investment adviser is located or the cost of obtaining a fidelity bond would have a substantial adverse impact on such investment advisers competitive position this provision is not meant to permit an investment adviser that is marginally profitable to claim an exemption because it cannot afford a fidelity bond nor is it intended to permit an investment adviser that is charged a premium for or is refused a fidelity bond because its background business practices or lack of controls suggest a high degree of risk rather we read this provision as requiring the sec to exempt from the bonding requirement any class or group of advisers that for some reason other than normal and customary underwriting considerations is denied a fidelity bond at a reasonable cost deleted from this amendment is the provision in the original house bill requiring the sec to analyze the risks to investors when an investment adviser is made the sole recipient of communications from the custodian or when an investment adviser or affiliate thereof serves as the custodian the purpose of this provision was to address an anomaly that surfaced in the course of hearings held by the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance on the massive fraud perpetrated by steven wymer testimony by wymer made it clear that crucial to his fraudulent scheme was either the witting or unwitting cooperation of custodians in making wymer the sole recipient of all confirmations account statements and other communications concerning client accounts because clients received no independent reports of account activities wymer was able to fabricate falseaccount statements to hide losses unauthorized transactions and defalcation of clients cash and securities because the sec currently has the statutory authority to promulgate rules directly to address this problem it has initiated a rulemaking process designed to address these concerns this provision of the house bill was therefore deleted in anticipation of adoption by the sec of a strong rule that would make it impossible for a comparable fraud to be repeated by the same means the rule would prohibit an investment adviser registered or required to be registered under the advisers act from exercising investment discretion with respect to a client account unless it reasonably believed that the custodian of the account is providing account statements to the client no less frequently than quarterly an adviser would be deemed to have a reasonable belief that the custodian is providing account statements if the adviser has received copies of client account statements indicating that they were sent to clients we applaud the secs initiative in this area and expect to see the rule adopted in final form soon"], [0.0027308762073516846, 0.4972691237926483, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from south carolina and the others who have worked so hard to move this legislation to the
