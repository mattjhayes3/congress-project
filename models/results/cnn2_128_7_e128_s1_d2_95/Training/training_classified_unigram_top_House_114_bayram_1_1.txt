clause in our first amendment this is what it said no man shall suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion religious freedom is a fundamental human right protected by our first amendment it is essential to our free and flourishing society our nation was found in part by individuals seeking refuge from religious persecution from religious discrimination for these pioneers and for all to come after america was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls at its essence the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion it is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week it is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these faiths religious freedom quite simply is about freedom itself this is why the very first part of the very first amendment to our constitution is about religious freedom it is our first and most cherished liberty however our ability to be free to live out the convictions of our faith not only in the public square but also in the privacy of our own homes in our churches in our businesses is in jeopardy right here in our nations capital the misleading name rhnda is nothing more than a legalized

mental health issues women are less likely than men to be employed full time meaning they are less likely to be eligible for employerbased health benefits difficulty finding and maintaining employerbased coverage is especially pronounced for older women who are more likely to develop conditions like breast cancer but thanks to obamacare womens health took a monumental step forward before obamacare insurance companies could discriminate against women denying coverage to womenof course to all peopledue to preexisting conditions such as cancer and even previous pregnancies today being a woman or becoming pregnant is no longer a preexisting condition the national womens law center estimates that insurers practice of gender rating cost women about a billion dollars a year before obamacare obamacare ends gender rating it requires health plans to cover womens preventive services like contraceptive care and ob gyn visits without cost sharing accessible contraceptive coverage is particularly important prior to obamacare more than half of all women between the ages of 18 and 34 struggled to afford it in addition every health insurance plan is now required to offer maternity care prior to the passage of obamacare the national womens law center found that only 12 percent of private plans included maternity services and even without those major improvements health care accessibility remains a challenge almost one out of three women reports not visiting a doctor due to the cost women are still less likely to be insured than men and even when they have insurance women face increasingly high deductibles copayments and other cost sharing requirements forcing major sacrifices just in order to make ends meet a recent study found that over 40 percent of women have unmet medical needs due to the cost of medical care this problem is particularly acute in states that have not expanded medicaid currently 3 million uninsured women live in states that have not expanded

compassion and care nurses display in the practice of their profession registered nurses or rns are the largest segment of the health care workforce with 3 1 million rns and that number is growing rns meet americans health care needs on every level they provide preventive care such as screenings and immunizations they diagnose treat and help to manage chronic illnesses and they help patients make critical health decisions every day but most importantly nurses take the time to care for each patient during a difficult time in their or their familys lives we have plenty of evidence that hiring more nurses leads directly to improved quality care and patient outcomes we have seen study after study showing this connection including a recent analysis showing that one out of every four unanticipated events that leads to death or injury are related to nurse understaffing yet we continue to see nurses understaffed at medical facilities nurses around the country have identified understaffing as the single most important barrier they face in providing quality care to their patients it is also a barrier to quality improvement and efforts to reduce preventable readmissions i have introduced legislation called the safe nurse staffing for patient safety and quality care act which would help solve this serious problem by establishing a federal minimum standard in all hospitals for direct care registered nurse to patient staffing ratios this problem is not confined to hospitals nursing homes are currently required to only have a direct care nurse on staff 8 hours a

committee on homeland security where we are colleagues as well as his work trying to keep our nations security and our airport security at its highest level this bill was a long time coming since i was first elected to congress in 2010 i have worked hard to secure our nations airports the last case i had when i was a district attorney before entering congress was the case of a young 16yearold who had secreted himself on a commercial airliner penetrating the perimeter of the charlottedouglas international airport and undetected stowed himself away in the wheel well tragically he went from north carolina and his body was found in massachusetts in the district i represented as we investigated the cause of that death we found out what the circumstances were that he had penetrated all the security in fact i sent my investigators down from massachusetts to look at that even knowing that this had occurred there was no record videowise or otherwise of what he had done so even looking backwards we couldnt even find out where the security was breached until we made the conclusions at the end of our investigation and looked at the perimeter of that airport and how vulnerable that was since that time i have demanded information on areas of perimeter and access security in our airports frankly not satisfied with the progress in addressing these security issues i requested an independent review in 2014 of all airports with a transportation security administration presence released this spring this independent report by the gao found that while tsa has made some progress in assessing risks to airport perimeter and access control security the agency had not taken new or emerging threats into consideration as well as the unique makeup of individual airports the points of access at those individual airports and the unique perimeters surrounding those airports updating the risk to our airports with information that reflects the current threat ensures that the tsa bases its risk management decisions on current information and focuses its limited resources on the highest priority risks to each airport further gao found that tsa has not comprehensively assessed the vulnerability of commercial airports systemwide in fact from 2009 to 2015 tsa conducted these comprehensive assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide or 19 percent and that is cumulatively some years that assessment only occurred in 3 percent of the airports this legislation will make permanent the recommendations from this independent report specifically the bill requires tsa to update transportation security sector risk assessments for the entire aviation sector it requires it to update the comprehensive risk assessment perimeter access control with the most currently available intelligence it requires that it conduct a thorough assessment of airport perimeters and access control points such as the unique geography each individual airport entails and it determines a future strategy of regular updates further the bill incorporates the input of major airport operators which we met with here in d c with the committee on homeland security we heard firsthand their concern of the lack of an individualized security strategy a recent report of the associated press investigation found that intruders breach airport fences approximately every 10 days altogether there were at least 39 breaches nationwide in 2015 which was also the annual average from 2012 to 2015 tsas own calculation over a 10year period ending in 2011 showed 1 300 perimeter breaches in the 450 domestic airports but that figure does not account for continued perimeter security breaches since 2011 including stowaways trespassing across tarmacs scaling of perimeter fences and driving vehicles through barriers across airport property the landscape in which terrorists operate is constantly changing and it is challenging we have to stay ahead of it we have to look no further than the recent attacks in paris brussels and istanbul to see what the threats are within access points and perimeters of airports we were lucky here in the unitedstates that the individuals that breach these access points and perimeters did not have the same nefarious intentions but that doesnt mitigate the risk it doesnt mitigate the fact that these people pose dangerous behavior potentially to our airports to

federal laws that govern the management of the striped bass fishery in the exclusive economic zone or the eez between montauk new york and block island rhode island one of the most pressing issues that is faced by long island fishermen is the urgent need to clarify the federal regulations regarding striped bass fishing in the small area of federally controlled waters between montauk point and block island between new york state waters which end 3 miles off of montauk point and the rhode island boundary which begins 3 miles off of block island there is a small area of federally controlled water that is considered part of the eez the eez which extends up to 200 miles from the coast are waters that are patrolled by the coast guard where the united states has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries and other natural resources since 1990 striped bass fishing has been banned in the eez even though fishermen can currently fish for striped bass in adjacent state waters fishing is an industry in and around my district it is getting more and more difficult to survive in this industry if you are a businessowner fishermen are desperately pleading for commonsense relief and this is one way congress can help to my colleagues in this chamber i ask you to vote in favor of this bill passing this legislation on behalf of the amazing fishermen on the east end of long island long island striped bass fisherman have lost 60 percent of their traditional fishing grounds due to federal restrictions that my bill intends to reform additionally the geography of our region means that making the 15mile journey by boat from montauk point to block island requires passing through a small strip of waters considered to be part of the eez the shift in jurisdiction can mean the difference between a nice day on the water and committing a federal offense my bill h r 3070 clarifies the federal laws currently governing the management of the striped bass fishery between montauk and block island permitting striped bass fishing in these waters and allowing for local regulations to manage this important fishery this legislation is a commonsense reform that offers a simple solution to a unique local issue providing regulatory relief and more certainty to our regions fishermen while restoring local control to a critical fishery that must be properly managed and preserved for future

protecting those borders ukraine dismantled its vast nuclear weapons complex the third largest in the world with that memorandum in hand ukraine did what it promised but what about the other signatories to that agreement today the budapest memorandum appears to be a hollow promise it comes as little surprise that russia would break that promise but it disappoints me to no end that the free world led by the united states of america seems reluctant to honor its promises to take a more effective role as a coalition of nations and civil society organizations to help ukraine stand on its own in the face of internal carnage perpetrated by russia natos supreme allied commander in europe general philip breedlove a man who knows an enormous amount about that continent recently expressed his deep concern that our focus has been pulled away from russias proxy invasion of ukraine folks have taken their eye off of ukraine a little bit because of syria he said according to him the situation is similar to how the world lost focus on the russian invasion of crimea which the united states still considers ukrainian territory after russia invaded eastern ukraine and triggered

perhaps something is owed to those sacrificial people for what they endured and for the spark of liberty that still breathes so strongly in their hearts and minds in marking the brutal tragedy of the

on russias war against ukraine government reforms and financial challenges there is rarely any mention of the extraordinary dimensions of the human suffering caused by moscows aggression while ukraine certainly needs greater military financial and political assistance our focus here must be on the humanitarian aspect as you know according to the un over 5 million people including 1 7 million children are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance 8 000 people have died and over 17 000 have been injured and wounded there are over 1 390 000 displaced people including 174 000 children the challenges of this human tragedy are overwhelming even the most conservative estimates show that over 65 of projected needs have yet to be meteven on the level of pledges as representatives of the

for their lives and for the future of our country while we are grateful for the assistance provided by the united states government to date we know that the need is so much greater thus we appeal to you to increase assistance and to activate the full potential of the national guard state partnership program and the partnership for peace pfp as instruments for alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe one of the stated goals of the pfp is to provide a framework for enhanced political and military cooperation for joint multilateral crisis management activities such as humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping ukraine was the first postsoviet country to join the pfp in 1993 in addition to the assistance provided by the us government we during our travels throughout the united states have come to personally witness the great generosity of the american people expressed through numerous spontaneous initiatives to ship medical and humanitarian supplies to ukraine time is of the essence mr president the people of ukraine need to know that they are not forgotten in their time for need the instruments anticipated by the national guard state partnership and partnership for peace programs will allow the american people to more effectively and rapidly access and deliver already available medical and humanitarian supplies to ukraine literally within days we each represent

triclosan but they dont know how to avoid them it seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health and something needs to change the energy and

1976 without any safety review other flaws came to light only through litigation like the impossible analytical burden of the statutes least burdensome clause even though we have recognized these flaws forward progress has been elusive when chairman shimkus and chairman upton approached ranking member tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform i was hopeful the result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to epa action and give the agency new authority and new resources it will offer more protection and more implementation than current law it is a strong compromise and i urge all of my colleagues to support it h r 2576 will empower epa to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that epa impose the least burdensome regulatory option and by establishing a riskbased standard for risk management instead of a costbenefit standard for the first time the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses h r 2576 will improve epas access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing epa to require testing through orders and consent agreements not just rulemakings and by authorizing epa to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk h r 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals those that are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic under this bill we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies h r 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children workers the elderly and hotspot communities the bill will provide more resources for epa to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees it would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for tsca implementation under the bill all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency h r 2576 would ensure that states maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation under the bill preemption of state laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals no state law would be preempted until federal requirements are in effect many state laws would be protected from preemption including existing state laws new state laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other federal laws state tort claims and state laws regulating uses not evaluated by epa in response to concerns raised by stakeholders and members a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup and i thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes there is now clear authority for epa to set a schedule if manufacturerrequested risk evaluations exceed epas capacity ensuring that such requests wont overwhelm the program the grandfathering provision for existing state laws has also been clarified based on feedback from state attorneys general strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management the preservation of state monitoring and reporting requirements and the expansion of epas testing authority i know that tomorrow we will get

and damaged by the illadvised adventure in iraq now we are embarking upon without doing the tough decisionmaking about setting priorities we are launching down a road here that would allow us to bypass the budgetary process and make appropriate tradeoffs whether it is within the department of defense overall but i would argue that it ought to be within the navy budget my amendment wouldnt stop going forward the money involved would go into submarine construction but it would inject a little bit of discipline here now this doesnt tell us where the money is going to come from for the project and their account this sleight of hand doesnt make it easier to finance but it makes it harder to track and it eliminates the discipline as i say by forcing the navy and then the pentagon to be able to deal with it openly honestly and know where we are at there is no reason to go down this path i hope some day we have a spirited debate on the floor of the house about how much deterrence is enough are the pentagon experts right that we can reduce it or do we need to go down a path spending 1 trillion over the course of the next 30 years the truth is we are going to have to face some very difficult budgetary decisions this proposal doesnt help us do that it helps us to evade it i urge adoption of the amendment i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0032156705856323242,

myself such time as i may consume i think one of the big problems with washington is that everyone finds excuses not to do the right thing the truth is we need research and development here in america not overseas we need the jobs that come with that here in america not overseas we need frankly the future of america here rather than overseas republicans and democrats both agree on that both sincerely agree on that today we heard excuses and we will hear excuses we are told this doesnt fund infrastructure it doesnt this is about funding the infrastructure of research and development and innovation but not through the government this is through our entrepreneurs like apple and microsoft and all the new research and groundbreaking drugs and medical breakthroughs that is how we are funding the infrastructure of our future roads and bridges we will tackle in another bill we are told this isnt comprehensive tax reform no it is not it is a critical step forward in that by taking a provision that has been temporary far too long and making it a permanent part of our tax code so that we can invest in r d with certainty so we can have honest scorekeeping in our budget and so we can take that first step toward real comprehensive progrowth tax reform we are told today as we have heard in the past that it is not paid for but in fact to the extensions since 1981 these provisions havent been paid for our democrat friends passed these bills and supported them they werent paid for we have done the same it was 1 year or 2 years at a time to say this is fiscally irresponsible when they voted so many times to do the same thing seems to me to be another excuse the cost of doing this permanently is no more than the cost of doing it 1 or 2 years at a time to think otherwise is sort of in the line of saying you know that dessert doesnt have calories if i eat it standing up well the cost of r d is the same but the cost of not making it permanent is very much not the same we know the impact will be fewer jobs here in america more r d in china and we will lose our lead in the world as the worlds innovator no more excuseswhat we are looking for today is a bipartisan effort to make sure those jobs are here in america that our companies have a chance to invest more and more and more each year that is what we want them to do we want to give college graduates hope as the majority leader from california noted 4 out of 10 college graduates either cant find jobs or they are working behind a cash register well it is wrong we ought to give them an opportunity we ought to give them some jobs and some hope those college graduates are skilled and talented and they deserve to be part of americas innovative society that is what they deserve that is what we are going to deliver to them while i am thrilled my democrat friends are talking about the deficit i wish they would have acted upon it earlier the first year they took control of this house under the former speaker they doubled the deficit the second year they tripled the deficit the third year they took it over a trillion dollars and a trillion dollars again until the american public said enough what we got for all that spending was the worst economic recovery in half a century we are missing 6 million jobs from the american economy we have fewer people working the workforce than we did before the recovery actually began in some ways we are going backwards especially for our young people today with this bill this is research and development both parties support the only reason we are hearing the excuses is that it is a republican bill this time that is the only reason research and development is not a republican proposal it is not a democrat proposal it is an american proposal we all support we think our economy ought to grow not in washington but back home and that innovation matters the way we do that is to recapture americas leadership in r d for all those reasonsand for the support of entrepreneurs manufacturers and technology companies back home all across americai urge that we stop the excuses we join together as republicans and democrats we take back americas leadership in innovation and create the jobs that our young people deserve i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
