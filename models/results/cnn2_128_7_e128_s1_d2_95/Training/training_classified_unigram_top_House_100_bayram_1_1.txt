done and i would say to those who come to this well and repeatedly make that statement and claim that the intelligence committee has made that finding that the intelligence committee has not made that finding i support the young amendment because it restores not just symmetry but because it restores commonsense to this debate we have seen in the last year regrettably tragically and shamefully the partisan polarization of american foreign policy under previous presidents the general agreement the understanding shared by all responsible people in public life was that in matters of foreign policy issues should not be drawn along partisan lines or as political issues and when a confrontation was ordered with the soviets over their missiles in cuba or an embargo imposed on the soviets after their invasion of afghanistan both under democratic presidents there was the usual concern and questioning on both sides of the aisle but there was no attempt to turn foreign policy into a forum for partisan division and people who have stood before me here in the well have talked about do not be confused folks there are no democrats supporting this and i would not brag about that if i were you

selected by a duly elected constituent assembly and with presidential elections scheduled soon and nicaragua with a president who seized power at the point of a gun el salvador guilty of violations of human rights and nicaragua guilty of far more violations of human rights el salvador with a free press and nicaragua with no free press el salvador with an active private business sector and nicaragua with very limited free enterprise el salvador imperfect flawed guilty of some very real failings by our standards and nicaragua a closed society without freedom exporting war and violence and death

have this opportunity to add my comments about this great american general marshall is truly one of our nations greatest heroessoldier diplomat statesman the first professional soldier ever to be awarded a nobel peace prize he was both a man of vision and a master of organizational detail from his early rise to military prominence as chief of military operations of the first army during world war i through his years as assistant commandant in charge of instruction at fort benning ga where he was able to institute many changes in instruction which were valuable to subsequent military organization during world war ii and on to his supreme achievements as chief of staff and secretary of state he saw clearly the needs and problems at hand and worked with exceptional clarity to accomplish goals which to most of us would have been unattainable as we contemplate general marshalls many accomplishments and particularly the unparalleled success of the marshall plan in bringing about economic recovery in postwar europe there are many lessons which we can consider as we seek to guide our country wisely general marshall was not afraid to propose bold solutions he was not afraid to challenge accepted wisdom or to fight against special interests at the same time general marshall was aware of the need to prepare carefully and to educate others as to the validity of the course of action he was preparing the marshall plan which was proposed on june 5 1947 was at that time the product of months of consideration of the problems facing europe and concern over the consequences of the united states failure to act during the months that followed studies were undertaken to determine whether and how the united states could support an aid program of the magnitude anticipated and secretary marshall and others in the administration were busy with activities to inform both members of congress and the public about the need to provide assistance to europe nearly 11 months of careful effort elapsed before a wellinformed congress strongly endorsed the economic cooperation act of 1948 the largest foreign aid program in our nations history finally general marshall thoroughly understood the need for bipartisan cooperation to achieve the ends he sought he and senator vandenberg work6d closely together to support passage of the act the administrator of eca paul hoffman was a successful republican businessman who made every effort to run the huge program above partisan political considerations general marshall represented the best of american values i echo

to proceed with any prosecution the same logic that leads us to the conclusion that this is bad legislation as it is applied to the congress is equally applicable returning to my initial point it is time to strip all the veneer off of this argument and focus at the reality of what we are dealing with here we are not talking about conflicts of interest or about public perception public confidence because if we are this body ought to be arguing in favor of this amendment because if there is a shaking of public confidence it exists when members of this body are brought before the committee on standards of official conduct and we can list at least eight cases in this congress where that exact situation has occurred and individuals have been asked to give restitution one that comes to mind is the gentlewoman from ohio who has admitted that the gentlewoman was paying an individual who was not even on her staff in washington the woman was in new york which is outside of the gentlewomans congressional district she paid 47 000 the point is the committee on standards of official conduct obviously thought it was wrong because they said repay the 47 000 the gentlewoman did repay the 47 000 and no indictment has been forthcoming i suspect that if there is a situation where public confidence is shattered it is that type of situation the point being this is bad law i do not deny it for a moment it is bad law for all of the constitutional flaws equal protection due process the public confidence is not going to be strengthened any by targeting out 59 people we have already established today that there has not been a single conviction of any covered member during the several years going back to 1978 never a single conviction and millions of dollars spent mr walsh has now spent 2 9 million and he has yet to bring forth a single indictment of covered individuals we see all types of arguments here that are being made with straight faces because they apply to members of congress but then they can turn right around and be applied to the statute at large no one makes the same points we simply say well that does not quite apply here because of this inherent conflict what we are

just paid lipservice the point is we are ignoring the most fundamental right the 14th amendment right to equal protection under the law is totally ignored we are in fact passing a bill of attainder

if one accepts an appointment in any administration that necessarily that ought to subject that individual to that special treatment the gentleman from kansas suggests that the flaw here is that members of congress ought not to be elevated to this special position because it would make them more difficult to prosecute if it would why do we want to make it more difficult to prosecute members of the administration i would go back to a point though that i made early on this morning and that is if the members look at the entire history the members will find that we have handled these types of problems very well watergate the greatest constitutional crisis of this countrys history we prosecuted all of the presidents men without having this statute on the books since this statute has been

the first major point to make about the gephardt amendment is that it is not as draconian as has been advertised in this regard let me make five points first a simple trade imbalance would not trigger sanctions under the gephardt amendment clearly unfair trade practices must also be present second this unfair trade must be sustained and systematic not minor or occasional third the finding of unfair trade practices would be made by persons appointed by the president and therefore not be inclined to unnecessarily force the presidents hand fourth no sudden sledgehammer would fall as soon as a country fell afoul of the gephardt amendment the president and his representatives would effectively have 18 months to work out an agreement fifth the president retains the authority to waive gephardt sanctions on the ground of national ecomomic interest and such a waiver could be overridden only by twothirds of the congress only when all these hurdles are past would the president be required to act but the second major point of the gephardt amendment is that it does have teeth the sanctionsif they comewill be real in fact they are so real that in all likelihood they will never actually come

resistance of world war ii i remembered that he had earlier compared them with the american revolutionary founding fathers i recalled how in fact the contra commander and a large majority of the contra military high command are former somozan national guardsmen a fact the state department has admitted i recalled the 18 millionplus of funds given to contras in recent years which are still unaccounted for the confirmed reports of individuals killed and maimed by the contras are fresh in my mind i recalled the numerous contra bombings of hospitals schools and roads using maps and plans provided by the american cia and i recalled the insiders description of the corrupt leadership and questionable objectives of the contras rendered by oliver norths former assistant robert owen i wondered how many of the nicaraguan peasants sympathize with these socalled freedom fighters whose brutal tactics they regularly observe it seems clear why so few volunteer for the contra forces and why after 7 years of struggling the contras control no major area of nicaragua and have to organize and direct forces from across the border in honduras at the same time i pondered the presidents

feature is the effect on their pocketbooks not one additional medical service is offered which is not already provided under medigap provisions or medicaid what this legislation does is effectively eliminate the necessity of filing for medicaid by avoiding the imposition of a means test the catastrophic provisions and especially the addition of outpatient prescription drug benefits would normally overwhelm the ability of the medicare system to remain solvent so naturally we increase taxes not on all people but only on the elderly new supplemental premium rates will increase tax liability by 15 percent in 1989 to 28 percent in 1993 if any senior had a tax liability in 1989 of say 1 000 that persons increase will be 150 if their tax liability was 5 000 that additional tax will be 750 if they had a tax liability of 10 000 their additional tax will be 1 500 this rate by the way of 15 percent by 1989 will increase to 28 percent in 1993 which will significantly increase the amounts of the surtax that i have described as a result the elderly could see a possible increase in their medicare tax of between 30 and 60 percent the maximum increased supplemental liability would be 800 in 1989 850 in 1990 900 in 1991 950 in 1992 and 1 050 in 1993 this is small solace to the tax bite it takes out of the wallets of millions of our elderly when we look at the projections of programs that have been adopted in the past we can only envision the growth of this program that is almost beyond our imagination for example when medicaid was first instituted it was projected that the cost in 1970 would be 2 7 billion the actual costs were 5 billion 85 percent higher similar results are found in medicare where 1970 costs were projected in 1965 to be 4 but ended up being 6 3 or

they concentrated on covering the tracks of various public officials implicated in the investigation and practiced damage control for what they perceived to be an onslaught of bad media publicity as a

honolulu and is located in the midst of many new south pacific nations the total area of american samoa is about 75 square miles most archeologists believe that these small islands are the origin of the polynesian culture that settled much of the pacific from hawaii to new zealand many archeological sites of this ancient culture exist on the islands of american samoa but few have as yet been fully investigated the vegetation of american samoa consists of five types of paleotropical rain forests coast ridge lowland montane and cloud there has been minimal disturbance of the rain forests by man over several thousand years and almost onethird of the area has never been disturbed the forest has great diversity with hundreds of different plant species often being found in a few acres many of these plants are now being studied for medicinal value including 150 species subject to national institutes of health investigations into possible cancer cures animal life is as widely diverse except for mammals fiftyfive species of birds are found in american samoa along with a large number of amphibians and reptiles the coral reefs around the islands are populated by swarms of reef fish the only mammals native to samoa are bats two of the three species of bats are the famous flying foxes with wing spans of up to 4 feet tie striking animals are often seen soaring high above the islands they feed exclusively on fruit and are the primary pollinators of the tropical forest the flying foxes have been hunted for export in recent years and their numbers have been seriously reduced

jurisdiction of the united states the committee on interior and insular affairs held a field inspection and heartngs in american samoa in january 1987 to assess significance of the forest and related coral reef areas and to listen to the samoan people about their concern for the land and protection for their 4 000yearold culture i was overwhelmed by the beauty of this unique tropical forest and felt then and now that this area is not only of the utmost national significance but of international concern since we who have urged diplomatic protocols on other nations to protect tropical forests had not taken any steps to protect the only paleotropical forest in oar jurisdiction i talked to the samoans regarding their views toward establishing a national park the governor legislature and other political leaders strongly supported and support the park today in meeting with village chiefs and other traditional leaders support for the concept of a national park was nearly unanimous whoever it was learned that almost all land in samoapercent plusis communally owned through the village or family system in addition the samoan constitution forbids the sale of any land without 100percent approval of the villagefamilyand approval of the governor although such lands may be leased for up to 55 years the boundaries of much of the land controlled by various villages and families

500 acres on the island of tau and about 225 acres on the island of ofu totaling about 8 500 acres the land would be leased from the samoan people for 50 years with options for renewal cost of the lease would be negotiated by the secretary 1h 7526 of the interior and the governor of samoa the secretary would manage the park to protect the natural and cultural values american samoans are rquired
