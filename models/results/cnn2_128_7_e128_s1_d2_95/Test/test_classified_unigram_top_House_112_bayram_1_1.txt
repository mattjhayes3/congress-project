they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and billionaires and bringing our troops home from afghanistan my friends on

we took a voluntary pay cut to this country then we prosecute two big wars to the tune of a trillion dollars and under the bush administration they had those wars on a whole set of different books they didnt really account for it as part of the debt of this country now under president obama we have real accounting so we know how bad the books look and then we had this crash on wall street now those things all add up to a lot of debt there is no doubt about it and when the country hit the crash the income to the country dropped and the expenses went up i dont think we should ever forget how

[0.0, 1.0, 1, "budgets are not simply about dollars and cents they are about values and priorities and the debate over spending has revealed republican priorities in my opinion in the worst possible light first republicans passed a spending plan for the remainder of the fiscal year that would cripple americas ability to outinnovate outeducate and outbuild its competitors that spending plan would cut billions in medical and energy research cut out support for 20 000 research scientists kick 200 000 children out of head start put college out of reach for millions of middle class students and end vital infrastructure projects in 40 states infrastructure projects which provide american jobs a consensus of nonpartisan economists has found that the plan will cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and mark zandi moodys analytics chief economist and an adviser to senator mccains presidential campaign said that it would cost almost 700 000 jobs in addition to these skewed priorities republicans are insisting that any bill any bill to keep the government open must also include controversial social policy provisions that have little if anything to do with the deficit even though their own pledge to america promised to end the practice of packaging unpopular bills with mustpass legislation bills that should pass on their merits not as related to some extraneous issue rather than compromise with president obama with the democrats in the senate and the house republicans are threatening once again to shut down government as they did in 1995 now they tell us that they will back off on their threat but only if we pass a partisan 1week spending bill that triples the ransom to keep the government open in other words this bill contains three times the weekly cuts as the last weektoweek bill did it also takes all cuts from only a small slice of the budget frankly that makes this latest bill a mockery of fiscal responsibility especially because it leaves entirely untouched for the rest of the year what the secretary of defense himself has called the pentagons culture of endless money this partisan patch contradicts republicans own promises to put everything on the table defense spending included listen to their own words as reported by the associated press on january 23 the houses new majority leader representative eric cantor of virginia has said defense programs could join others on the cutting board but of course they havent done that new york times january 27 representative chris gibson a tea partyendorsed freshman republican and retired army colonel made it clear that no part of the pentagons 550 billion budget some 700 billion including the wars in iraq and afghanistan was immune this deficit that we have threatens our very way of life and everything needs to be on the table however they have not done that congressman mike pence on january 7 said if we are going to put our fiscal house in order we have to be able to look at defense we need a strong defense i am a supporter of a strong defense but to take those dollars off the table is irresponsible and inconsistent with the representations that our republican friends have made those words are sounding very hollow however today why are republicans breaking their word madam speaker because in my opinion they know that the only way to get their conference to support this spending bill is to bribe it with a year of defense spending left untouched and a divisive social policy provision as well which is what they said they would not do what we need to do is sit down and over the next 72 hours now over the next 48 hours frankly come to compromise thats our job my way or the highway is never going to get it done finally republicans showed their priorities in their budget for the upcoming fiscal year we will have a lot to say about that in the days ahead their budget ends medicare as we know it seniors thought that they were going to protect medicare well their way of protecting it is ending it it dismantles medicaid and other vital programs for our seniors we will talk a lot about that in the coming days and on top of that it includes yet trillions more in

about jobs this set of bills is not a jobs bill to call it that is a pure smoke screen i quoted mark zandi before i dont think its meaningful in terms of jobs its more trying to clean up something that needs cleaning up thats the 3 percent withholding bill the majority leader called upon the senate to act to act on bills that essentially would allow mercury to continue to be accessible and other bills that are called jobs bills deregulation where its necessary to regulate thats a jobs bill and the majority leader called again on the senate to act we havent had a single hearing here in the house on the presidents jobs bill not a single hearing the president has proposed to cut the payroll tax in half for 98 percent of the businesses a complete payroll tax holiday for adding workers extending 100 percent expensing not a single hearing on that preventing up to 280 000 teacher layoffs not a single hearing on that dont call on the senate the majority leader should call on the house himself and the committees to hold hearings on these bills the infrastructure bill a bipartisan national infrastructure bank not a single hearing and then unemployment insurance at the end of this year in next month a million people will lose their unemployment benefits if we dont act and extend the federal program and a million and a half by midfebruary so i call upon the house to act a 4 000 tax credit to employers for hiring the longterm unemployed not a single hearing no action i suggest to the majority they not look to the other body but to look to themselves so im glad the majority leader came here now i want to say just a word about the bill right before us mr crowley has suggested that we look at the facts and i think we should before we vote i think all of us want to know what were voting on and essentially this revision of the modified adjusted gross income provision in terms of potential impact on health care according to the joint tax committee and the cbo will likely have this effect and i want everybody to understand it between 500 000 and a million individuals will no longer be eligible for medicaid thats their estimate of those who no longer are eligible for medicaid about 500 000 will be eligible for tax credits unless the republicans ever succeeded in eliminating them but of that additional number between 500 000 and a million about 500 000 people as a result if this bill becomes law will likely lose their health coverage altogether unless they had available to them insurance through their employer thats the estimate of the joint tax committee were talking about vulnerable populations here were talking about early retirees and were talking about the disabled and we need to understand those facts as presented by the joint tax committee and by cbo a second problem here is that essentially were using a provision relating to health to address a business tax problem it is a problem for the government and for the business community in the 3 percent withholding provision which we should repeal but we should understand the implications the ways and means committee has traditionally said dont do it that way lets also remember that were going to have before us a provision relating to physician reimbursement rates in medicare and were going to have to find the funds to pay for it and essentially what would be doing now is to use up a provision that impacts health and lose the possibility of using it in terms of improving health programs such as reimbursement the last point i want to make is we tried to present an alternative an alternative within business taxation it relates to the taxation of the oil and gas industry mr blumenauer earlier talked about things that were kind of done in the dark of night and this provision the 3 percent if it wasnt the dark of night it wasnt fully in the daylight but the oil and gas provision in section 199 was added indeed in the dark of night it provided some tax benefits to the oil and gas industry in a bill that related to manufacturing when oil and gas did not fall within that purview and it was essentially put in in the dark of night and it would be much preferable to address that issue and pay for the bill that needs to pass rather than essentially starting on a path that mr crowley has described that according to cbo and the joint tax committee is likely to lead up to half a million people having no health coverage at all everybody should understand that price and then everybody can make up their own mind but they should understand whats involved here this is not a technical change it isnt a glitch it is a tax definition by the way as mr crowley has pointed out and it also applies to other areas where i think we need to be very careful in terms of its application so those are the facts and everybody can make up their own mind but lets not pretend this is a jobs bill when the majority here has essentially had a deaf ear to bringing up the jobs bill presented by the president and lets not pretend that this will have no impact on health insurance and health coverage for lots of people who are the early retirees and the disabled these by and large are not wealthy people and there are examples given that are true in the extreme but for the mainstream in this country the early retirees and the disabled theyre not on the fringes in terms of income in terms of wealth these are the facts i hope as everybody comes to vote on this billthis second billthey will look at the facts and make up their own mind i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "for decades medicare has been a lifeline for older americans providing quality and affordable health care for all seniors but this week house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this spending is protected by the republican budget and

you know we hear one after another of my republican colleagues coming up here and selfrighteously talking about ending the demagoguery and we should end the tv ads and i just want to remind you that through the 2010 elections the republicans went on television and yes how about demagogued the issue of medicare saying that democrats wanted to cut 500 billion from medicare well lets talk about the truth we were challenged just a little while ago what is your plan well here was our plan to save medicare and that was to say in the affordable care act yes we are going to cut subsidies to the insurance companies that meant that we were bilking the government and the taxpayers and we were having to overpay them and yes we are going to cut waste and fraud from the medicare program and thats how we are going to save 500 billion but not only would we not cut a single penny from benefits but we were actually able to increase benefits while trimming medicare we you knowso you scared the heck out of seniors but never mentioned of course at the same time we reduced the cost of medicare we improved medicare by adding to its solvency we closed the doughnut hole making prescription drugs more affordable and we provided a wellness exam every year at no cost and we provided preventive services with no cost sharing but nevertheless on television those ads warned against those democrats who didnt cut one thing from medicare and improve it and now you are saying well we are not going to do anything to people 55 and under to me that sounds like 55 and under you better look out now the ads in new york are working because people love their medicare and what they dont want to see you know all but four republicans voted to literally end medicare you can call it something else but you cant call it medicare because those guaranteed benefits are gone it makes huge cuts in medicare benefits seniors that fall under the new plan would have to pay about 6 000 more a year thats what the congressional budget office says 6 000 more a year out of pocket for their health care and it would put insurance company bureaucrats in charge of seniors health care letting insurers decide what tests and what treatment that seniors get throwing seniors back into the arms of the insurance companies who have shown no love to them and so lets look at what the american people think about medicare well if you are 65 years and older 93 percent of americans say the medicare program as it is right now is very important or somewhat important to them actually 83 percent very important if they are 55 to 64 91 percent say medicare is very important and if you are 40 to 54 we have got 79 percent of americans who say the medicare program is very or somewhat important and if you are 18 to 39 75 percent people get it medicare works medicare is efficient medicare is good for our country for people with disabilities and for the seniors and if we are looking to save medicare we do have a plan we know how to make that more efficient we have done it in the affordable care act and we are willing to sit down and talk about how we make medicare more efficient but not by ruining destroying and getting rid of medicare to the point that youve got to find another name it wont be medicare anymore and so theyve admitted it seems to me that people 55 and younger you better look out because that program that will allow our seniors to live perhaps to 90 years old people who are going to be eligible for medicare as it is right now will no longer be in place and we are not talking about

going to accomplish there is going to be tremendous harm we have a social contract with seniors to provide affordable accessible comprehensive health care under medicare and they want to take medicare and end it and tell those people to go to private insurance companies we have estimates that the average senior will face cost increases of 6 000 when the program begins and it could be over 11 000 per beneficiary in later years but right away to add insult to injury they would reopen the doughnut hole under the part d prescription drug benefit meaning people still have to pay all of the cost of their drugs reversing what the affordable care act provided but most of their cuts are coming from the medicaid program they want to take medicaid and turn it into a block grant medicaid accounts for 43 percent of total longterm care spending in the unitedstates most of it goes to seniors and disabled people who are in nursing homes if the states dont have enough money in their block grants are they going to dump these people these are human beings and you are playing with their lives this means real harm will be inflicted where medicaid spending is the greatest by cutting reimbursement rates medicaid will lose providers nursing home quality and staffing levels will decline reject this budget dont experiment on the most vulnerable of our population mr chair i strongly oppose the republican budget resolution for fiscal year 2012 their budget inflicts terrible harm on americans from all walks of lifewhile protecting the wealthiest taxpayers in america both individuals and corporations i am particularly disturbed by what the republican budget does to medicare and medicaid there is no other way to put it the republican budget is the end of medicare as we know it and it is devastating for medicare beneficiaries medicare is a social contract with our seniors to provide affordable accessible comprehensive health care the republicans want to turn medicare over to the private insurance industry with payments to seniors that will fall far short of what they need to get the health care they deserve the congressional budget office analysis of the republican budget shows that over the next decade it will more than double beneficiary cost for new enrollees the average senior will face increased costs of over 6 000 annually when the program begins and all of that extra spending by seniors and people with disabilities will go to private health insurance plans the transfer of seniors into private plans will raise costs by over 11 000 per beneficiary by to add insult to injury the republican budget reopens the donut hole under the part d prescription drug benefit increasing the burden on seniors starting today for medicaid the republican budget is even worse medicaid covers 60 million of the countrys most vulnerable people one in 3 low income children 5 million seniors and 10 million disabled individuals it accounts for 43 percent of total long term care spending in the unitedstates but the republican budget cuts medicaid in half by 2022 and turns it into a block grant for the states right away and since the medicaid block grant would grow by only 1 percent per year while inflation is over 2 percent and health inflation and enrollment growth is even higher this means real harm will be inflicted where medicaid spending is the greatest on seniors and individuals with disabilities in nursing homes and those receiving benefits to live independently in their home by cutting reimbursement rates medicaid will lose health providers nursing

said that the provision is both constitutional and wise in a letter to pto director david kappos general mukasey stated that the bills constitutionality is assured because it leaves unchanged the existing requirement that a patent issue only to one who invents or discovers also this provision actually returns us to a system that our founders created and used themselves early american patent law that of our founders generation did not concern itself with who was the firsttoinvent the unitedstates operated under a firstinventortoregister which is a system very similar to the firstinventorto file it wasnt until the 1870s when the courts created interference proceedings that our patent system began to consider who was the firsttoinvent an invention these interference proceedings disadvantaged independent inventors and small businesses over time interference proceedings have become a costly litigation tactic that has forced some manufacturers to take the path of least resistance and move operations and jobs overseas rather than risk millions or billions of dollars in capital investment the america invents act does away with interference proceedings and includes a provision to address prior user rights without jeopardizing american businesses and jobs opponents of the firstinventortofile system claim that it may disadvantage independent inventors who cannot file quickly enough but the current system lulls inventors into a false sense of security based on the belief that they can readily and easily rely on being the firstto invent inventors forget that to have any hope of winning an interference proceeding they must comply with complex legal procedures and then spend over 500 000 to try to prove that they were the firsttoinvent in the last 7 years under the current system of interference proceedings only one independent inventor out of 3 million patent applications has proved an earlier date of invention over the inventor who filed first one out of 3 million in fact the current patent systems costly and complex legal environment is what truly disadvantages independent inventors who often lose their patent rights because they cant afford the legal battle over ownership the america invents act reduces frivolous litigation over weak or overbroad patents by establishing a pilot program to review a limited group of business method patents that never should have been awarded in the first place section 18 deals with mistakes that occurred following an activist judicial decision that created a new class of patents called business method patents in the late 1990s the pto was ill equipped to handle the flood of business method patent applications few examiners had the necessary background and education to understand the inventions and the pto lacked information regarding prior art as a result the pto issued some weak patents that have lead to frivolous lawsuits the pilot program allows the pto to reexamine a limited group of questionable business method patents and it is supported by the pto former 10th circuit federal appeals court judge michael mcconnell sent me a constitutional analysis of the bills reexamination proceedings he stated that there is nothing novel or unprecedented much less unconstitutional about the procedures proposed in sections 6 and 18 the application of these new reexamination procedures to existing patents is not a taking or otherwise a violation of the constitution supporters of this bill understand that if americas inventors are forced to waste time with frivolous litigation they wont have time for innovation thats why the unitedstates chamber of commerce national association of manufacturers phrma bio the information technology industry council

us this amendment is a test will we put every federal agencys budget on the table in our quest to control spending and reduce debt or are there privileged categories will we continue down the path of trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor the disabled schoolchildren and seniors the pentagon spending bill before us some 650 billion nearly twothirds of a trillion dollars is about equal to all military spending of all the rest of the worldall of our allies all of our potential adversaries and all of those countries that americans rarely think about all put together the amendment that mr frank and i and some of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle are offering today is truly a modest proposal it would simply cut the rate of increase in pentagon spending instead of allowing a 17 billion increase over this years level it would cut that increase in half just to see if we are willing to do that now my colleague mr cole puts this i think in the wrong context i mean we should talk about sure in 1960 it was a larger part of the budget that is before we had medicare before we had a lot of programs but when you ask yourself is our military structured to deal with the problems this country faces and to expect from other countries in the world their share of what must be done the answer surely is this is an unsustainable size this amendment was born out of a series of discussions among mr frank and mr paul and mr jones and some other members and i have had over several months recently we sent a joint letter that outlined our concerns about the state of our spending on national security we point out not only the excessive unquestioned overall size of military spending but also that this is a result of the military that is indeed a remnant of the cold war to go back to mr coles comments and it bears far more than our share of keeping the peace and is still structured to overwhelm the soviet union more than to deal with todays actual threats to our security to take one example that the cosponsors of this amendment may or may not agree with me on but we might ask why do we need a replacement for the b2 bomber it was not the b2 bomber or any bomber that killed osama bin laden it was unitedstates special operations buying new nuclear bombers would simply be a form i think of defense sector corporate welfare to protect against a threat that went away decades ago i could cite multiple additional disconnects between our defense spending priorities and the actual threats we face one that comes to mind is libya as we note in our letter it has been widely reported in the press that england and france have been pressing the united states to resume its earlier role in libya because theyve been unable to assume it themselves the explanation is that only america has the capacity to respond our point precisely we have allowed other nations in the world to grow into an overdependence on americas military and americas tax dollars and the expenditure of american money and lives far beyond whats appropriate for our share of world peacekeeping all of us who support this amendment want to protect our country thats precisely why weve offered our proposal and this amendment to put ourselves on track for a better structured military spending money on cold warera weapons to wage undeclared wars of choice is clear evidence of misguided needlessly expensive priorities if the house cannot even pass an amendment that simply cuts the rate of increase in pentagon spending it will never pass amendments that actually make the

and theyve all made it very clear to me that it is more than past time to bring resolution to this longstanding issue i agree the minnesota chippewa tribe entered into a 20 million legal settlement with the united states government in 1999 to compensate for damages stemming from the improper taking of land and valuation of timber under the nelson act of 1889 these settlement funds have been sitting in a department of the interior trust fund ever since and with interest have grown to about 28 million that money now belongs to the minnesota chippewa tribe the united states only role in this has been to temporarily hold it in trust for them until it can be distributed thus ive joined with my fellow minnesota representatives mr peterson and mr paulsen in cosponsoring the legislation before you today this legislation puts forth a disbursement formula which reflects and honors the formula decided democratically by the governing body of the minnesota chippewa tribe known as the tribal executive committee this formula voted for and passed by the committee supports a per capita apportionment of 300 each to each member followed by a sixway split for the remaining settlement funds importantly h r 1272 will distribute the settlement funds according to the formula that has been determined by the cbo to have no budgetary impact it is always difficult to craft a compromise between such varied and competing interests however the compromise represented in this bill respects the decision of the governing body of the entity that brought forth the claim on behalf of all six bands and the unitedstates court of federal claims recognizes as having the constitutional authority to enter into a proposed settlement on behalf of all six bands all six bands shared equally in the expense of the risk of prosecuting the case and the tribal executive committee provided the six bands an equal opportunity to vote on how the judgment funds should be distributed the release of the 28 million to the members of the chippewa tribe will have positive implications far beyond just righting a past wrong this money will flow directly into the hands of the bands and their members sparking much needed consumer activity and hopefully investment in the reservations in northern minnesota this will benefit the entire region h r 1272 is the solution that must be enacted in order to fulfill

we feel passionately about the need to expand individual initiative and opportunity in this country and to characterize us as doing nothing but wanting to close down the government and being controlled by some outside group we as republicans want to work in a bipartisan way because we recognize that barack obama is the president of the united states and that the democrats have control in the united states senate thats why speaker boehner has worked diligently in pursuing the goals and the priorities that we have but at the same time he has recognized that we cant get it all no one is happy with this measure that is before us speaker boehner is not happy with this measure that is before us but he understands that we have to ensure that we dont see the nation go over the brink and that we do in fact increase the debt ceiling but his goal has been to get to the root cause as weve now found out 75 times the debt ceiling has been increased since 1962 in fact im told that former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld as hes on his book tour is now talking about the fact that weve seen the increase that he had to vote on in 1962 it was a 250 billion increase in the debt ceiling at that time and it was the first of 75 increases that weve had never before in our history have we focused on getting at the root cause of why it is we have to increase the debt ceiling so it was a very interesting presentation that my friend just gave but i will tell you that i want to work with him and that i want to work with other democrats to make sure that we address this and do it for the american people with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.034666508436203, 0.465333491563797, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 1540 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 which overwhelmingly passed the committee on armed services on a vote of 601 in keeping with the committees tradition of bipartisanship ranking member smith and i worked collaboratively to produce the bill and solicited input from each of our members the legislation will advance our national security aims provide the proper care and logistical support for our fighting forces and help us meet the defense challenges of the 21st century the bill authorizes 553 billion for the department of defense base budget consistent with the presidents budget request and the allocation provided by the house budget committee it also authorizes 18 billion for the development of the department of energys defense programs and 118 9 billion for overseas contingency operations the legislation we will consider today also makes good on my promise when i was selected to lead the armed services committee that this committee would scrutinize the department of defenses budget and identify inefficiencies to invest those savings into higher national security priorities we examined every aspect of the defense enterprise not as a target for arbitrary funding reductions as the current administration has proposed but to find ways that we can accomplish the mission of providing for the common defense more effectively the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 achieves these goals by working to ensure our troops deployed in afghanistan iraq and around the world have the equipment resources authorities training and time they need to successfully complete their missions and return home safely provide our warfighters and their families with the resources and support they need deserve and have earned invest in the capabilities and force structure needed to protect the united states from current and future threats mandate physical responsibility transparency and accountability within the department of defense and incentivize competition for every taxpayer dollar associated with funding department of defense requirements i know there have been many questions raised by the aclu and others relating to a provision in our bill dealing with the 2001 authorization for use of military force i would like to address some of those concerns now section 1034 of the ndaa affirms that the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations organizations and persons who are part of or are substantially supporting al qaeda the taliban and associated forces it also explicitly affirms the presidents authority to detain certain belligerents who qualify under this standard i just described which congress has never explicitly stated its important to note that the unitedstates supreme court has accepted the presidents authority to detain belligerents as within the powers granted by the aumf moreover the language in section 1034 is very similar to the obama administrations interpretation of the authorities provided pursuant to aumf in particular a march 13 2009 filing in the unitedstates district court for the district of columbia while unitedstates courts have accepted the administrations interpretation of the aumf it is under constant attack in litigation relating to the petitions filed by guantanamo detainees because of these ongoing challenges the administrations interpretation may receive less favorable treatment over time if congress refuses to affirm it section 1034 is not intended to alter the presidents existing authority pursuant to the aumf in any way its intended only to reinforce it i believe that our men and women in uniform deserve to be on solid legal footing as they risk their lives in defense of the united states finally some have suggested section 1034 was included in the dark of night i note that this language was originally included in the detainee security act of 2011 introduced on march 9 and was discussed during a committee hearing on march 17 we have sought input from the administration as well as ranking member smith his staff and numerous outside experts moreover the process used to craft this legislation is historic in its transparency in fact a copy of my mark was distributed to committee members offices 5 days before our markup the legislation including funding tables was posted online nearly 48 hours in advance of our markup its also noteworthy that there are no earmarks in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 every member request to fund a defense capability was voted on and includes language requiring meritbased or competitive selection procedures to those who are concerned that members may unduly influence the department of defense to direct funds to a particular entity i can only recall the words of my good friend the former chairman of the armed services committee ike skelton who would say read the amendment what does it say if dod chooses to violate the law and the text of a provision in the ndaa requiring meritbased selection the armed services committee will take them to task finally i thank the chairman and the ranking member of the rules committee for working with us to bring this measure to the floor i urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill in partnership with you we look forward to passing the 50th consecutive national defense authorization act i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.03698539733886719, 0.4630146026611328, 1, "thank you and i agree wholeheartedly with whats been said so far and what i really want to say is medicare is run more efficiently than nearly any insurance company in the world they devote less than 2 percent of its funding to administrative expenses and you compare that to a private insurance company that costs up to 40 percent of premiums for individuals and small group plans for administration and to pay their executives sixand sevenfigure salaries to do the same thing thats administrated by medicare officials also the attempt to move medicare eligibility from 65 to 67 sounds like an easy fix well not only as was spoken earlier the recipients those people that are 64 65 66 going into that category are people that possibly are already struggling lost their jobs they need that health care they have a preexisting condition and now their very life is threatened having to wait that much longer we all look to take care of small business and private insurance funds such as vebas and those types of institutions that money is forecast to pay for various health care and you stretch out 2 more years of their coverage small business now has to pay higher premiums to cover those employees that last those 2 more years and they either have to make a choice they reduce what they give in coverage or they eliminate it altogether or they shift those premium costs to the worker its happened over and over and over again and we need to avoid that in this coming legislation"]]}
