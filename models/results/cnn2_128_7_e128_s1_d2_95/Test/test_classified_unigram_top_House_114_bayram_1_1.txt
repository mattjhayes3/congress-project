committee if adopted the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended i rise to speak in support of the democratic motion to recommit that would protect the civil rights of students at schools that receive vouchers by requiring the schools to certify that they provide each student with all applicable civil rights protections the d c voucher program calls into question multiple federal civil rights protections and turns a blind eye to the governmentfunded discrimination for example religious schools that accept vouchers are permitted to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring a violation of traditional principles prohibiting discrimination based on religion when using federal money the fact is that most religious schools are part of a ministry of the sponsoring church and these schools either cannot or will not separate the religious content from their academic programs so it is impossible to prevent a publicly funded voucher program for paying for these institutions religious activities and education furthermore schools that accept vouchers are allowed to discriminate based on gender in admissions a violation of the principles of title ix in addition to the discrimination based on religion or sex the d c voucher program also raises serious concerns about the civil rights of students with disabilities idea requires that schools that receive federal idea funds provide appropriate education to all students with disabilities but at least one study found that the schools that accept d c vouchers serve students with disabilities at a much lower rate than public schools failing to meet the needs of students with disabilities is just one of the shortcomings of the d c voucher program but another issue is the performance of the school a 2010 department of education report concluded that the use of a voucher had no statistically significant impact on overall student achievement in math or reading additional studies found that students from schools in need of improvement have shown no improvement in math or reading due to the voucher program furthermore participating in the voucher program had no impact on student safety satisfaction motivation or engagement many of those who actually won a voucher cannot use them because the voucher does not cover the full cost of attending a private or religious school as a result many who win a voucher find that they cannot use it because they cant afford the remaining cost of the education so studies have confirmed that fewer than 25 percent of the students who use the vouchers are from schools that were in need of improvement the d c voucher program fails on all counts it violates principles of traditional civil rights laws it makes no improvement on student achievement and it fails to reach the very children it was designed to help our public schools need more funding not less rather than funnel taxpayer funding to private or religious schools that lack civil rights protections

checks well i will tell you why it is because they are responsible gun owners and responsible gun owners understand that there is nothing wrong with making sure that a prospective gun buyer isnt a terrorist a criminal a domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill the supreme court made that perfectly clear in district of columbia v heller the court ruled that while americans have the right to keep and bear arms there are no constitutional problems with laws prohibiting felons and the dangerously mentally ill from carrying guns as a responsible gun owner myself i will never give up my guns and i will never ask lawabiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to give up theirs and like other responsible gun owners i understand that if gun violence continues unabated then eventually we will see laws that place substantial and overly burdensome restrictions on our right to own guns to reduce gun violence we dont need to stop lawabiding citizens who use guns for hunting sport shooting and personal protection from obtaining those firearms we need to stop terrorists criminals domestic abusers and those with a history of dangerous mental illness from getting guns our first line of defense when it comes to making sure that guns dont fall into dangerous hands is to conduct a background check and we know that when used background checks work every day background checks stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun but sadly a gaping loophole allows those same felons dangerously mentally ill and domestic abusers to bypass a background check in 34 states all they have to do is go online or go to a gun show that is wrong that is dangerous and that loophole needs to be closed that is why it is long past time for the republican leadership to allow a vote on h r 1217 my bipartisan prosecond amendment bill to require a background check for all commercial gun sales the bill bolsters the second amendment rights of lawful gun owners by making sure that the bad guys cant easily bypass background checks when trying to buy a gun just as important for the safety and security of our country and our fellow americans is h r 1076 bipartisan prosecond amendment legislation to prohibit those who are on the fbis terrorist watch list from being able to legally buy a firearm we should be able to agree that suspected terrorists shouldnt be able to legally buy a gun or guns of their choosing as a responsible gun owner i am fed up with those who are blindly opposed to background checks hiding behind bumper sticker slogans like guns dont kill people people kill people everyone knows that guns dont kill people which is exactly why responsible gun owners and the overwhelming majority of the american people understand that it is important to run a background check to see if the person buying the gun is a danger to our community this debate isnt a choice between respecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence as a responsible gun owner i am tired of it being framed that way it is about this congress doing both the supreme courts heller ruling provides people on both sides with an opportunity to work within the confines of the second amendment to pass legislation that will reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe responsible gun owners across our country

heavy today we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this nation congressman louis stokes was the first african american to represent the state of ohio in congress where he served for more than 30 years he rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas this included being named the first african american to serve as chairman of the prestigious house permanent select committee on intelligence as an african american who now sits on that committee i am deeply honored to follow in louis stokes footsteps during his tenure on the permanent select committee on intelligence he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the reagan administrations foreign policy he spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland in honoring his memory we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community we must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats it was congressman lou stokes who taught us that our nation deserves nothing less today we also honor an american treasure and one of my personal heroes the courageous mrs amelia boynton robinson mrs robinson passed away on august 26 2015 at the age of 110yes 110 mrs amelia boynton robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in selma alabama she is often remembered for her critical role in bloody sunday on that solemn day on the edmund pettus bridge robinson was savagely beaten a photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in the new york times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote yet this tireless fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all americans amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement and it was her courage along with john lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill the voting rights bill were drafted on her kitchen table in selma alabama in 1965 ms boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate she put her money where her mouth was and she herself ran for congress on may 5 1964 amelia boynton broke yet another barrier when she became the first woman in the state of alabama and the first african american woman in the state of alabama to run for congress in 1964 she garnered 10 7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote actually only 1 percent of the registered voters were african americans at that time her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in alabama and in this nation without her courageous campaign for the seventh congressional district of alabama in 1964 i know that my election to this seat in 2010 some 50 years later would not have been possible her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the halls of congress and i will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day for i get to do what she could not and that is vote on behalf of the members of the seventh congressional district of alabama for that i am eternally grateful in fact one of my most memorable moments in this chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the state of the union on january 20 2015 this past year i am grateful for the memories of her greeting president obama that night i am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent but a beloved mentor and friend as she is remembered and she reminds us every day by her life there is still much work to be done finally i would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights mr julian bond this courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life but he is most remembered for his service as the naacp chairman and the cofounder of the southern poverty law center he was also one of the original leaders of the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc while he was a student at morehouse college he later served in the georgia general assembly for more than 20 years he was first elected to the georgia house of representatives in 1965 however because of his longstanding legacy of fighting white supremacy white statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat this brave spirit was undeterred he spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of blacks in the state of georgia in addition to his time as an eloquent speaker he was a celebrated writer poet television commentator community advocate as well as a communication specialist he did so much for the southern

nuclear negotiations with iran secretary kerry and others raised bobs case at every single meeting and we have been told that the deal to release the other americans opened new avenues for consultation on bobs case but we cannot wait whatever information iran has about bob needs to be provided now so that bob can be brought home this resolution before us today calls on iran to follow through on its repeated promises of assisting the united states in locating bob the resolution calls on our government and those of our partners and allies to continue to press iran for information about bob at every opportunity president obama and secretary kerry have repeatedly expressed their commitment to securing bobs release and secretary kerry reiterated that commitment during testimony in the house just last week president obama has stated in january when referencing bobs case he said we will not rest until their family is whole again for anyone who is watching this debate today i

what this bill does and what this rule is that you are going to be voting on it just says let the sec go first now i know that is hard to understand and if you are watching this you might have a hard time understanding because my friend just said that we wont wait on a rule and then that we are repealing a rule so i am not sure how you can repeal a rule that you have not waited on and if the rule is not there you are repealing no we are simply saying let the sec go first so you cant repeal something that your own statement said you are waiting on and also by the way a dear colleague letter that says that we know from many many of my democrat friends across the aisle are sending around saying dol we have got a lot of concerns about this we want to make sure you do it right i think this is a good way to do it and it is called being part of a bipartisan solution here on the floor and lets put it back right and let it go that way instead of sending a letter to dol and letting them make sure they get it right because they acknowledge that there are real concerns about the workability of this rule in progress and this is right now being circulated i think i just want to say i support this bill h r 1090 because i believe that men and women should have the ability to choose their type of financial professional who best meets their investment needs this isnt about protecting investors it is about the administration once again telling families that they know what is best for them they have told families that they know better when it comes to health care they have told families they know better when it comes to education they have told families they know better when it comes how and where to spend their money and the results have been devastating h r 1090 isnt going to undo all the devastating impacts of this onesizefitsall regulatory approach but it will prevent from taking away the ability of families to plan their financial future this bill passed with bipartisan support last congress and on behalf of my constituents i deeply hope it does so again again it is about who you fight for it is a consistency i will consistently stand here and say what is best for those hardworking middle class lower income class and anybody else who earns as much as they want to to have the access to get the financial planning they need in the way that is best for

comments and for her continued pursuit of making sure we pass this this bill was first introduced over a year ago reworked with a lot of bipartisan input members of congress from both sides of the aisle and also from many many organizations the other day some 23 organizations delivered a letter to some members of congress saying they want to see comprehensive mental health reform this is the first and the most comprehensive mental health reform our country has seen the last time some efforts were made it was the very last bill that president kennedy signed before he was assassinated to begin to make some change in our country to move away from the asylums and towards community mental health unfortunately that dream only came partially true because what happened is we closed those asylums back in the 1950s we had 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in this country at that time the population of the country was 150 million now the population of the country is over 316 million 320 million and we only have 40 000 psych beds now some of that is because we have come up with more effective treatments better ways of identifying and diagnosing people better medications and quite frankly those asylums of yesteryear needed to close many times they were homes of abuse and given nicknames like snake pits cuckoos nests and other derogatory terms because they were so bad but then along came community medical health centers and that was supposed to pick up the slack as states found that they could close these asylums they looked and saw that they could save some money and they didnt put the money into mental health services nor did the federal government what happened instead was the people traded the hospital bed for the jail cell for the homeless shelter and for the morgue that is where we are today now it is not for lack of trying because indeed the federal government has spent a lot of moneysome 100plus billion a yearon this mostly through disability payments but some for federal programs what i want to do tonight is now talk about 10 things we can do as a nation to deal with this 10 things we must do first of all the general accounting office report that we commissioned from the energy and commerce committee we said tell us what programs there are in the federal government that deal with mental health and more specifically serious mental illness i was amazed to hear how many there were 112 agencies scattered across eight departments it is a dysfunctional and uncoordinated system it is a system that really does not have central control it is a system that has not even met among these agencies for years even though one of the agencies samhsa substance abuse and mental health services administration is supposed to be the lead agency to say get together and meet they hadnt even met since 2009 by the way when we had a hearing on this in the oversight and investigations subcommittee they said oh we will start doing that soon but this report that came out that excoriated the federal programs said that they are not only uncoordinated but nobody even checks to see if what they do works they are programs with the department of defense veterans affairs education health and human services hud the list goes on and on i think there are 20plus programs for homelessness there was redundancy and there was overlap but it is not coordinated we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty so here is number one of what we want to do we want to have the office of the assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse createda new office but not new money we do not need any money for this we take the current office of samhsa and elevate that title of the person who runs that agency to the level of an assistant secretary that persons job will be to create an annual report to congress to tell us the state of the states tell us how they spend their money that they get from the federal level tell us what are the best practices out there that can serve as models for other states collect that data right now what we do get is data on numbers of suicides we get some homicide data but we really dont get that much on homeless data we have soso quality of data for substance abuse what happens there but for the most part no one asks about these agencies and coordinates them this persons job is to do this more so this person is going to have to be a mental health provider someone who understands the field the last director of samhsa was an attorney perhaps wellintended but did not understand the field just like you would not appoint someone to head the joint chiefs of staff to run the army who is not a general or the navy who is not an admiral you need someone to run this who knows what they are doing in addition to coordinating these agencies what they would do is give a report to congress of which ones can be eliminated because they are redundant merge the money together make more money available and send more money out to communities let congress then act to revamp these multiple organizations to do what is most effective to get funding back to the communities and to the people where it is needed not to stay in washington d c i think president reagan talked about perhaps some proof of eternity is a federal program what we dont want to have here is the continuation of programs that exist just for the sake of employment programs should exist for the sake of doing the right thing for people out there and right now we have a failure the second item is to drive evidencebased care another general accounting office report which came out talked about some of the abysmal conditions here they were saying that agencies had difficulty identifying programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness because they didnt always track whether or not such individuals were among those served by the program again samhsa in the pastwhich is supposed to lead these organizationsdoesnt really track to say what are the evidencebased programs you are doing when we had a hearing on these issues samhsa told me afterwards they would change nothing they do list some evidencebased programs but the evidence base is oftentimes people who do programs and say take my word for it it works if it works why do we have millions of people with mental illness why do we have 4 million people not getting any care at all why do we continue to fill our jails homeless shelters and morgues with people with mental illness there are some excellent programs out there quite frankly but there are also many that need to be changed as part of this process it was stated in the gao report that many of the programs hadnt completed their evaluations many had no evaluations some were underway and 17 programs had no evaluation completed and none planned so the government was not even looking to see if what they were doing had any value we are going to change that we are going to make sure the programs that are out there have evidencebased care the national child traumatic stress network is an excellent program that does a great job another program is called raise response after initial schizophrenia episode it does a great job because they work in terms of getting care early in someones life when they first show symptoms it is called the prodromal stage when you get to someone early you improve their prognosis but a lot of these other programsand i will highlight some of the sloppy and irrational programs we have out here tonightcan make a difference if they are done the right way it is important to note that with regard to serious mental illness about 50 percent of those with serious mental illness it will emerge by age 14 and about 75 percent of the cases by age 24 every time a person has what the public popularly knows as a breakdown or we refer to it as a psychological or psychiatric crisis there is harm that occurs to the person psychological harm and neurological harm because it is a brain disease so it is important to get to people early on that is why we want evidencebased care that really and truly does that and not programs that are fluff we want them to have outcome measures and determine them by the way just the opposite of that some of the things that samhsa has funded in the past have also been programs specifically geared toward telling people to stop taking their medication when people have anxiety they have plans in telling you how to drink a fruit smoothie none of those are evidencebased care and none of those treat people with serious mental illness number three go to the mental health workforce we have a serious serious shortage here of providers even if you wanted to get care you cant get care in many counties i think perhaps onefourth or onethird of counties in oregon do not even have a psychiatrist in them many do not have a clinical psychologist or clinical social workers or peer support teams with the adequacy to meet the need it is the same across the nation what happens here is there are about 9 000 child psychiatrists in this country we need 30 000 precisely for the reason i said before that these problems emerge during those adolescent and young adult years if you dont have the right qualified people you cant treat them similarly clinical psychologists counseling psychologists clinical social workers and peer support teams specifically trained and available to be out there we have massive shortages part of the job of the assistant secretary is going to be to identify what do we need in communities and how do we get them our bill authorizes for the first time minorities to work with fellowships we also authorize people to be volunteers at community health centers this is one of the bizarre things that only the federal government can do if you want to work at a community health center you can work and your medical malpractice insurance is covered if you want to volunteer it is not there now think about this if there are some wellintended and compassionateas i know many aremental health providers who want to volunteer maybe an afternoon a week give of their time to help they are not allowed to do it because the center cant afford their malpractice insurance because they would have to pay the regular rate as opposed to a federal plan rate our bill also authorizes that they can volunteer we also authorize programs with telemedicine so that when a pediatrician or a family member identifies someone in need of care they can access them immediately if need be especially in rural areas and faraway areas where there is not enough support there the next one is the shortage of mental health beds i had mentioned earlier this grave shortage where we had 550 000 beds in the 1950s we have 40 000 today it is a serious crisislevel shortage in every community during one of our hearings senator creigh deeds a state senator in virginia testified many are familiar with his story he was a former gubernatorial candidate in virginia and he took his son gus with him oftentimes campaigning around the state of virginia gus played a musical instrument and they enjoyed their time together but sadly gus deteriorated when his father who raised him fed him and clothed him took him to a hospital for care the hospital said we dont have any psych beds as they made calls and tried to find more in virginia they couldnt find any young gus was sent home with his father they wouldnt provide many details but they sent gus home gus took a knife and attacked his father nearly killing him creigh escaped and gus then killed himself all because of a lack of beds there was a story last week in the washington post about another virginia man a 24yearold man who was arrested for 5 worth of shoplifting at a 7eleven in virginia he was taken to jail for shoplifting but upon recognizing that he had a serious mental illness they wanted to get him to a hospital again there werent beds available so he stayed in that jail i believe over 70 days often naked covered in his own feces refusing to eat and losing 40 pounds ultimately he died for lack of a bed now that is not the only problem that is out there understand that we dont want to bring back those asylums but when a person is in that crisis mode it is not appropriate to bring them to a jail it is not appropriate to leave them in an emergency room for hours or days or weeks sometimes waiting for a hospital bed to open up and it certainly is inappropriate to discharge someone without any wraparound services or care but what happens is when you have a bed shortage you cannot get care for crisis by qualified persons we dont have the providers we dont have the places it is important for someone to have a clean and calm and caring environment separate from other environmental stresses and problems so you can work with them and stabilize them perhaps get them on medication help them relax help organize things for home care or outpatient care for them sometimes that takes a few days sometimes that takes a couple weeks but the idea is you need a place for them without beds oftentimes a staff simply cannot do a thorough evaluation and they sometimes then will simply make an uninformed and premature release of the individual of the consumer saying well he doesnt seem that bad we will send him home not really understanding whether or not that person is a threat to themselves or someone else understand this that even with the brain diseases of schizophrenia and bipolar when questioned someone could be in a position where when asked if they are going to harm themselves or someone else they would say no i am fine really it is okay it was just a disagreement i had they can keep it together for a little bit and if a staff is already saying look we dont have hospital beds lets send him home they will be sent home without really knowing the seriousness of their illness or providing full services further if you want to evaluate if someone is a threat to harm themselves or someone else or in imminent danger of that many times the doctors and the courts are reluctant to go through that process many times they are looking for another out and many timeslike in pennsylvania it is called a 302 procedurethey will bypass that or they will say to the patient can you just voluntarily commit yourself or promise you will be okay and you will go out and get care i want to add this because it is very important while the president and other people are talking about access to guns and talking about background checks you cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordyou cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordand if there is no place to help people when they are in crisis and if doctors and judges are not going to have someone involuntarily committed there is no record there is nothing that can appear on the national list to prevent a person from purchasing a firearm there was no time spent in a hospital where staff can truly evaluate are these delusions and hallucinations which can be controlled with medication will the person be stabilized are they a risk threat you cant do that we need more beds and our bill says there will be more this is one of those areas of incredible prejudices and bigotry you see medicaid has this rule that if you are between the ages of 21 and 64 you cannot go into a private hospital that has more than 16 beds now think about that if you have money you can go in a hospital if you are low income you are out of luck you are on the street it is a different standard that is grossly unfair and incredibly prejudicial and again i go to this point that those who are minorities or low income are treated the worst a person is ten times more likely to be treated in a jail cell than in a hospital if they are seriously mentally illten times more likely and yet that treatment in a jail cell is not appropriate at all it is not treatment oftentimes they are put in isolation they may get in a fight with a guard what started off as a small charge may end up as a felony assault charge a person with serious mental illness oftentimes for the same crime will spend four times the amount in jail as a person who is not mentally ill and all along if we had the proper place to treat them we could have done that our bill lifts this 16bed cap this ridiculously absurd 16bed cap and says instead we would like to have an average length of stay of less than 30 days that can be achieved in about 98 percent of cases it can be achieved and by the way it is far less expensive to have someone in a psychiatric hospital bed than an emergency room by about four times some studies have gone as high as saying it is about 20 times less expensive to have them in outpatient care than in a jail cell we would save a lot more money if we fixed this crisis shortage worked on other outpatient care to transition people out and wrap them around with the necessary services so they could go out more stable point number five we eliminate the same day doctor barrier another one of those ridiculously prejudicial rules out there that medicaid has that harms those of low income i mentioned a number of times that the prodromal stages of adolescents and young adulthood is when serious mental illness begins to emerge those first symptoms that sometimes someone may think is a little bit strange there is something different about this person perhaps their grades are dropping perhaps they are not taking care of themselves the way they used to perhaps they are withdrawing from relationships and friends those could be early signs of a bigger problem but it takes between first symptoms and first professional treatment on average 110 weeks over 2 years of waiting time between first symptoms in part because people are not aware of what to look for in the symptoms but in part because they are not connected with other providers here and even when they are they are not allowed to do anything the same day doctor rule is a medicaid rule which says you cant see two doctors in the same day at the same location so here is the problem if a pediatrician says to a mother or father we are very concerned about your teenage son who is in the later years 17 or so i would like him to see a psychiatrist right away because i am very concerned about the behaviors you are describing to me and then when that doctor realizes that that person is on medicaid basically medicaid says we are not paying for it how cruel and abusive is that to say to someone just because you have low income we are not going to cover the services here when this is a critical time when you have that warm handoff in the doctors office there is a 95 percent likelihood that the person will follow up according to a study by childrens hospital of pittsburgh when you wait and you say here is the number call it another day that likelihood drops below 45 percent and when you miss that golden opportunity to help a person in times of need that person may be very reluctant to come back for care in the future we fix this by saying we are going to drop that same day doctor rule number six we have to empower parents and caregivers to be part of the solution twenty years ago hipaa laws came out that said in order to help your insurance be portable we want to protect the records good idea we wanted to make sure records had privacy good idea but hipaa moved from the place where we are supposed to assist care and confidentiality to the point where it impairs care it has gone too far let me give you a couple of examples right now a doctorand i am a psychologist if i know a family member brings someone in to see me i can listen to them in a very passive mode but i cant provide them any information that is helpful they are giving me vital information for history if i dont have the accurate history a provider does not have accurate history you cant accurately diagnose you dont know if the person has been on medication before does it work or not work who has this person seen before what sets them off are they doing better what are their symptoms if i dont have or a provider does not have that information they may miss making the accurate diagnosis and then not be able to provide proper treatment and followup when that occurs harm can follow now if i get the information great but what happens if that family member is not there the provider cant go out and seek other family members and friends to get that information because hipaa laws are seen as barriers to that because as soon as a doctor at a hospital calls and says your adult son is in the hospital i need to ask you some information about it that doctor has already violated hipaa laws by identifying the persons son is in a hospital now think about this though a parent the person who was caring and loving throughout a lifetime committed to their family member a brother a sister someones mother or father they are prohibited from being part of the care team by hipaa laws a stranger some appointed worker someone who may see them as they roll in and out of their job even if they care and they burn out they will be maybe sitting next to a family member in court and simply say i cant tell you anything about this family member you will have to find out for yourself here is another problem though not only are you impaired from getting diagnostic information you cant evaluate medications but understand that people with serious mental illness are often at high risk for other medical problems in part because their hygiene may be poor they may not take care of themselves may not see doctors et cetera but they also are in a situation where they may take some medications that make them high risk for diabetes or heart disease and without getting a family member to help them with that they do not have the ability to properly treat them my goal in this bill is to simply say that in cases where someone has diminished capacity to take care of themselves where in absence of treatment they become gravely disabled a provider may tell a known caregiverso notice i have already set the bar pretty highmay tell a known caregiver a few simple facts the diagnosis the treatment plan the treating doctors time and place of appointment and what are the medications they are on no therapy notes are allowed to be exchanged we specifically prohibit that in this bill but that is important and by the way i might add one other thing as i hear a lot of people talking about the concerns of why didnt a parent do anything why didnt they know anything in some cases like the young man at virginia tech who killed so many students or the gentlemen in oregon or at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut it is because providers cannot do a risk assessment they cannot contact a family member and say can you tell me if this person has any morbid fantasy and fascination with death with extremely violent video games with dark web sites do they have weapons that are unsecured do they talk about violent issues have they made threats before you cant do that risk assessment without that you end up not knowing the risk number seven states receive money for mental health services and substance abuse disorders those dollars are about 500 million for mental health and about 600 to 700 million for substance abuse the odd thing about this is states are not allowed to mingle that money they cant braid it together even worse is that many people with a substance abuse disorder have a mental illness and many people with mental illness will turn toward other substances to selfmedicate and yet the person will have to go to two different providers two different clinics to get care instead of one we drop that barrier and say federal grants should go to states in a way that help the states work this best number eight we want to bring accountability to the spending of federal funds now here is where we have seen in another gao report the absolute absurdity and cruelty of how money is spent a gao report done this last summer told us that many times documents and applications for many who receive grants were not reviewed they couldnt tell you what the application criterion was to get an award they didnt have programspecific guidance information was missing or not readily available they didnt even know where it was stored you couldnt follow the paper trail to see where it was and so what happens is no one knows how this money was spent but let me tell you some of the absurd things we have found money is spent on our tax dollars how about this a web site last winter was posted by samhsa for the people of boston to help them with their worries about snow that is right they posted a 1800 number you could call if you had snow anxiety these are people from new england for goodness sake they know how to handle snow but our tax dollars went to help them understand it there are web sites that tell you to drink a fruit smoothie if you are anxious programs that tell you how to make a mask programs that we fund to how to make collages a painting in samhsas headquarters that cost 22 500 of two people sitting on a rock surrounded by other people 22 000 when we asked the director of samhsa what that was for they said it is more mental health awareness the only thing i am aware of is it is a waste of money and that money could have gone to help pay someones salary to actually treat a patient well it gets worse a web site for 3yearold children the cost of 426 000 with animated characters and singalong songs the purpose we asked the director of samhsa prevention prevention of what we said well we think prevention is good well what does this prevent and what does it do and does it work and does it do anything we waited for weeks to get an answer and we still dont have it 1 month later by the way they took the web site down when we shined a bright light on it saying what does this do we want accountability to this spending there will be different grant programs nowdemonstration grants innovation grantswhere people will know what these grants are they can look at them as scientific studies in a blind review to make sure it is going to quality programs that really make sense no more of this behavioral wellness stuff but truly working at things that make a difference number nine develop alternatives to institutionalization and have real jail diversion i said already what happens to so many people with mental illness they end up in jail forty to sixty percent of people in prison have a mental illness and what this does is it helps provide some extra funding for states that have wraparound services for those who have this history of violent incarcerations arrests mental illness new york has a program called assisted outpatient treatment their program which means a judge will say you need to stay in treatment at an outpatient level has found they reduced incarcerations by 81 percent they reduced homelessness by over 70 percent they reduced admissions to emergency rooms by over 70 percent they had patient satisfaction consumer satisfaction at over 90 percent and they cut costs in half states have different programs here about 46 states have something on the books but many of these states do not put these programs in practice because of the big cost we know states will save a lot of money once they start doing this but what we want to do is take people out of this cycle this revolving door of jail and risk and more damage and say that states need to have programs where it wraps around services for that person dont just dump them from jail onto the streets and expect a problem because it will erupt again make sure those services are there make sure the person stays in treatment now some say well that is unfair some say that might be an involuntary commitment that it puts people there against their will and you impair their rights but i say this that a person with serious mental illness 40 percent of the time is not even aware they have a problem and so many times they refuse treatment or their past runins with the police and other hospitals because they dont want to be there they dont want to get treatment if we provide quality compassionate accessible care they may get that but not under the current system we want to make sure they have that care and we will provide the funding to do it number 10 advance early intervention and prevention programs a lot of what our government spends money on is what is called primary prevention the things we do for everybody like dont smoke wear a seat belt but what happens is in the area of mental illness those wellness programs like i described before that are out there the silly things that samhsa does are not an effective use of dollars secondary and tertiary prevention is valuable secondary is when you recognize someone is at risk but not with symptoms tertiary is when they have symptoms and you try and help them get better by focusing money on the programs i mentioned beforethe raise program or others the child and adolescent traumatic stress networkyou can move the dollars where they need to be funded and stop this silliness now i should say this while i am talking about samhsa that despite two gao reports that criticize themand one time afterwards i had the director of samhsa in my office and i said okay here is your opportunity would you change anything and she said no i wouldnt change a thing another time during one of our hearings one of my colleagues said on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate yourself on your programs and the director said i would give myself a 10 despite all these failures that is the reason why we need to have an assistant secretary of mental health that is the reason why we need to make these changes this is the current reason why we have so many of these problems before i wrap up here i want to yield a couple of minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania who has also been involved in the

community dialogue on this public health epidemic to discuss ways of treating and preventing addiction at every forum at every town hall at every business i visit at every hospital i visit i hear from my constituents of the devastation this epidemic is inflicting on our communities i hear tragic stories about friends or family members succumbing to heroin addiction i hear from medical workers and first responders about the strain this epidemic is placing on their resources i hear stories of pain and loss and i want to share a few of those with you to illustrate what i am talking about during the course of the six town halls i have conducted or have participated in throughout my district over the last several months we have routinely heard of the stories of victims in particular families have told of the loved ones they have lost one individual really caught my attention they all caught my attention but this one was pretty devastating morgan axe was a beautiful young woman and a great athletejust a great kid overallwho battled addiction with heroin for several years at 24 years old she became pregnant and she stopped taking heroin completely in order to protect her baby she stopped taking any drugs that would have helped her with her cravings and she was doing great at the fifth monthat 5 months of being cleana boyfriend thought it would be a good idea to give her a dose of heroin we have the telephone records to show it she took that heroin and she died as did her baby her mother had to come to that forum and talk about this i applaud her for the openness with which she talked about it for the pain that she shared with us and for the lessons that can be learned from this it can happen to anybody it is not an inner city drug when we were growing up we used to think of heroin users as individuals who would be under a bridge somewhere or in an alley but that is not the way it is it affects those in the suburbs the wealthy the poor and everyone in between i have one other quick story when i was renting my congressional office the individual who was showing me the office had a sad look in his eye he began to tell me the story about his daughter who was the final four mvp for the ncaa junior college lacrosse the year before she died of a heroin overdose because she got into heroin after that championship it is an epidemic with enormous consequences and it is getting worse the epidemic of addiction is claiming the lives from every age class and race like i mentioned i know that society doesnt like to talk about drugs addiction and overdose but this is a problem that we can no longer ignore and it is one that we must absolutely positively address the scourge must be stopped i am absolutely proud to be part of the house action that is being taken this week on several measures that will help to fight against this growing opioid epidemic and through the passage of my drug kingpin bill earlier today much remains to be done and i hope that congress will build on the actions this week and will continue to work on efforts in a bipartisan manner so we can fight back and save people from addiction"], [0.0014394521713256836, 0.4985605478286743, 1, "next week americans throughout the country will celebrate veterans day in cities and towns and hamlets which all of us come from we will take the time to thank and to honor those men and women who

september who i worked with closely and who were community leaders charlie waters and earl watson both gentlemen who exemplified what is the best and the brightest our nation has to offer earl watson or as many like to call him earl the pearl was a world war ii veteran after the war he moved to los angeles where he worked as a doorman in the famous hotel knickerbocker during a difficult time in our nations history during world war ii when segregation was still in many places the law of the land earl was most proud that he could serve his nation he wrote a biography titled earl the pearl watson doorman to the stars but what he was most proud of was his service to our nation earl loved people he had a big smile a friendly demeanor and an eagerness to help those in need anytime a veteran ever came to him or a veterans organization had a problem he was there to be helpful earl told me when we were able to retrieve his medals that he had earned during his service to our country that the proudest moment of all the many things he had done in his life was his service to our country earl is survived by his wife of 71 years melba his children alan and coleen and grandchildren eric ashley and jonathan who he was so so very proud of another veterans advocate who we all miss in the san joaquin valley is charlie waters who served in the united states marine corps during the korean war charlie as he was affectionately known by all never ever stopped fighting on behalf of veterans i worked closely with him for many years from working to get recognition for hmong veterans to advocating for the funding of the opening of the veterans home that we successfully did that provides residence to those who deserve it as a matter of fact in charlies last days he was able to stay there he was a true champion of veterans not only throughout the valley but the nation but he did not stop there supporting the veterans administration hospital in fresno and providing support for their efforts organizing and helping continue the veterans day parade which is one of the largest veterans parades in the entire nation that is shown on armed services television and individuals no problem was too big or too small as long as a veteran was there who needed charlies help therefore we miss both charlie and earl very much for all that they have done and all that they exemplified in terms of honor duty and service to country charlie is survived by his wife cathy and children charlie waters iii karen and jennifer we want to take this time to recognize those leaders those leaders who made a difference during their lives in serving our country they are both shining examples of those who alwaysalwayscared first and foremost for our nation as we celebrate veterans day next week

duty never ever forget to say thank you for their service to a grateful nation"], [0.0018537640571594238, 0.5018537640571594, 1, "i stand in support of the every student succeeds act i want to thank chairmen alexander and kline and ranking members murray and scott for their yearlong work on this bill at its heart the elementary and secondary education act is a civil rights law based on a simple yet powerful promise made to all american children it is a promise that no matter where you live what you look like or what resources you have you deserve a quality education unfortunately no child left behinds onesizefitsall approach derailed the fulfillment of this promise by creating an untenable environment of excessive highstakes testing that undermines educators ability to serve their students while not perfect the every student succeeds act is a substantial improvement that takes us one step closer to delivering on the promise of a quality education essa will provide schools with the resources and guidelines they need to deliver on this promise by directing resources to the children most in need and allowing school districts the flexibility to use title iv funds in a way that best works for their students as someone who has dedicated my life to dropout prevention i am overjoyed to see this bill includes my amendment allowing title iv funds to be used for dropout prevention

floor tomorrow and the process the committee used which was a series of hearings through the process supported by our chairman supported by members on both sides of the aisle i want to thank joe barton and mr cuellar of texas for their leadership in recruiting cosponsors a large bipartisan group of cosponsors to bring this longstanding bill to the floor and the positive efforts it will have on our economy i would like to say to my friend mr sessionsand i invite him to come to little rockthat i filled up last week for 1 82 so perhaps arkansas is a more competitive gas pricing market than even texas that may be the biggest economic news of the day here on the floor we have touched on the importance of american jobs all of our american jobs in the oil patch right now are suffering due to low prices and low development budgets i dont have any doubt that when reserves are revalued september 30 for our publicly traded companies their oil and gas exploration lines of credit will be down because of pricing in the unitedstates and therefore this is a boost for the economic opportunity for jobs in the united states in development i want to touch on the national security aspects of this bill that i think are so important early in the year this house passed ways to improve liquefied natural gas to be developed and shipped overseas to international markets we have an abundant amount of natural gas in this country we are now the worlds leading producer and we have the opportunity to provide natural gas in liquefied form around the world to our allies in asia and europe likewise eliminating the ban on crude oil long outgrown by north american production and our economic success will allow us to now from a national security point of view to have liquefied natural gas and crude oil as export potential and as economic job potential for the unitedstates but more importantly to our nato allies and to our asian allies we offer them north american gas and crude oil as an alternative to the mid east and most importantly europe to russia for too long our allies in europe have been held hostage by the politics of the mid east or the politics of russia this allows us to be a much better not only economic partner but national security partner with our allies in europe and our allies in asia i want to thank you for the opportunity to come to the floor and speak in strong support of this bill to remove the export ban on crude oil in the united states i urge my fellow members both democrat and republican to provide a good strong bipartisan vote and send that message to the united states senate to join us in passing this lifting of the ban and to send a message to white house that a veto message here is not appropriate i invite the president and the omb

to 2 million jobs over the next decade the key reason for the work reduction according to the cbo is healthcare subsidies which are tied to income which will raise effective tax rates for americans and will create a disincentive for people who are seeking promotions or new higher paying jobs the report also points to tax increases and penalties as a reason for the work reduction including the employer mandate which imposes penalties on those companies with more than 50 employees that do not provide insurance the house and the senate recently passed legislation that would repeal key parts
