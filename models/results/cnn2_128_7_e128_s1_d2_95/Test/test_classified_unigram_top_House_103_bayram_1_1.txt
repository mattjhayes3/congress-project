the answer i think the energy tax is bad policycounterproductive policy the waterway user fee increase is definitely bad policy but one of the tax proposals in the presidents proposal stands out above all the otfiers when it comes to unfairness and dishonesty and that is the presidents proposal to raise from 50 to 85 percent the portion of social security benefits that is taxable we are not talking about wealthy people here we are talking about individuals with incomes over u5 00 couples over 32 000 we are talking about people who managed to scrimp and save and put enough money away for his or her retirement years to have a modest income it is a retirement planning pen alty some people have criticized the presidents tax plan because it breaks his promise not to raise taxes on middle class america generally they point to the energy taxthe btu taxas the culprit because that tax is passed on to every consumer and every homeowner in the country but the proposal to raise taxes on social security benefits is the real broken promise the administration fudged their numbers enough to be able to say that 70 percent of the increased tax burden would fall on people with incomes over 9100 000 but 70 percent of the increased revenue from the social security tax increase falls on people with incomes well under 100 000 the presidents tax plan singled out millionaries people with incomes over 5250 000for that special 10percent tax surcharge but the social security tax increase does exactly the same for many people with incomes between 25 000 and 32 000 many of these middieclass retired folks will be hit with tax increases over 10 percent theyre not millionaires they arent even wealthy by most standards but many social security recipients will be hit with 10 ii 12 even

is another big problem with the social security tax increase not only does it penalize savings and investment it also breaks a sacred promise to social security recipients when the tax on social security benefits was enacted in 1983 the revenues were directed to the social security trust fund to insure its future solvency that was the purpose of the taxto keep the social security trust fund strong the administrations proposal does not do that the presidents proposal would divert the additional revenues to other measures we are talking about an outright raid on the social security trust fund the presidents proposal to increase taxes on social security benefits is an outrageous breach of faith to social security and senior citizens colleagues the social security tax increase is not

country fact no 2 of that 2 percent of the cattle industry that has enjoyed this subsidy for literally decades 2 percent of it control almost half the grazing lands in our country they do not

shred of verifiable evidence to support any accusations and objections that have been presented today it will not kill jobs it will not raise cattle prices hurt the environment destroy western

mining regulation when the cumbersome federal review and appeals process is ineffective states such as utah through state regulatory agencies and boards have often enforced permit and reclamation requirements on federal as well as nonfederal lands where shortage of staff and funding are common federal and state agencies through moas have designated a lead agency for permitting and inspection activities although federal regulation has not required financial assurance for reclamation of small five acres or less mining and exploration operations some states have enacted state statutory requirements for reclamation of all lands federal and nonfederal financial assurance is already required for larger operations and most states have moas with federal agencies to avoid duplicate bonding requirements 3 title ii federalizes the regulation of mining operations on federal lands and contiguous nonfederal lands there is no authority or role for state regulation under title u1

such agreements would also provide a framework for interagency coordination of financial assurance requirements inspections and enforcement actions 5 h 322 creates new requirements for federal
