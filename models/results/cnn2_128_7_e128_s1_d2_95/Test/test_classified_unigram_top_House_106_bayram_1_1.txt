you provide a service to the department of education you bill them and they pay you and they pay you again you get paid twice this year alone there have been 150 million of documented duplicate

have been paid twice closed shop and said hey this is a pretty good deal i think the other thing that we really do have is we have got a phenomenal education strategy to improve schools at the local

saying get the money out of washington out of this failed bureaucracy get it into a local classroom get it to a teacher get it to a teacher who knows our kids names we are saying get the money back to the local school district let them decide whether they need computers teachers teacher training whether they need construction or whatever but let local schools make the decisions as to how they are going to spend those dollars we have 760 programs you have to apply for each one of these programs it is a huge paperwork bureaucracy and we know the department cannot handle it get the money back into the local school district say we are going to make the investment but let you decide how to spend it get rid of the federal paperwork we know we have been in 20 states governors will come in and

"i stand in strong opposition to the passage of the 2001 labor hhs and education appropriations bill because it severely cuts programs that are extremely important to the education of our children and because it hurts displaced workers i urge my colleagues to oppose it the first problem with this gop bill is that it severely shortchanges education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable the root of these problems is that in order to pay for the proposed republican trilliondollar tax breaks for the

they have endorsed the coburnshadegg bill just as they have endorsed the other i can say we fall by the wayside when we reach about 200 endorsements the reason we do not reach the level of 300 that

yes those now famous phrases sue their hmo but it is done in an orderly fashion and guess what the trial lawyers do not endorse our proposal why because it is not open ended and it is not left up to a

section 3602 of the bill provides that the executive draft on federal transportation in the national capital region has been submitted to the office of management and budget and shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this bill the section further provides that within 60 days of enactment the secretary of transportation shall transmit to congress a report on implementation of the executive draft this provision would enact into law a policy that congress has not reviewed a policy in fact that is still in the process of being written by the administration although the latest version of the draft executive order referenced in section 3602 has not been made available we understand that it sets forth a variety of requirements for federal agencies in the national capital region in an effort to reduce the number of employees who drive alone to work we understand that the draft executive order would require federal agencies to develop and implement transportation management plans designed to reduce vehicle miles traveled by federal employees and various other requirements in addition the draft executive order would apparently require all agencies in the national capital region to provide maximum taxfree transit benefits to all employees this transit benefit alone is estimated to cost 60 million to 80 million each year for this region and would ultimately be extended to other regions across the country and be even more costly the cost of complete implementation of the policies set forth in the draft executive order may be far greater while some of these requirements may have merit they are nevertheless significant policy changes not only have no congressional hearings been held on the draft executive order its contents have not even

drug abuse the district i represent sits on the mexican border one of the crossings in my district is the busiest border crossing in the entire world so i have personal experience with the border and all the opportunities and challenges associated with border crossings there is no question that we must gain better control of our borders there have been herculean efforts by the immigration and naturalization service the customs service the drug enforcement agency the federal bureau of investigation and many other government agencies including state and local agencies all these agencies are to be commended for their efforts and dedication to controlling our borders and ending the illegal crossing of narcotics and narcotics smugglers and though much remains to be done i have serious and grave reservations about this proposal to literally arm the border yes we need to better control the border but placing armed military personnel on our borders who are trained to fight and win wars by killing people is not the answer the united states military is the best equipped best trained most disciplined and most efficient in the world our military can win any war that the american people choose to fight but the brave men and women serving in our armed forces win those wars by killing people as repulsive and unforgiving as killing is it is the way wars are won with people who are trained to kill other people patrolling our own border i fear for the safety of our own citizensnot from intent but from accident i also want to remind everyone that mexico is a friendly country they have made no attempts at invasion since the alamo accordingly i believe this proposal could do serious damage to a relationship that is fragile at best we must find new and innovative methods for stopping illegal drugs from coming into our country and killing our people but i do not believe arming the mexicanamerican border with the united states military is the best way i call on my

agree with me on that let me cite an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can qualify that may sound absurd but let us just say that the plan does that a little boy goes out a teenager tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill that plan followed its own criteria guess what under the boehner bill and under the bill that passed the senate there is no

be extended in increments of not more than 6 months the visa waiver program allows aliens traveling from certain countries to come to the united states as temporary visitors for business or pleasure without having to obtain b visas however a visit cannot exceed 90 days and no extensions are available the attorney general can authorize an alien admitted under the visa waiver program who faces an emergency situation to remain in the united states for 120 days beyond the initial 90day admission under voluntary departure while the 210day period provided by the initial 90day admission and the 120 days under voluntary departure is adequate to deal with most emergency situations it does not meet the need of a relatively few aliens who are admitted to the united states under the visa waiver program and are receiving longterm medical treatment h r 2961 would address this problem by establishing a 3year pilot program authorizing the attorney general to waive the 120day cap on voluntary departure for a limited number of patients and attending family members who enter the unitedstates under the visa waiver program the legislation contains safeguards to ensure only those truly in need of longterm medical care can obtain such a waiver an alien seeking a waiver would be required to provide a comprehensive statement from their physician detailing the treatment sought and the aliens anticipated length of stay in the united states in addition the alien and attending family members would be required to provide proof of their ability to pay for the treatment and their living

development assistance fund which is a fund that much of the appropriations for development assistance around the world is a very important instrument for development in africa the house has taken a step backwards by eliminating the earmark for the development fund for africa which was in legislation up until 1994 but we are not asking for the earmark to be replaced since it was removed but we are asking that 220 million be added into the development assistance fund which would fall under the development assistance fund for africa the dfa although we are not asking for the earmark now what i am saying is simply that during the 1990s 1993 and 1994 when the development from the dfa was designated we actually appropriated 850 million in 1994 804 million in 1993 so we had a continued increase in the development fund for africa the 1998 level was 700 million in 1999 it was approximately 700 million this year it has dropped to approximately 500 million so we are asking that 220 million be allocated within the development assistance to be earmarked for africa it seems as we have been talking about all of the problems in africa we have been talking about the aids pandemic we have been talking about the need for loan forgiveness it seems like it is a move in the wrong direction to reduce the development fund for africa the monies that are designated although not earmarked because these funds go to assist in famine prevention they go in to helping dialogue in countries to ward off ethnic strife they go into many very very important issues that help to make stable countries in africa i might mention that during the last decade about 85 to 90 percent of the nations in africa have gone under democratization we have had elections in practically every country many people have the misconception that there are dictators still in africa but that was in the past we have had elections in mozambique and in south africa we have had elections in namibia and kenya we have had elections in senegal we can go on and on and on so there is no longer these dictators who speak with the one voice i have talked earlier about the fact that we did have that problem in the past during the cold war where we created mobutu when we went and destabilized patrice lumumba and took him out of office with our united states intelligence operation and put in mobutu who of course supported the south african apartheid government of p w botha he supported ian smith in rhodesia who had the same sort of government he supported the southwest africa which did the same thing this was a mobutu that we put in because of the fact that it was during the cold war we can go on and on in africa but there have been elections in most countries we are looking for elections in the former zaire the democrat republic of congo in the future we have seen elections in most other countries so it seems to me that in order to alleviate poverty which is of course one of the great problems in africa in order to look at the anmount of funds that go into africa the population of africa is about 700 million people we are talking about 500 million less than a dollar a person in africa where we have seen other places around the world with much smaller populations getting billions of dollars so it seems to me that in order for us to look at africa 16 of the 18 of the poorest countries in the world are there while we are reducing the amount of funds available as i have indicated it is going against what we should been doing in this new millennium it is really not supporting new presidents who have been elected and are going through structural adjustments like in mozambique where they have had a growth in their gdp of about 10 percent annually as a matter of fact these countries different from what people believe that in the sadc countries which are 14 countries in south africa each of these countries has had an increase in their gdp from 4 to 12 percent even the country of botswana has had a balanced budget and has put more money in at the end of the day than it has spent so my appeal is that we increase the development fund for africa to put it to the levels that it

agency promotes health care quality through research synthesizing and consolidating medical information and disseminating scientific evidence building on its current initiatives the agency will play a key role in partnering with the private sector to improve the quality of health care in the united states as a longtime supporter of health care research i believe this piece of legislation will benefit patients caregivers and insurance providers with vital information and statistics on how to improve the nations health care system the agencys research and information consolidation will play a key role in extending quality care and improving health service delivery throughout the country this agency provides vital information and resources that foster improvement in health care systems from americas smallest rural townships to its most populous inner cities the agencys mission includes fostering the extension of quality health care systems to those americans left behind as our nation continues its economic growth the agencys work is especially important as health care delivery in our country evolves when the ahcpr was established a little over 10 years ago the health care system was vastly different from what we know today more people now receive their care through managed plans and hmos the growing complexity of health plans bewilderers many patients and contributes to the growing tensions between patients and insurers this legislation directs ahrq to address the publics growing concern for the quality of patient care and the number of medical errors that continue to grow each day their research helps hospitals and clinics around the country to reduce the injuries arising from mismanagement of cases a recent study examined the records of more than 30 000 hospital patients in my home state of new york the study found that nearly 4 percent of patients suffered serious injuries that were related to the management of their illnesses rather than the illnesses themselves this is a vital area of research for the agency and another reason why the reauthorization of funding for this agency and the redirection of its mission is important the legislation does more than merely change the name of the agency it directs the agency to develop new publicprivate partnerships in the health care arena this will bring new perspectives to improving the dissemination of health information and the development of health care systems that better serve our neighborhoods towns and cities these partnerships will also leverage greater private investment and commitment to creating improved health care service systems throughout the nation in the process ahrq will also support increased efficiency and quality of federal program management according to testimony provided to the committee during a recent hearing nine out of 10 people surveyed supported health research as well as the amount of federal money spent on our nations health care this agency costs just one onehundredth of one percent of the total funds spent by the government on health care and is a sound investment in our nations future health i support this initiative even though it is only a modest step toward guaranteeing that all our citizens have access to the finest medical care in the world citizens across the united states are crying out for more we need comprehensive health
