and a travesty of procedure we are being asked to vote blind unable to determine what this conference agreement means and what it would do in practical terms as late as noon today the staff of the subcommittee on housing was not able to get complete information on what this resolution would mean for housing programseven though housing is one of the most basic elements of the resolution and even though the housing sector is about the most hardpressed industry in the nation today what i have been able to learn about the meaning of this report is so disturbing that i can well understand why its sponsors want to bring it in under the cover of haste and secrecy it so brutalizes the poor so miserably fails to address the genuine needs of the nation of the economy or of simple crying human need that no one could say that it represents a budget of decency compassion or even elemental good sense with respect to housing i have been able to learn that the conference report gives us an illusion that there will be some new budget authority to construct additionl assisted housing unitsbut i stress that it is an illusion the conference agreement says that there would be some 10 4 billion in budget authority for assisted housing that gives the illusion of a program but the reality is something else when you examine budget authority against outlay authority you find that there is only 7 6 billion for outlayswhich in fact is 300 million less than would be needed just to fund existing commitments in other words you not only get no actual new construction ii137411 you get an absolute requirement to rescind a great deal of authority that now exists what is worse you get a requirement to cut operating subsidies for public housing by something like 400 million in outlays the meaning of that is that for purposes of calculating rent in public housing assisted housing food stamps would have to be counted as income by some slight of hand that which is not income suddenly becomes cash what was supposed to go for food suddenly must now go for rent what is more the resolution would require the rent increases that were assumed by grammlatta ii to be accelerated you get nothing for new starts for public housing you move housing authorities closer to bankruptcy and you inflict punitive new expenses on the people who live in public housingpeople who by and large have no means whatever of raising their incomes they simple are condemned to deeper misery by this conference report the resolution also would kill the programs that today pioduce decent housing for the poor people in rural america it would do this by making the subsidized interest rate in the rural programs rise by better than 400 percentup to 9v percent or more as against todays interest rate of 2 7 percent that change will make it impossible to continue making loans for housing to help poor families in rural areas they will simply have no way of making the payments that would become necessary even the middleclass

a bank vice president would find hard to manage similarly the bill would drastically raise the cost of the gnma tandem mortgage programagain killing a key source of reasonably priced mortgage money i

information for me to even know what i should know either as a subcommittee chairman or as a member of the house what i do know makes it clear that this report takes a bad situation and makes it worse

year a 3 million ton overproduction in the european economic community was dumped onthe world market and dropped prices by 50 percent unitedstates policyfor 40 years from 1934 to 1974 the unitedstates

in the farm bill being considered by congress is well below the local industrys production costs of around 20 cents a pound another aspect of the support price situation is the development of a

serious thinking in the months ahead of how much saving the sugar industry is worth to au uts for myself its quite a lot mfom the honolulu advertiser dec 12 1981 american sugar needs support to compreter by dr thomas k hitch the united states has not had an affirmative sugar policy since 1974 when the 1934 sugar act expired our sugar policy from 1934 to 1974 40 years was to have sugar prices stabilized in the american market by assigning marketing quotas based on unitedstates requir ements to domestic and foreign producers so that prices found a level that would be fair to both the american consumer and the american sugar producer since 1974with no sugar policythe price of raw sugar in the american market has been on a roller coasteras high as 65 cents in 1974 as low as 9 cents in 1976 as high as 44 cents in 1980 and now at about 16 cents the unitedstates beet and cane sugar producers cannot remain in business on a permanent basis with this kind of wild1ly fluctuating price levelwith two of the last eight years being boom years 74 and 80 one being barely profitable 1975 and the other five being deeply depressed years with tremendous losses even during these years the american consumer has not benefited because while there have been more years of cheap sugar than of dear sugar the price of sugar rose to such astronormical heights that it probably hurt the consumer more in those years than he has helped in the cheap years also when very high sugar prices push the price of randies ice cream soft drinks and baked goods up they tend to stay up after the price of sugar falls so that the american consumer to a certain extent lives with high sweetening prices even when sugar becomes cheap again to understand the world sugar market one has to realize that some 80 percent of the sugar produced in the world has a guaranteed home at a guaranteed price that prices in these countries do not fluctuate up and down with world under and overpro duction and that the socalled world price for sugar is set by demand and supply forces that affect only that 18 percent of the worlds sugar production that is uncommittedand therefore very cheap when world production is surplus and very dear when world production is short to put it another way all the major sugar exporting countries of the world have a government guaranteed set price for sugar boasumed in that country with the price set at a level that will make it profitable to grow sugar in such large quantities that it is a major export item this is truefor cuba brazil australik philippines south africa argentina india mexico and the eec as well as the rest of the smaller sugar exporting countries take the eec through its common agricultural policy cap european growers are not only guaranteed 27 cents a pound but are encouraged to produce excess sugar for export and in the last decade the eec has become a major exporter of subsidized sugar in contrast to having traditionally been a net importer of sugar european sugar is now being sold in large quantities in the unitedstates market when the price for raws is about 15 cents after paying shipping and insurance while the price in europe is 27 cents this situation is demonstrited by the fact that when the world sugar market price skyrocketed from about 10 cents a pound in 1973 to 65 cents a pound in 1974 there was no change in the domestic price of refined sugar in the countries that produced 60 percent of the worlds export sugar and only a modest change upward in the other export ing countrieswhile the price in the unitedstates more than doubled the same thing happened when world sugar prices fell furthermore most of the worlds sugar importing countries are buffered against fluctuations in this small but highly volatile world marketbuffered generally by longterm agreements with sugar exporting countries to provide them with a normal supply at a normal price this is shown by the fact that in that same period of rapid price rise 19731974 the countries that consumed 22 percent of all world sugar imports bad no change in the domestic price of sugar those accounting for 12 percent of world imports only a 1 to 15 percent rise and with only a handful of countries with the unitedstates being far and away the major one suffering from the full inflation of prices the socalled world sugar market being only a small fraction of world sugar production is a market where in periods of world sugar shortage the buyer pays exorbitant prices and where in periods of world surplus all homeless sugar is dumped if the unitedstates does not adopt a constructive sugar policy it will ultimately lose its domestic sugar industrywhich will be a considerable economic loss since among agricultural products sugar ranks tenth in terms of acreage fifth in terms of tonnage and sixth or seventh in terms of dollars to the farmer the unitedstates sugar industry will not be killed by cheap foreign sugar that is produced more efficiently than ours it will be killed by foreign sugar that is dumped into our market at either a loss to the producer or at a profit that is provided by subsidies from the government of origin unitedstates sugar production is probably among the most efficient in the worldjust like our production of wheat corn rice soya beans and many other agricultural products but it cannot live on a 12 cents or 15 cepits or even 17 cents per pound pricea price which incidentally is about the same as good top soil at your corner garden shop in short if the unitedstates were to require that foreign sugar not be allowed to be sold in the american market at a lesser price than it is sold for in the country of origin the unitedstates sugar industry would be profitable and have a long and successful life furthermore if we lost our domestic sugar industry the nation and its consumers would have to live with the roller coaster of the world sugar market and could even find itself facing an opeclike foreign sugar cartel since the top 13 sugar exporting nations ship about 80 percent of the sugar entering world tradenumbers much like those in the oil cartel finally if the unitedstates lost its domestic sugar industry it would face catastrophe in the event of war or major shipping interruptions let us remember that in such times sugar has always been about the first commodity to be rationed that napoleon developed the beet sugar industry when the british blockade stopped the flow of essential foreign sugar to europe and that all the countries of the world that protect their domestic sugar industries do so primarily because of these strategic considerations lets get an affirmative unitedstates sugar policy before it is too late"], [0.056349944323301315, 0.056349944323301315, 0, "today our work is almost finished for the past 6 months we have labored mightily on a task of unprecedented importance to the wellbeing of our nation today we can put the capstone of our efforts into place by approving the administrations bipartisan tax package and by giving this administration a chance to do that which the voters asked itand usta do last november my decision to support the bipartisan tax package came only after a long and thorough scrutiny of the facts of the situation i kept my options open until all cards had been laid on the table and in the end i decided to support the administrations plan for several key reasons first the acrosstheboard cuts in marginal income tax rates and the timely removal of present tax penalties on investment income will generate badly needed savings among middle and higher income earners second the bipartisan package will increase the takehome pay of all workers over a 3year period while easing the burden of inflation third the plan through accelerated depreciation will generate more cash flow for industry and will stimulate increased development in newer more productive plants and equipment finally the bipartisan plan recognizes the contribution of small businesses to our economy and it includes several measures to strengthen their position the turning point in my deliberations over this crucial vote however came when i saw that the administrations proposal is the best plan for the average american worker and hence the people of my home state of maine and the northeast region of the country all of us have been inundated with information on this facet of the taxcut bills and we have heard each side proclaim its bill as the friend of the worker this aspect is important to my constituents because theyare by and large hard work~ers who earn only moderate incomes with this in mind i studied the two plans before us today i saw that social security increases under president carter and inflationfueled tax bracket creep will total about 22 percent for the average family in the next 2 years i then saw that the democratic plan calls for only 15 percent in tax cuts during that period an amount which will not cover these builtin hikes i asked myself if i could in good conscience tell my constituents that i had voted them a tax cut after supporting the democratic plan and i determined that i could not i also heard the claims from the other side of the aisle that their tax cuts are directed toward moderateincome groupsthose with average incomes between 10 000 and 50 000 per year under the administrations package this income bracket which now pays 72 percent of the personal income taxes collected by the federal government will receive 74 percent of the tax cut savings i find this equitablemuch more equitable than tax increases of 400 billion forced on the american people over the last 10 years while we simultaneously gave lip service to five socalled tax cuts one source of particular pride to me concerning the administrations bill is the fact that my colleagues and i on the small business committee were able to give muchneeded assistance to small business through this legislation we hear so much about big business in this day and age that we often forget the importance of small business to our society our nations 18 million small businesses are a leading source of jobs innovation investment and savings in our economy they account for 60 percent of existing employment 80 percent of new jobs and half of all industrial innovation numbers like these cannot be ignored and the administrations bill does not neglect them the bipartisan package increases equipment writeoffs for small business to 10 000 by 1986 it increases tax credits for the purchase of used equipment it raises the limits of taxexempt accumulated earnings from 150 000 to 200 000 per year finally it increases the allowable number of stockholders for small corporations from 15 to 25 also i am extremely pleased that the hanceconable tax plan includes a 15percent tax credit for woodburning stoves which is not included in the ways and means bill since woodburning stoves are widely used in the state of maine it will provide the financial incentive necessary for individuals to install woodburning stoves the tax credit will also serve a demonstration of support by the federal government for the effectiveness of woodburning stoves as an energy alternative in reducing the nations consumption of oil the maine people should be commended for their efforts in significantly conserving their usage of home heating oil finally it is truly unfortunate that we were forced to include a wide variety of extraneous provisionssocalled sweetenersto satisfy the special interests of this country it is too bad that we could not be voting today on a clean tax billone that was aimed solely at giving the american people a long overdue tax break but that is the nature of the legislative process and the administrations proposal is certainly the best one before us today i must also confess that certain provisions in both tax bills before us today tempted me to vote against all tax bills i am speakinig of the provisions included in both bills to provide tax reductions for the oil industry some of us supported a rules change to lift the oil industry cuta out of todays bill and to show them the light of day but our efforts were rejected it is unfortunate that in order to give our people a muchdeserved tax break we also had to capitulate to special interests and simultaneously give the oil companies a tax break we ignored the fact that oil companies already receive extensive special tax provisions in our laws we ignored the reality that oil companies would receive the general business tax breaks included in these bills we ignored the recent astronomical price hikes and profits of oil companies and instead we camouflaged more breaks for big oil into a forest of tax

5536 would authorize a feasibility study of the prairie bend unit in central nebraska the prairie bend project was originally proposed in 1976 it would provide direct irrigation water for approximately 70 000 acres in central nebraska and will also help to recharge local ground water tables in an additional 136 000 acres of an area which has suffered some of the most significant declines of any area of nebraska in recent years the project enjoys overwhelming local support and the support of the governor of nebraska the nebraska natural resources commission the interagency water coordinating committee and the entire nebraska delegation in the unitedstates house of representatives similar legislation has been introduced in the senate and is included in the omnibus feasibility study bill which is currently awaiting consideration in that body funds for commencing the feasibility study in fiscal 1983 are expected to be included in the energy and water appropriation measure to be considered later this year the study would develop and assess multiobjective alternatives to irrigate up to about 70 000 acres of land using water from the platte river stabilize ground water in an area of about 136 000 total acres provide outdoor recreation maintain and enhance habitat for waterfowl including the endangered whooping crane enhance the quality of ground water and other beneficial uses the study would evaluate the availability of water resources in the area for all beneficial uses and the physical and economic feasibility of alternatives the prairie bend unit is located in a predominately agricultural area with several ruralorientated towns the closest large metropolis is grand island nebr a city of over 30 000 population private well irrigation development has resulted in declines in ground water levels causing increased pumping lifts operating costs and energy use some of the area and towns are experiencing deteriorating ground water quality and are having to seek other locations for wells for domestic and municipal uses pumping may be affecting the wet meadow complexes which are necessary habitat for the endangered whooping cranes and other migratory water fowl also some of the creeks and drains in the area experience frequent flooding development of a multipurpose project would maintain a reliable irrigation economy by means of conjunctive use of ground and surface water provide flood protection assist in maintaining desired habitat for migratory birds including the sandhill and whooping cranes and other wildlife

nebraska to divert a portion of the platte river in the offseason for irrigation and offstream storage they have held numerous meetings within the area and have obtained overwhelming local support i would like to point out that this bill has the support of the administration and the bureau of reclamation has expressed its willingness to move forward with the study as soon as funds are made available the potential effects of actual construction of the prairie bend project upon the habitat of the sandhill cranes and the endangered whooping crane is an important issue the area downstream from the proposed project area is a prime habitat of these graceful and magnificent birds and of course any adverse impact upon that area must be given the most serious consideration before any project can be authorized in fact during committee consideration of this bill i supported an amendment to specifically require a detailed study of those effects even though i was confident that the environmental impact statement associated with the feasibility study would do so in the absence of such an amendment one particular aspect of the bill the costsharing arrangement by which the local sponsoring agencies have agreed to accept a substantial portion of the cost is a significant step for the congress to take in authorizing feasibility studies for water projects the willingness of the potential beneficiaries to bear that cost is indicative of the strong support in the local area and will serve as an example for future project sponsors that they will henceforth be expected to contribute to meeting the cost of these projects and the associated studies the adoption of this bill by the house as well as the previous bill marks the dawning of a new day in water resource

repositories authorized by this bill will be subject to pervasive and comprehensive federal regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission and by the environmental protection agency i believe that an exchange of letters with the department of energy which i will include in another section of the record gives valuable guidance and direction to the action on how to carry out that regulation in a

new federal agency nothing could be further from the truth the section of the bill that gives rise to this type of talk is a section that says instead of as was in the original bill the federal government accepting the responsibility accepting title to nuclear waste at the repository site we should accept it at the reactor site now that conjures up all kinds of ideas that because we are going to accept title to the waste at the reactor site that we must form a federal agency that is how some people think we can or we should however it would be no different the same people that would transport it for the private utilities if they owned it would be the same people that could transport it for the federal government we do all kinds of jobs on a contract basis as a matter of fact it would be a lot better to take title to it at the reactor site because at least we have someone to take a look at it instead of havingwe have 70 reactorshaving 70 trucking companies all over the

requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and

last word i rise in support of the congressional black caucus substitute amendment the decisions which this house will make on the matter of the budget resolution for fiscal year 1982 will be the most important decisions of the 97th congress the type of budget resolution which will soon be adopted by this body will in a large measure determine the future course of this nation this administration contends that the american people on november 4 1980 gave ronald reagan a mandate to reduce federal spending cut taxes and slow inflation op february 18 1981 the president reacted to this socalled mandate by producing perhaps the most revolutionary budget document which this nation has ever seen the budget revealed by the presidentnow embodied in the grammlatta substituteprovides millions more for the most prosperous in our nation while pennies are taken away from the poor in the name of 1econamic recovery the budget revealed by the president would pad the pentagon with over 50 billion in new money for ships and other weapons for which we lack the skilled manpower to build and operate in the name of national security the administration budget would take away a 46cent meal from a food stamp recipient household or a ceta job from a high school dropout in the name of reducing inflation it is hard for me to understand the nature of a mandate in which a cold and callous insensitivity for the poor the disadvantaged the handicapped the elderly and the unemployed in our society is disguised as maintaining a social safety net for the truly needy to this date no one in this administration has yet defined this illusory term truly needy i do not believe that the american people mandaited the dismantlement of government by thiq means indeed ihe cbc has met the president headon by accepting his challenge to propose measures which offer a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden most importantly the cbc substitute accomplishes the economic goals which president reagan purports to address except that we do it with humaneness and compassion our substitute offers a greater chance for addressing the economic ills of this nation time and time again we have heard administration officials members of congress and bureaucrats recite how federal deficit spending causes inflation yet the administration budget or grammlatta substitute provides for a huge 50 billion deficit while the congressional black caucus does not subscribe to the tenet that a deficit creates inflation the cbc substitute amendment provides for a 7 85 billion surplus in fiscal year 1982 in a fiscally sound manner the cbc substitute offers the taxpayers a greater chance by rejecting the reagan administration tax cuts under the reagan plan 19 percent of the taxpayers with iincomes of 30 000 and above receive 61 percent of the tax relief while the 63 percent of the taxpayers with incomes below 20 000 receive only 18 percent of the tax relief the cbc rejects this economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich our substitute takes bold new steps toward innovative and comprehensive tax reforms our substitute offers the largest and fairest tax cut for the working poor and the middle class by increasing the standard deductiontaken by 60 percent of american taxpayersby indexing the tax code to control bracket creep and by increasing the earned income tax credit our substitute provides for a different approach to business incentives to stimulate capital formation and productivity by adopting a firstyear capital cost recovery system for business which has been endorsed by fortune magazine the new york times and the public interest tax research group our substitute generates ovvr 44 billion in additional revenue by ending wasteful and unproductive tax subsidies andl loopholes which only add to the federal deficit the cbc substitute offers the nation a greater chance by reflecting compassion and concern for our most precious resourcethe american people somewhere in the budget slashing hysteria we have forgotten that the people are the most important resource that we have we have forgotten that our government is here to serve the peopleall the people in this nation somewhere along the line we have gotten lost in a maze of cold statistics and numbers and percentagesforgetting about the human experience that lies beyond those numbers you forget that we live in a nation where government supposedly exists of the people by the people for the people i hope that before the final vote on this budget resolution that you will take the opportunity to walk the streets and see the multitude of our young people who are out of work contrary to some myths this is not because they do not want to work but rather because they lack the training and the opportunities to gain meaningful employment the caucus substitute may mean the difference between thousands of young people wasting their lives away or a cadre of young people who will have the basic skills to obtain productive employment i hope that befljre the final vote on this budget resolption that you will go grocery shoppipig with a welfare mother on food stamps you might get a vivid picture of how difficult it is for the 22 million americans on food stamps to purchase nutrtional food for a family on a limited budget the grammlatta substitute would take away nickels and dimes from food stamp benefits when pennies may make the difference for a poor food stamp recipient under our substitute a welfare mother on food stamps will not have to choose between eggs or milk or between bread or butter as members of congress you and i know that we get free medical care right here in this capital or in bethesda naval hospital other americans are not privileged to the best doctors for free it is in recognition of this type of reality that the cec substitute provides a full 75 1 billion for health care spending let me elaborate in this area a bit currently over 28 million elderly persons receive health care under medicare the elderly are sick more frequently and for more prolonged periods of time than the rest of the population of every 100 persons age 65 and over 80 suffer some kind of chronic ailment 10 suffer from impaired vision and 17 have hearing impairment sixteen of every one hundred persons age 65 and older are hospitalized one or more times annually the elderly require three times as many days of hospital care every year as persons under the age of 65 for most of our senior citizens illness strikes most often and with greatest severity at the time in life when incomes are most limited millions of our older citizens cannot afford the health care that they need it is a sad commentary on our society when many of our aged are forced to choose between seeing a doctor or getting a prescription filled or whether they will spend the money for food or warmth the cbc substitute protects funding for medicare since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 life expectancy of all races and sexes has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased clearly the medicaid program has helped nevertheless 23 million black americans still endure poorer health care higher death rates lower life expectancy and a reduced sense of wellbeing than the white population the shocking fact is that only half of the poor people in this country are eligible for medicaid benefits thirteen million children are supposed to receive physical checkups medical and dental care under medicaid yet 1 out of 3 american children has never seen a dentist one in seven has no access to regular health care the caucus substitute protects medicaid benefits for the poor andsick in our society under the grammlatta substitute which incorporates a cap on medicaid spending many states if not most would have to slash medicaid eligibility and benefits in fact many states are already doing so our nation leads the world in terms of biomedical research in fiscal year 1981 we will spend over 3 billion for this purpose yet we still do not have adequate treatment for cancer we have not found a way to cure diabetes we do not know how to prevent a myriad of diseases which cripple and debilitiate our people our substitute protects funding for these important research activities millions of americans suffer from the wrenching problems of mental illness alcohol and drug abuse a presidential commission on mental health acknowledged and lamented the fact that we have neither adequate services or trained manpower to properly treat these problems our substitute aussumes that we at least maintain current levels of spending for mcntal health services research and training minorities are severely underrepresented in the health professions for example blacks comprise fewer than 3 percent of lhe nations physicians and dentists and pharmacists less than 4 percent of podiatrists less than 1 percent of veterinarians and optometrists the cbc substitute provides funding for the federal programs which were designed to address thes~e fundamental inequities let me say that the bottom line is that the ci3c substitute meets the human capital needs of this nationin health education employment income security science and technologybetter than any other proposal before you the caucus substitute offers proof that the budget can be balanced goveminent spending decreased our national security maintained and tax relief granted without harming those less fortunate in our society who depend upon federal social programs a vote for the caucus substitute is a vote for america"], [0.9476158022880554, 0.9476158022880554,

80 if health care costs continue to inflate as they have been with regard to the allegation that there would be some increase in the coinsurance provision for home health care there is no coinsurance provision at all now so it would not be increased but we would require the implementation of a 5percent coinsurance factor for the first time bearing in mind that home health care is tho only item

encourages greater management control of contracting out practice~s at our military bases and installations historically since about 1955 the executive branch has supported and even encouraged the agencies to use the private sector to the maximum extent possible in 1966 the office of management and budget omb issued guidelines to be used by the executive branch in determining whether a particular activity should be performed by a private contractor these guidelines are outlined in 0mb circular asimply stated the guidelines require that a cost comparison of the agencys cost versus contractors cost be made before a decision to contract out any commercial or industrial type functions examples of the types of commercial and industrial functions which have been contracted out a military bases are security guard services aircraft maintenance and refueling sei vices motor vehicle maintenance operation of ammunition depots custodial services selected commissary services and medical equipment maintenance services the committee continues to be increasingly concerned about the advisability of contracting out activities at our defense installations and the potential for adversely impacting readiness furthermore the committee received information that suggests there mayhave been cases where the department has used contract services to circumvent civilian personnel ceilings in order to insure that contracting out would have l minimum effect on readiness last year the congress placed additional management and reporting requirements on the department of defense as outlined in the fiscal year 1981 defense authorization act these requirements were intended to prevent the department from using contract services to circumvent civilian ceilings however as importantly the bill directs the secretary of defense to report to the congress any intention or decision to contract out commercial or industrial activities during testimony on the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill witnesses indicated that in some cases performance by the contractor has been less that acceptable when this occurs it adversely affects the ability of both the base and unit commander to accomplish their missions one of the military witnesses indicated that contracting out in some cases would effect unit readiness as an example if a contractor who is contracted to perform vehicle maintenance or aircraft maintenance fails to perform this clearly effects unit readiness it is clear that contracting out may have an adverse effect on unit readiness however i would

the consideration of the housesenate agreement on the bill the nuclear waste disposal legislation this is an unusual rule and i should explain the parliamentary situation the senate passed a nuclear waste bill 8 1662 on april three house bills however were initially referred to four committees and sequentially to four other committees the bills were involved in considerable controversy because of differing interests of the large number of committees aria the concerns of members representing candidate states for nuclear waste facilities the house was unable to finally pass the bill until december 2 even after passage the house was faced with additional difficulties since the senate bill contained a provision s 1662 section 603 clearly within the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means for revenue measures the committee on rules properly could not provide for a motion to go to conference on the senate bill likewise even if a conference could have been fashioned within the constitutional constraints the legitimate jurisdictional claims of eight house committees and three senate committees would have made it impossible for a conference committee to act within the timeframe of the impending adjournment of the congress faced with these difficulties the managers for the two bodies have negotiated an agreement that protects the positions of each house they have worked in close consultation with members and committees who have vital interests in the bill in virtually every important respect the process by which the matter is placed before the house today represents the full equivalent of a conference report the senate amendment is a prenegotiated text the senate has included nothing which was not accepted by house managers the rule takes up that text and concurs clearing the compromise for the president neither i nor the members who have managed this measure for the house are completely satisfied with every provision but it must be recognized that it would be impossible to deal with such a complicated and controversial bill without dissent certainly the agreement does not meet all of my personal preference for a sound nuclear waste policy however i wish to point out that the negotiators have agreed to restore the rules committee amendments the amendments guarantee that a state can object to the siting of an awayfromreactoraprfacility or to the siting of a repository a state objection would be absolute unless overturned by action of both houses of congress this amendment significantly strengthens the bill if the department of energy or any successor organization which may be established develops a sound and fair siting process and a state objection is clearly political there is little doubt that congress would vote to permit construction but equally it is clear that congress will not intervene if an inadeaquate or unfair program is established a strong state veto insures a comprehensive fair and responsible siting process the strength of the state veto proposed here places an enormous responsibility on the department to seek and on the congress to enact any legislative improvements suggested by our early experience with the nuclear wasfe program i do not want to claim that the rules committee amendments are the total solution to the nuclear waste issue but i do believe their acceptance balances any

expedited handling of this matter in the other body the committee is aware that the senate substitute washandled on the floor under a 15minute time agreement the managers for the senate attempted to resolve the difficult matter of establishing a legislative history by submitting statements and colloquies for subsequent printing in the record for this reason the committee proposes to be as

attention of my colleagues the serious threat to federal student assistance caused by the reagan administrations refusal to process pell grant applications for the coming academic year we are all aware of the importance of the pell grant program in providing basic grant assistance to college students from low and middleincome families the processing of pell grant applications by the department of education is not only essential if these basic grant awards are to continue but colleges and universities across the country will be unable to calculate their own financial aid awards until pell grant determinations are complete i should stress that the issue at hand now is not the level of funding for the pell grant program regardless of what level of funding the congress approves for student aid grants the law provides a method for reducing grant awards in the event of less than full funding of the pell grantprogram yet without any clear statutory authority the administration has halted processing of student aid applications and is pursuing alternative regulations for the program i can only view the administrations actions in failing to consider pell grant applications in a timely fashion as irresponsible and grossly insensitive to the needs of students and their families the administration has ignored the law in carrying out its administrative responsibilities and is now approaching a point at which it may in effect freeze student aid funds which have been lawfully appropriated by the congress our memories must not be so short that we forget the lessons of a decade ago which led to prohibitions against the impoundment of appropriated funds by the president the administration certainly should pursue its budget proposals through the established budget and appropriations processes it must not anticipate or reverse congressional action by unilaterally bringing the student aid program to a halt i warn my colleagues in the house that the administration is on the verge of a serious breach of the legislative process which will have a dramatic impact on students if the processing of pell grant applications does not resume in the very near future the complex student assistance structure at our colleges and universities will begin to disintegrate and students will have no way of knowing whether they will receive sufficient financial aid to allow them to attend college i cannot believe that the administration wishes to encourage a confrontation with the congress on this issue at a time when it is attempting to work in a bipartisan fashion to shape an effective response to our present economic problems i strongly urge my colleagues in the house to voice their concerns regarding this serious threat to the student aid program and to join me

reduce the prestudent amount of the participating schools the perstudent amount has fallen steadily each year since the program started further continuing reductions would seriously threaten the
