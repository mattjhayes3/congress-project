600 000 blacks out of work in south africa that translates into about 3 5 million blacks in the not too distant future going to bed without food in their stomachs because they do not have a welfare program over there to take care of the unemployed or their families so the sanctions that we passed are going to hurt the very people we wanted to help now many of the leaders who supported sanctions in the first place are having second thoughts during the debate over the sanctions bill i had 12 black south african young people very well educated very articulate in my office during the day of the debate on final passage in the senate during that debate i asked many leaders of the senate on the foreign relations committee to talk to these young people and i could not get anybody to give them an audience particularly the leaders on that committee i think that is really tragic becafise we should have taken a longer look at what we were doing because it is going to work a hardship unless we repeal those sanctions the black leaders we talked to them the black leaders we talked to today said that if you really want to help the plight of the blacks in south africa and end apartheid there should be more investment not less there should be more businesses going to southern africa to be relocated in the black townships instead of having those companies leave south africa if we have those companies go over there and create black entrepreneurships more jobs for the black community that wil help create more economic clout on the part of the blacks and that economic power will translate into political power and that will help bring about an end to apartheid chief buthelisi bishop lekanaya and bishop mokena who represent about two4hirds of the blacks in south africa agree on this point i believe personally and i think the people who testified some of them today felt that sanctions that were passed in this body and in the other body last year not so much because it was really going to help the situation in south africa but more because of american civil rights considerations rather than solving the problems of apartheid in that country my feeling is if that was the case that justice weeps when politicians put political considerations above what is right and just the people in south africa particularly the blacks who have suffered under apartheid and who are now

part of our ability to defend ourselves will be the c17 airlifter i should note that this position was borne out in a recent study by the general accounting office which interestingly enough was requested by opponents of the c17 the gao analysis called the air forces decision to move to a new cargo airlifter to be justified and correct that view has been endorsed by the armed services committee at both the subcommittee and committee level the short of it is the c17 will meet our airlift demands into the 21st century and it will do so in an efficient and cost effective manner the c17 will have many capabilities now lacking in the old c5s it will be both an inter and intratheater plane and will require far less personnel to operate according to the air force the cost of flying a c17 will be far less than the c5 and this will result in savings of at least 16 billion over the life of the program while i can understand the position of the gentleman from georgia i believe the responsible thing to do is to defeat his amendment quite simply we need to modernize our airlifting capabilities and the best way to do so is through the c17 airlifter"], [0.49681711196899414,

to save 86 million the bill we just passed mandates that we do that by cutting the price support wed have to cut it about 1 11 since the price support forms the basis for wholesale milk prices all

us an amendment now and two amendments which are about to be offered which are frankly some of the most extreme amendments that have been offered on this subject at any time that the congress has been considering this issue of central america i think that it is accurate to say that this amendment is to a certain extent a more honest portrayal of the administrations agenda in nicaragua than we have sometimes seen from the administration itself i share with my friend the gentleman from california the commendation of my other friend and colleague from california the gentleman from california mr dornan1 for stripping away some of the veneer of the administrations argument because in fact this amendment comes very very close to an agenda that many people in the administration have led for some time an agenda of pursuing actual belligerency against the government of nicaragua that is unnecessary it is inappropriate it is counterproductive and it flies in the face of the policy that this nation ought to be pursuing in central america this is a nation that ought to be pursuing a policy of diplomacy and not a policy of military activity yet this amendment would strip away whatever veneer continues to exist of the appearance of diplomacy in administration policy i think that we have generally abandoned diplomacy and have looked to a military solution rather than a diplomatic solution in the region and that is a tragedy it is a tragedy we have compounded time and time again and one which we have pursued in regard to our policy in central america at least this amendment would recognize that reality but it is a reality that would undermine american participation in the region it would undermine the opportunity to achieve a diplomatic solution in the region it would also undermine any opportunity for peace in the region and it would clearly undermine the courageous efforts being pursued at this time by president arias of costa rica to achieve a diplomatic and peaceful solution in central america so i think that this amendment helps to spell out the type of ideological zeal and the type of ideological purity that we have heard discussed during the irancontra hearings and that has motivated people such as oliver north in their policies with regard to the region 0j 1645 it is a bad policy it is a bad suggestion and it is one that would simply get us mired further in a direction that we should do everything we can to reverse i would like for one moment to address the next two amendments as well we will be talking about them when they are raised

intelligence oversight act of 1987 this legislation is a crucial step in restoring the bond of comity and confidence between the congress and the executive branch concerning intelligence matters and in ensuring that this nations vital intelligence activities are conducted wisely efficiently and legallyand are supported by the american people the comity and confidence to which i referand which the drafters of the 1980 oversight act knew would beso important in implementing the provisions of that statute have been largely dissipated by actions of the current administration many of these actions were related to the irancontra affair but others preceded it and it has been clear to the intelligence committees for several years that the administration did not wish as the law requires to keep the intelligence committees fully and currently informed of intelligence activities the legislation which i cosponsor today will make it clear that there is no legal underpinning for such a position it will rebut a tortured and facile interpretation of existing statutory december 18 1987 r 11893 and constitutional law recently promulgated by the department of justice it makes clear that presidential findings which in almost all cases must be in writing must precede any covert action that such findings apply to all covert actions whether conducted by the cia or any other unitedstates government entity that such findings cannot retroactively ratify previously conducted covert actions that requests to other governments or third parties to engage in covert activities on behalf of the united states are to be treated as if the united states was directly involved and that the intelligence committees or the gang of eight leadership group in rare cases must be given prior notice of all covert actionswith an exception of not more than 48 hours after a finding is approved in rare circumstances when the president determines the national security requires that he take action before the committees or gang of eight can be notified unfortunately the administration opposes the prior notice provision in hearings conducted by my subcommittee on legislation the state department the cia and some former intelligence officials prophesized disaster if the intelligence committees had to be given prior notice of covert actions yet that enactment of the oversight act of 1980 prior notice has been afforded of all covert actions except for the one that did result in disaster the arms sales to iran the administration also claims that the prior notice provision is unconstitutional in my opinion the administration is wrong the congress through its powers of the purse can condition its appropriations in any manner it sees fitunless such a condition directly interferes with the exercise of a power textually committed solely to the president by the constitution this bill contains no such interference and by permitting up to a 48hour delay in notice to congress when time is of the essence it insures that the president can sufficiently exerdse his constitutional duty to defend the nation i would note that others who study these matters more often than i also believe this legislation to be clearly constitutional in its deliberation on this bills predecessor h r 1013 the intelligence subcommittee heard from prof lawrence tribe of harvard law school prof louis henken of columbia law school and prof william van allstyne of duke law school each of these constitutional scholars saw no constitutional problem with the prior notice provision the proposed legislation permits the president in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the united states to give the required prior notice to the limited gang of eight leadershipgroup rather than to the two intelligence committees yet this is not enough for the administration it contends that some activities of the unitedstates government are too sensitive to report even to the leaders of the two parties in the house and senate if the congress is to play its legitimate constitutional role in the areas of intelligence oversight and foreign policy formulation it cannot accept this argument the congress does have a need to knowa need demonstratively more crucial than that possessed by the dozens of foreign officials arms dealers and nsc staffers who were privy to the irancontra covert action congress needs to know about covert action for oversight purposes and it needs to know prior to their initiation for consultation purposes especially in cases such as the iran covert action where significant foreign policy issues are involved and where consultation with the intelligence committees takes the place of public and congressional debate clark clifford noted this week in testifying on similar legislation before the intelligence committee of the other body one of the principal shortcomings of the irancontra affair was the failure of the president to notify the intelligence committees of the governments activities the oversight process could have served a significant salutary purpose giving the president the benefit of the wisdom of those who are not beholden to him but beholden like him directly to the people and prepared to speak frankly to him based on their wide varied experience had the president taken advantage of notifying congress he and the country may well have avoided tremendous embarrassment and loss of credibility i fully agree with mr clifford this legislation is needed to insure a healthy oversight process and to insure that this nations intelligence activities promote rather than hinder the nations foreign policy objectives i urge my colleagues to support it and trust that it can be enacted early in the next session"]], "top_unsure":

were forced on this subcommittee in this general debate and during the amendment process i hope the members listen carefully and appreciate the rationale behind the committees recommendation the committee has presented the house with a responsible bill its within the budget allocation for both outlays and budget authority however for some very good reasons the committee has recommended spending 842 million more than the amount appropriated last year for discretionary programs oier the past several weeks the socalled shadow group has raised a very legitimate question during the consideration of appropriations bills theyve asked the committee and the house if our goal is deficit reduction how can we keep on spending more than last year well ive always felt that each case should be considered on its merits and the treasury bill as presented here today can be justified on its merits in general terms there are two reasons why this bill provides more spending this year than the amounts appropriated in fiscal year 1987 first the president presented the congress with unrealistic budget cuts in the middle of our war on drugs the budget proposed a 130 million cut for the customs service the budget proposed the elimination of the revneue forgone program the subsidy for nonprofit groups and rural newspapers i havent spoken to anyone in this house who agrees with this reduction and the president proposed no funds for the operation of our national defense stockpile he proposed to use money from the transaction fund a move prohibited by existing law a second reason for the increase is a direct result of the presidents budget about 90 percent of the increase in this bill can be attributed to increases requested by the president the presidents budget proposed an 11percent increase for the financial management service an 8 3percent increase for the mint a 9percent increase for the secret service a 21percent increase for the bureau of the public debt and a 14percent increase for the irs that increase alone amounts to 627 million its clear that the committee was faced with unpleasant choices unrealistic budget cuts and increases requested by the president forced this bill over the fiscal year 1987 level i urge the members to consider the reasons why spending was increased and if anyone has a better plan please come down to the floor and justify it the subcommittee hashed this bill out for days and there are not very many acceptable alternatives finally i will include for the record the administrations position on this bill needless

national training center for prison drug rehabilitation program personnel is duplicative and contains inappropriate organizational structures the department of justice already has two federal law enforcement training centers in glencoe ga and marianna az and is building a third in artesia nm the federal training centers are responsible for basic training of correctional officers and could be a possible already existing vehicle for drug rehabilitation training in addition the bureau of prisons has facilities in denver and dallas which already have inhouse drug rehabilitation training programs for prison officials they also send people to classes for such training finally the idea of giving the national institute of corrections the responsibility for a national program would be detrimental to their purposes i realize that nic supports the provisionsure they would like to have a new permanent facility and i am sure all of us would like to have it in our district but the fact of the matter is that nic is set up to respond to the needs of state and local prison officials they are small and effective if the change nics mission to a federal one even in this area then we are putting them in jeopardy of becoming bureaucratically bogged down the bottom line is that although this provision is backed by good intentions it is an ineffective and inefficient use of taxpayers money there are less costly ways to train prison officials to deal with drug rehabilitation as i pointed out earlier using already existing federal facilities and we should look into those alternatives in fact the department of justice is probably already doing that and if they arent we can urge them to do so i will offer an amendment later which takes the 22 million plus an additional 8 million and adds it to the offices of the unitedstates attorneys an area where the money is desperately needed i will make the arguments for that later on today but i wanted members to be aware that there is already a 13 million shortfall in the unitedstates attorneys account for fiscal year 1988 and we are looking at anywhere from a 10 8 to a 21 7 million shortfall in fiscal year 1989 from the

million from my amendment would provide approximately 137 additional attorneys and 137 additional support staff positions unless we correct the fiscal year 1989 budget proposals the existing litigative bottleneck will only be exacerbated the already alarming declination levels in the unitedstates attorneys offices across the country will increase the unitedstates attorneys will not be
