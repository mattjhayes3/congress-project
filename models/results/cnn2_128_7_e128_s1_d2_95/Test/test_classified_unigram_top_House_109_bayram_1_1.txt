{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in opposition to h r 5 this legislation will not reduce medical liability premiums and it unfairly and arbitrarily discriminates against those most severely injured by medical errors i have consistently heard from physicians in central new jersey that the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance represents a growing crisis the rising premiums have compelled many physicians to leave the state or leave medicine altogether my wife is a general practice physician so i fully appreciate the gravity of the situation facing many doctors the rising cost of insurance poses obvious dangers for access to care particularly for populations most in need unfortunately the republican leadership has brought to the floor a bill that does not reduce premiums for physicians and imposes an arbitrary cap on damages for the most severely injured victims of malpractice or negligence capping noneconomic damages at 250 000 for patients who have won a medical malpractice tort will not result in lower insurance premiums for physicians just listen to what the insurance industry itself has said we have not promised price reductions with tort reform said dennis kelly an american insurance association spokesman in the chicago tribune in fact over the past few years payouts for medical malpractice cases have remained flat while premiums have continued to rise in some cases doubling because of insurance companies overcharging doctors for insurance the fifteen largest insurers have accumulated a surplus that is double what they actually need to pay claims we should be debating how to most effectively rebate this surplus to the doctors rather than looking for ways to reward them for the squeeze that they are executing on our healthcare system the insurance industry is gouging medical doctors and is trying to use patients as a scapegoat imposing a cap on damages inherently affects the patients most severely injured by malpractice or negligence setting the cap at 250 000 is an insult to all those who have had their lives permanently changed by med ical errors the figure is lifted directly from the 1975 california micra law adjusted for inflation this amount would be close to 1 million in 2005 dollars 250 000 does not come close to compensating for loss of life or permanent disability or disfigurement i am disappointed that for the third time in three years the rules committee has eliminated any opportunity to amend the legislation i am particularly disappointed that the rules committee disallowed substitute legislation by ranking members john conyers and john dingell their bill would weed out frivolous lawsuits require insurance companies to pass savings on to health care providers and provide targeted assistance to the physicians and communities who need it the most that congress is not permitted even to consider this legislation as an alternative demonstrates that the bill we have before us cannot survive on its own merits as liability insurance premiums continue to rise for physicians across the country the republican leadership continues to prescribe the same tired and ineffective legislation for good reason this bill has not survived the legislative process for the past three years yet we are once again debating whether to enrich insurance companies at the expense of victims of medical malpractice and negligence we need a comprehensive fair and effective approach to lowering insurance premiums for physicians the legislation we have before us is none of the above i encourage my colleagues to

that there can be no stability in iraq while our troops are still there it is our very presence appearing as occupiers and the resentment it is breeding that is responsible for the chaos and emboldened insurgency the roslehtinen amendment only serves to advance the bush administrations current failed policies by keeping the united states military in iraq indefinitely this amendment would continue the unsuccessful military occupation it would lay the groundwork for a constant and unending war only by ending the occupation can we hope to quell the violence and give iraq back to the

political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the

people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family

mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension

their same old tricks arrogantly preventing debate and consideration of critical measures that improve the bill and the lives of the people serving this nation they even prevented the distinguished ranking member of the armed services committee mr skelton from offering an amendment to his own defense bill the skelton amendment would have prevented the copays for medication for our military and their families from going up which they will if this bill is passed without the skelton amendment but the republican leadership refused to make it in order for those americans who are not familiar with the rules committee and i expect that is most of them and how it works what that effectively means is that a select few in the republican leadership have decided what the entire congress and the entire nation and what the men and women in uniform will get they decided that on their own without even a vote on the house floor without the debate and consideration of this full body given the rhetoric we hear on this floor every day about the troops and how important they are i feel compelled to ask my friends in the majority to justify how in less than 24 hours after they approved 70 billion in tax cuts for the wealths how they could refuse to allow us to even consider a measure to improve th6 health bare of our troops and their families we owe our troops more respect than this it is for similar reasons that many of my democratic colleagues and i are concerned with section 590 of this bill the section removes a longstanding requirement in our military code that requires chaplains to exhibit a level of tolerance compassion and understanding towards the religious diversity of the soldiers to whom they administer counsel can you imagine that mr speaker we are taking away the idea that they should serve with tolerance compassion and understanding it was too inflammatory i should say that i am confident our chaplains have both the sense and the respect for their fellow soldiers to do this and to do it willingly but why would this majority lower that standard and expect anything less from our chaplains as they clearly do we have soldiers of every faith and no faith fighting for us under the american flag they all deserve our respect particularly in moments of great despair or need is this majority so arrogant as to suggest that they should micromanage how a chaplain administers faith qn a battlefield i can think of few things more offensive or absurd my friend mr israel offered an amendment to the bill that would have corrected the problem restoring the requirement that all chaplains demonstrate sensitivity respect and tolerance but mr israels amendment was tossed out the window along with common sense on this issue it has been forbidden by the leadership from even being considered on the floor today as was an amendment from representatives tierney and leach which buyer cardoza davis il delay evans would have established a trumhnlike commission which we have been trying for 2 years to do one designed to ferret out corruption and incompetence in our military contracting and for some reason the majority of this house does not want to look where all that money is missing in iraq despite the fact that the same measure has passed the house numerous times and despite the fact that it is the clear will of this body that this commission be created and despite the fact that the word incompetence has become the most apt description of this administration a select few in this leadership made these decisions for all of us that we would not even consider that amendment today an amendment which were it enacted would allow us to go looking for the 9 billion in taxpayer money that this administration has literally lost in the

raid on student aid dont believe the hype not one student in america will receive less financial aid under our bill not one the heart of our bill is pell grants the heart of all financial aid on the federal level now lets look at the history of pell grant funding over the 20 years and see if republicans are in fact making quote a raid on student aid the yellow here shows the time period of 10 years when democrats were in control of congress and the red shows when republicans were in control of congress you see a dramatic increase in the maximum pell grant award does this look like a raid on student aid to you you have got to be kidding me in fact what is really instructive is if you lo6k at the last 3 years when the democrats were in control they had a democrat house and a democrat presi dent bill clinton and they actually cut pell grant funding 3 years in a row it went from 2 400 down to 2 300 the second critical flaw with the miller substitute is this amendment does not retain the 6 000 maximum pell grant award that our legislation has in fact they stay with the same old 5 800 maximum award so this substitute legislation reverse theraid on student aid provides less for pell grants instead of 6 000 5 800 how could that possibly be that we have a democrat substitute that actually calls for less awards of pell grants well dont call it a comeback we have been here for years it happened before their last 3 years in power cut pell grants here w6 have another attempt to do the same thing it has a third flaw it says that we are going to have a 3 4 percent interest rate for 1 year that is going to cost 2 7 billion but it has no offsets whatsoever how do they pay for it they dont tell us well if it is just a gimmick to have a lower rate without any way to pay for it why make it 3 4 percent why not 2 percent why not 1 percent why not interestfree loans it is crazy the truth of the matter is in 2002 republicans and democrats and student groups all got together and decided in a bipartisan manner what would be a fair fixed interest rate they decided on 6 8 percent they voted in favor of this in 2002 the democrats who offer this motion in fact in december of this last year when we supposedly cut all this money it was going to be the interest rates were going to remain at 6 8 percent that is the existing law and in fact in july they would go to 6 8 percent how inuch is the interest rate in our bill 6 8 percent no increase whatsoever and so now they are opposing something that they all thought was a good idea so i would argue that we have a pretty darn good

myths that we have been listening to for the last hour i think that possibly my colleagues do not intentionally mean to misrepresent the facts i think though that they are just sadly misinformed many times and have a misunderstanding of some of the facts i would like to if i can clarify a few of these dispel a couple of myths we have heard that social security is fine until 2052 then we have turned around and heard that benefits are going to be cut immediately and that is of concern to me i think we all know that there is a date 2018 and 2018 is the date when the social security system will stop running a surplus now this is important to us because it is at that point in time when those ious that the government has been writing the social security system the social security fund those are going to come due in 2018 now 2042 is the date that the ious run out the question for us to answer is this what are we going to do how are we going to pay it from 2018 until 2042 my colleagues have come against the president for raising this issue i would like to commend the president for having this discussion with the american people for encouraging us to talk about how we go about addressing social security it is important for those of us the members of the house elected from 435 districts around this great nation to decide what is going to be the best way to address social security with my constituents we look at it as two tracks one the stabilization and solvency how are we going to address this the other we look at is the enhancements that is where we begin talking about the personal accounts one of my colleagues today has called it a privatization scheme and i find that very sad because the money that men and women each and every one of us pay into social security is money we have earned and that is something that we deserve to have that our children deserve to have as a nest egg to build from as they get ready to retire it is not a scheme it is called working and earning a living and setting aside and that is money that you have earned and you deserve to have to be able to pass on to your heirs personal accounts is your own personal lockbox to be certain that that money is going to be there at the time that you get ready to retire i have also heard them talk about we need to stop deficit spending well lo and behold i would just love it if they would join us as we as the majority try to work on deficit spending but do my colleagues know what happens every single time we talk about reducing a program every single time we talk about eliminating a program that has outlived its usefulness every single time we talk about government efficiencies what do they want to do they want to grow the program they do not want to cut a program ronald reagan said the closest thing to eternal life on earth is a federal government program and he was right because once you got it it is so incredibly difficult to get rid of it so i invite our colleagues from across the aisle to join us we passed a budget this year we have done some great things this year and i commend our republican leadership for some of the steps that we have made such

plan would include hefty tax hikes on american families and american job creators and that is the only truth that can come out of that you cannot be unwilling to cut spending and expect the deficit to go away our budget recognizes that we do not need more revenue we have never had more revenue but we still have to make tough choices in a world of tough choices we can raise the price of the buffet

veterans and other claimants seeking benefits from va to have the choice of hiring and paying an attorney to represent them before the agency once a notice of disagreement has been filed current law prohibits an attorney from receiving a fee for representing a claimant until the board of veterans appeals renders its first decision on the claim unfortunately the claims process has become very complex and can be very overwhelming to some claimants this provision would give veterans the option of hiring an attorney earlier in the process if they believe they need assistance with their claim unlike some who have opposed this policy change i believe veterans are competent to make their own decision as to whether they want to hire an attorney to assist them with their claim this section is similar to a bill i introduced earlier this year hr 5549 the veterans choice of representation act of 2006 section 401 of the house amendment would authorize the secretary to furnish a memorial headstone or marker for an eligible dependent child whose remains are unavailable or if feasible add a memorial inscription to an existing headstone or marker provided by va currently va may provide a memorial headstone or marker for a veteran spouse or surviving spouse when remains are unavailable however if a spouse and child die at the same time and in the same manner and their remains are unavailable a veteran cannot receive a memorial headstone honoring the child the provision would correct this inconsistency and is identical to a provision what was passed by the house in july 2006

at a private cemetery and who died on or after september 11 2001 under current law the secretarys authority expires on december 31 2006 this provision was also passed by the house in july of this year

tried to get the facts on the matter and it has not been easy to get those facts in the course of our investigation with the helpof the government accountability office we have learned of some pretty terrible things first we found that halliburton was importing oil into iraq at extremely high prices we were particularly concerned about the companys decision to import gasoline from kuwait at a price far above market levels eventually defense auditors agreed and found that there were 263 million in unsupported and questioned costs in these contracts yet last month the corps of engineers ignored their auditors and reimbursed halliburton for 254 millionall but 9 million of the questioned costs this follows a pattern with halliburton the defense auditors had previously questioned 200 million in costs for meal services provided by the company which again was overruled by the army which gave the company 145 million this amendment to deny new contracts to companies that have a history of billing the government for questionable costs is hardly novel in january 2004 the defense contract audit agency itself recommended that the corps not enter into new contracts with

border we learned firsthand of the challenges faced by our brave border patrol agents in combating the flood of criminal activity that occurs along our southern border on a daily basis the information we learned on this trip and the information learned from dozens of other field hearings just like this from this past august all have been incorporated in the legislation that we will hope to take up

closely mirrors sections 101 1002 and 1003 of the border bill already passed by the house and authorizes more than 700 miles of twolayered reinforced fencing along the southwest border with prioritized placement at critical highly populated areas it also requires an evaluation of infrastructure needs along the northern border of america the secure fence act also mandates that the department of homeland security achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a virtual fence utilizing leading edge technology and through established best practices to create optimm results at the most efficient cost this includes the deployment of cameras ground sensors unmanned aerial vehicles and integrated surveillance technology this legislation further requires the department of homeland security to provide all necessary authority to border personnel to disable fleeing vehicles similar to the authority already held by united states coast guard for

to have a stake in operations in unitedstates ports is a dangerous decision that defies common sense history has shown that friends of the united states come and go those who are our friends today may not be our friends tomorrow the uae although alleged friends today have not been our friends in the past and there is nothig that proves that they will continue that friendship in the future the uae

role in killing 3 000 people on september 11 we cannot ignore their perilous past last time i checked we were at war against the taliban i find it extremely hard to believe that we would want to give a country that supported our enemies access to our ports if this deal were to go through these same foreign entities would have access to unitedstates manifests showing what cargo is being shipped and where and when it is going according to a recent zogby poll taken in october 2005 it found that over 70 percent of those who live in the uae do not even like the united states if this arrangement goes through who is going to stop a potential terrorist from posing as someone else going to work for one of these ports and gaining access to information with the intent to harm americans we do not need to take this risk with national security currently only 5 percent of the more than 14 million containers entering through our nations ports are screened clearly our ports are already vulnerable in a day and age where we are allowing 95 percent of the cargo to come and go through our ports without inspection it is hard to believe that we are willing to give security to a foreign entity much less one that has anything but a strong record in preventing terrorism even the unitedstates coast guard which is in charge of port security seems uneasy about letting this take place many americans across our land are opposed to this foreign operation in our homeland the port of beaumont in texas one of the operations proposed to be run by this uae deal ships onethird of the military cargo going to

prohibit foreign stateowned companies from controlling operations at unitedstates ports and stop the uae deal by mandating a congressional review of existing foreign stateowned companies that are operating in american ports there is an innate and inherit problem not to mention a serious national security risk with letting stateowned foreign companies buy interests in american ports i am not opposed to foreign privately owned companies operating in our country i understand we live in a global economy foreign ownership of a hotel or car company is one thing but foreign government ownership

are painting here just last week the republicans passed a bill called the deficit reduction act this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents dependon including medicaid medicare student loans food stamps and child support programs the republicans lectured us 6n the need to make sacrifices to control the national debt by passing the spending cut bill the republicans actually asked the poor the downtrodden the disabled and the young to sacrifice on behalf of the rest of the country now we are faced with the tax reconcili ation act which will add billions if not trillions to the deficit over the next 10 years one source estimates that if all of president bushs expiring tax cuts are extended including the alternative minimum tax amt relief

nationand reinforcing the borders as i have advocated for over a year and a halfis a difficult proposition however the gentleman from wisconsin and those that are in sbjpport of this bill do not seem to understand the complexities of border and immigration policy the bill before us today would do little to solve the immigration problem and it is not what we need to reform immigration policy and to reinforce our borders any effort by congress to truly reform immigration and protect our borders must address the root causes of illegal immigration as president bush has stated people come to the country to do the jobs americans do not want to do we must understand that it is our labor market that draws them to the unitedstates and we must address how the unitedstates could absorb the ecohomic blow of losing this part of our labor market that keeps prices artificially low for consumers are businesses ready to pay high wages to agriculture workers are americans ready to absorb that cost and pay higher prices for their produce an honest policy discussion is needed to address the complete problem our broken immigration system and the needs of our labor market although my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this bill will secure our borders it does nothing of the sort nothing in this bill guarantees funding for detention facilities border patrol agents immigration judges or prosecutors the single most important thing we can do in congress is invest in homeland security however our experience has been this numerous members of congress put forth ideas about how to fix border security but funding these ideas has been impossible lets use 2005 as an example one year ago the 9 11 commission did what congresss current majority could not do it investigated the events

the nation about how the government could prevent similar attacks in the future on the issues of border patrol agents and detention beds the 9 11 commission said the very least the united states needed to do was add 2 000 agents annuallyfor 10 yearsand 8 000 detention beds annually congress agreed and passed the bill overwhelmingly how did the president and congress react when it came time to pay for it all the presidents budget proposed funding 200 border patrol aents this yearthats 1 800 short of the least we should doand 1 900 detention bedsthats 6 100 short of the least we should do congress acted a little better passing an emergency spending bill and a spending bill for homeland security that netted us a total of 1 500 border patrol agentsstill 500 short of 9 11 commission recommendationsand 4 250 detention bedsstill 3 750 short of 9 11 commission recommendations we are playing a shell game with our border security and by extension our national security on the one hand every single elected official is for more border security yet the leadership in congress does not have the political courage to pay for it this is what always hangs us up theres no money and no political will to change the equation the american people deserve an honest debate on how to protect our homeland all of us in congress understand the world changed after september 11 for that reason

tireless advocacy of families and children while this legislation today is very much about using the force of federal law to confront child predators we know that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography and my amendment which is drawn from the child pornography prevention act of 2005 is designed to give law enforcement the tools to stop child pornography at the source it will fix a glaring loophole in the current law by requiring pornographers to keep records of the names and ages of their subject proof of identification this requirement we believe will deter the use of underage children in pornography additionally pornographers will be required to allow law enforcement to inspect their records failurb to do so will be a criminal offense we also in this legislation extend federal jurisdiction to socalled home pornographers that use downloading on the internet and digital and polaroid photography to essentially create an athome cottage industry

him not just in terms of the patriot act but many other issues that are within the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee however this is not about this particular chairman it is about the responsibility of future members of the judiciary committee to exercise that responsibility and i have a concern about oversight because let us be honest it is not easy dealing with the executive branch we have all had that experience we reach conclusions but we really do not know i can remember when the chairman himself discussed issuing a subpoena to bring the former attorney general mr ashcroft before the committee to provide us information on the socalled heavy guidelines that is what was necessary just recently i read where the vice chair of the government reform committee looking into the expenditures of monies involving the development for the fund of iraq expressed frustration with the lack of cooperation coming from the pentagon i have served on an invitation basis under chairman dan burton investigating the misconduct of the fbi in the boston office and again it required the threat of a contempt petition to gain information from the department of justice if we need to go that far then to exercise our oversight constitutional responsibility it is not an easy job to do so that is why all of the discussions today about oversight are framed in that context"]]}
