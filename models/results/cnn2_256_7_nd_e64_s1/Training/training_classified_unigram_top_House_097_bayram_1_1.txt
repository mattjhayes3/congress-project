camps during world war 11 with the passage of this resolution raoul wallenberg would join winston churchill as only the second foreign national to be so honored as churchill richly deserved his citizenship so does wallenberg deserve his his name is not a household word but his deeds show him to be the rarest kind of hero one who day in and day out risked his life to save the lives of others he did not know and in whose country he had never lived he is an international hero and an inspiration to all humanity wallenberg did his work with the most uncertain of tools his status as a neutral diplomat and his personal courage he used those tools as well as they could be used almost beyond conception in a frantic wartime situation charged with prejudice and fear he managed to convince hostile authorities to respect swedish protective passports he distributed at times he even managed to intimidate those with power of life and death over him and over those he saved he prevented the

debate on the various budget substitutes for fiscal year 1983 i would like to offer some comments for my colleagues to seriously consider regarding these budget proposals specifically i stand in opposition to the latta substitute this budget substitute will have a profound adverse effect upon the nation in general and the poor and minorities of this nation in particular it is most disquieting and troubling to me that the present administration as well as my fellow colleagues in the congress are continuing to recommend cuts in programs which adversely affect the poor of this nation at a time when approximately 50 million people are reeling from the debilitating consequences of inflation and unemployment this budget proposal has every indication of consigning this group to a position of permanent underclass in our nation it has become clear to me that the current administration had declared an all out war on our nations poor and middle class the hopeful and compassionate sociocconomic programs that were generated in the 1930s and 1960 s have been scuttled by these budget proposals a determination has been made to support defense needs as a priority rather than human needs as reflected in the disparate conditions of the nations average citizen the litany of sorrows and national frustrations already engulf the urban centers and rural areas of our nation added to these frustrations budget proposals continue to include cuts which fall most heavily on aid to families with dependent children supplemental security income food stamps child nutrition programs energy aid to the poor and support programs for the elderly the misery index has swe d beyond all conceivable dimensions how many americans feel that they are better off now than they were just 2 years ago it was just 2 years ago when this question was asked by our current president then candidate reagan i suggest that we ask the same question to the over 10 million unemployed i suggest to you now that we ask the same question to the family farmers who are bankrupt i suggest that we ask the same question to the factory workers the steelworkers the autoworkers the government workers educators senior citizens consumers construction workers transportation workers i suggest that we ask the white collar the blue collar hne nocollar working poor that same question i suggest that we ask ourselves what the answer would be i put this question to my colleagues in this chamber is our country better off today than it was yesterday if you examine your conscience and your heart you and i both realize that the answer is no the strategy of the current adininistration is to combat inflation at the expense of jobs by deliberately creating unemployment there are currently 10 3 million americans out of work not since june of 1941 when the united states was still suffering from the effects of the great depression has the nation experienced an unemployment level as high as the level for april 1982 reported by the labor department i find the latta budget proposal to be totally unacceptable and incompatible with the american ideal of equality of opportunity for all i have some specific examples to share with this body regarding the impact of past budget cuts on federal employees of our nation as well as the impact on postal employees and services since january 1981 8 914 federal employees have been separated from their jobs with another 18 000 federal workers displaced by rif procedures thousands of federal employees have been unilaterally furloughed without pay for 1 day per pay period resulting in nothing less than a 10 percent reduction in salary for those federal employees nor have federal retirees escaped the budet knife the reconciliation bill passeu by congress last july reduced their semiannual costofliving adjustments to just 1 per year in light of the above federal workers are wondering whether the administrations goal is austerity or extinction the president wants to eliminate totally the public service subsidy which supports uneconomica postal activities such as doortodoor service 6day delivery rural mail service and so forth last year congress reduced this subsidy by 452 million to 100 million for fiscal yenr 1983 now the administration would erase this subsidy entirely for fiscal year 1983 further significant reductions of this subsidy will inevitably contribute to deterioration of the quality of postal services and will significantly contribute to further postal rate increases the idea of a selfsupporting postal service is illadvised and unrealistic the idea of a postal service whose revenue will equal its operating expenses is simply incompatible with a postal service which provides efficient service at uniform economical rates to all citizens of this nation the postal service cannot be treated as if it were a private business to maintain a quality of service which americans need and rightfully expect to stem the increase of postal rates the postal service needs an infusion of funds provided by the public service subsidy the other category of postal appropriations which the administration wishes to cut dramatically is the revenue foregone appropriationthe direct aubsidy of the rates paid by certain categories of mailers the administration last year succeeded in cutting this subsidy to the point that rates paid by mailers have risen by anywhere from 50 to 110 percent and now the subsidy would be cut even more for fiscal year 1983 if this happens the rates will go still higher it is ironic that the same administration that is urging private charities to pick up the slack caused by cuts in social programs is now depriving these organizations of the wherewithal to do the job the situation is bad and getting worse and i say to you that the proposed latta substitute whil compound the problems we face this fierce attack directed against the needy is continuing in full force in this chamber this group is reeling from a national administrktion that has terminated the witr on poverty and declared war against the poor i believe it to be fitting and appropriate at this time to refer to hubert h humphrey a warrior for justice who during the dedication of the hubert h humphrey building in 1977 said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of lifethe children those who are in the twilight of lifethe aged and those in the shadows of lifethe sick the needy and the handicapped the latta substitute before this body shows only insensitivity toward the plight of these groups the assault continues on the children the old the sick and the handicapped and this is evidence enough that we are failing the moral test of government in april 1886 frederick douglass stated where justice is denied where poverty is enforced where ignorance prevails arid where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress ii 3094 rob and degrade them neither persons nor property will be safe this was written almost 100 years ago however the message conveyed still speaks loud and clear in relation to the increased military buildup at the expense of badly needed moneys for socioeconomic programs the philosophy the mind set the mentality of the administration and a majority of the members of this body are ones of a determination to misdirect our resources toward a massive war machine the fauntroy substitute was not about race for the effects of the substitute transcended race in our society suffering pain and deprivation cannot be equated with race swollen bellies in all white rural nebraska are just as debilitating as they are in all black harlem illiteracy in all white eastern kentucky and mental retardation in all white joplin mo are just as crippling as they are in mostly hispanic san jose suffering is a human condition which transcends consideration of race and color the latta substitute specifically with regare to social programs as well as in the a eas of general government is callous nd appalling this budget will eliminute resources which provide food shelter clothing jobs and health care to many of the poor and minorities in our nation i urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the latta substitute e"], [0.0007776021957397461, 0.9992223978042603, 1, "thank you ito go back 173 billion we spent last year and we are talking about a 53 3 billion increase in the military budget this year we are talking about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really only two ramifications for going down this road either we bankrupt this nation by moving more and more of its resources into a smaller and smaller segment of economy and the bottom drops out

bill which is now before us i might add that the senate bill does not have the current figures that is the september figures they have the previous figures of the administration request i so we will go to conference in that posture now there are many who have raised some questions with respect to funds for education and cultural programs including my distinguished colleague and ranking minority

am not sure which yetare internal allocations by 0mb these are not cuts which are proposed in this bill as a matter of fact i am violently opposed to the internal allocations of the cuts as suggested by 0imb and the director of ica i think it would be a disaster to allow those cuts to remain many of us have signed letters to the president and to the director of ica and to 0mb asking them to reconsider these cuts because what they are about to do if they insist on those al locations internally is effectively to wipe out our cultural exchange programs around the world now most of us if not all of us are agreed upon the importance of those programs and they should be continued i want to point out also that even if the house were to increase the amount of authorization even to the extent suggested by my colleague the gentleman from illinois it would still not guarantee that the internal allocations would not still hold what has to be done rather than vote for the motion to commit with instructions is to make sure that the administration internally does not carry out the allocations of the cuts in the manner in which they propose there are a lot of other things they could do they could for example prorate the cuts across the board they could take it out of other moneys that are available to them they could take it out of the radio construction account where funds are not immediately needed there are a lot of things that could be done but let me assure my colleagues who are concerned about this and some of whom will speak on this issue that we as a committee are aware of this problem we are opposed to the allocations which unfairly target these programs for such large cuts we will do everything we can to keep those programs alive as of right now the appropriations

wallenberg while i must admit that prior to this congress i knew very little about raoul wallenberg it has become increasingly obvious to me that raoul wallenberg is indeed the lost hero of the jewish holocaust for in the darkest hours at the end of world war ii this young swedish diplomat came forth at great personal risk and sacrificed his freedom so that fellow human beings by the hundreds of thousands could be saved from nazi extermination raoul wallenberg is indeed a great humanitarian and it is my fervent hope that just as raoul wallenberg saved thousands of lives by conferring swedish passports and quasiswedish citizenship on people we can now use the same device to perhaps save him while cynics may now ask why expend this effort on an individual who the russians claim died more than 30 years ago i believe very strongly that this nation which commissioned raoul has an inherent responsibility to do whatever it can even at this late hour to determine what really happened to raoul wallenberg in good conscience can we really do any less for had raoul wallenberg decided to only safeguard his own freedom then hundreds of thousands of hungarian jews would not have survived

of h r 3519 contains a provision that will assist the enforcement process for selective service registrants currently and i think a fact which is not well documented is the fact that our young people of this country our young men of 18 years of age had responded as the gentleman from new york said in an excellent manner for the first period last year is the first year that we had registration some 95 percent of our 18 yearolds actually registered for the second period beginning in january of this year some 88 percent have registered it is important i believe to insure that all those eligible understand their obligations under the law to register and thus share equally the responsibilities of military service in the event of an emergency it would be inequitable to establish a system that would permit compliance by only some of the eligible population to do this we must have an effective enforcement process such an enfprcement process unfortunately does not exist today on november 24 of last year the unitedstates supreme court for the district of columbia ruled that the selective service system could not require that registrants provide their social security identification numbers as part of the registration process in its opinion the court stated and i quote citizens have a diuty to serve in the armed forces and a correlative right to register unimpeded by invasion of their privacy unless statutorily authorized without access to social security numbers the director of selective service has testified that the registration requirement will be largely unenforceable the court was also aware of the situation the courts opinion continues as follows the court is well aware of the impact of this decision there is an obvious need for verification of identity by social security number in this instance the failure of congress to provide the necessary authority quite possibly recults from a legislative error it is clear from the congressional hearings preceding reinstitution of registration that congress was aware that social security numbers would be requested in the registration form if in fact there was an inadvertent omission this can be immediately corrected by the congress before the next registration in january i am certain the congress intended to allow the selective service system to enforce this requirement by using social security numbers and the government has so argued by appealing this case however rather than permit this ambiguity to continue the committee has recommended a provision providing specific statutory authority for the selective service system to require that registrants provide their social security numbers the most complete list of potential registrants is in the social security files the selective service system can match the numbers of those who have registered against those of the relevant age group in the social security files to determine initially those who have not registered these individuals can then be advised of their obligation and if they still choose not to register be subject to criminal charges the provision recommended by the committee would also permit the president to require the social security administration to provide identifying information to the selective service system this information would be used only for the purpose of enforcement of the registration requirement section 904 has one additional provision that would authorize the director of selective service to provide the department of defense information drawn from registration forms for purposes of recruiting currently only information from the forms of registrants who indicate an interest in receiving recruiting information is provided to the defense department by the selective service system in practice only 15 percent of the individuals have so indicated to obtain records of eligible individuals the military recruiting organizations are forced to purchase lists that are commercially available at a time when the department of defense will spend aimost 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1982 to recruit personnel it seems appropriate to assist this effort by providing a list of eligible individuals i urge

nuclear arms buildup the zablocki resolution says very simply that the time to establish a mutually verifiable bilateral freeze on the nuclear arms race is now and that substantial reductions in the nuclear arsenals of both the united states and the soviet union should promptly follow bilateral adherence to a freeze in the brief time allotted i want to focus my remarks on the most critical issue in this debate advocates of the broomfield substitute claim that if we freeze superpower nuclear stockpiles at their present levels we will leave ourselves vulnerable to a preemptive first strike nothing could be further from the truth to put the issue of our own nuclear deterrent in perspective it should be noted that of the 50 000 tactical and strategic nuclear warheads owned by the united states and the soviet union 30 000 are the property of the united states if the unimaginable were to happen tomorrow and the soviet union were to launch a surprise first strike against the united statesa strike so extraordinarily accurate that it defied even the worst case scenarios of all our military analysts by totally eliminating our landbased nuclear force our airborne nuclear fleet and all the nuclear submarines that are in port at any one timethere would remain at sea at least 20 nuclear submarines each carrying 16 missiles each missile carrying 8 to 10 nuclear warheads each warhead having an explosive power on the average seven times that of the bomb that fell on hiroshima these 20 subs alone would be sufficient to destroy every major industrial defense and population center in the soviet union three times over there is more explosive power in just one of our nuclear submarines than in all of the munitions combined that exploded in world war ii nonetheless we stand here today in the presence of people who passionately argue that our present nuclear arsenal is insufficient to deter a soviet first strike there is only one word to describe this posture madness the devastation of hiroshima is a frightening and repulsive image that will burn in human memory forever it is a memory that graphically and indisputably conveys the horror of nuclear holocaust today the explosive force of the bomb that fell on hiroshima is dwarfed by the megatonnage of the superpowers nuclear arsenals now estimated to be 1 6 million times that of the hiroshima device if we fail to pass the zablocki resolution todayif we fail to seize upon this opportunitythen that destructive force will continue to grow exponentially like a cancer out of control the real question before us is whether or not we are in greater danger by freezing the nuclear arms race now or whether we run a greater risk by allowing the nuclear arms race to continue at its maddening pace my own view is that an immediate bilateral and verifiable nuclear freeze is in our nations best interest one last point we are planning to spend 1 6 trillion on defense over the next 5 yearsa sum the magnitude of which is difficult to imagine if we were to spend that sum at the rate of 1 million per day 365 days a year it would take us over 4 000 years to exhaust the warchest now the president tells us that he does not feel constrained by even this extraordinary spending target he is concerned that the incredible sums already allotted are insufficient to cover what in fact will be the real costs of his defense program the department of defense now concedes that the cost of the reagan defense program was underestimated by 780 billiona sum that is nearly five times greater than the anticipated federal deficit for this fiscal year the defense budget is out of control and unless we alter our plans to participate in a nuclear arms race of indeterminable length and magnitude we will commit ourselves to a future of greater deficits continued highinterest rates crippling levels of unemployment and an everescalating diversion of scarce capital and human resources away from those areas of genuine need

committed last year neither contains any basic difference in its economic content and neither will alter the disastrous course on which the nation is traveling what we have here are two political agendas one by the gentleman from ohio has enough phony numbers and false assumptions to create the fiction that adoption of his resolution would bring the projected deficit down below the magic 100 billion level suddenly a deficit below 100 billion has become the fiscally sound position of my friend from ohio who for many a year has proclaimed that any deficit at all is irresponsible it does not matter what devices are used my friend from ohio wants to be able to claim that he will bring the deficit below the politically magic mark but he knows that the actual result wilt not be so for he knows that the magic mark has been reached only by the use of tricks and mirrors it is bad enougi that the latta program employs fiction to create the desired political illusion what isworse is that in order to eliminate or reducecuts that were thoughttoibe unpalatable he doubles the cuts to the poor the unemployed and the downright desperate it is a crude coarse and morally indefensible thing to lay all the budget cuts on the backs of the economically weak and the politically impotent that is what was done last year and that is what the present latta budget aims to do this year only in a redoubled fashion what is worse he brings this forward at a time when there are millions of newly unemployed at a time when there are hundreds of thousands whose benefits are about to run out he well knows that even now only i out of 5 unemployed workers today is able to draw unemployment benefitsyet his plan will throw hundreds of thousands more of the unemployed onto the welfare rolls at the same time he would reduce by many billions of dollars the help that is available for family assistance for food housing and for medical care even as there are hundreds of thousands of newly poor people created by the program he championed last year he would make more hundreds of thousands suffer new deprivations he wants to make more and more people struggle for less and less in the name of cynical expediency to foster a budget illusion last year it was clear that the republican program is an economic policy that is a rich mans war and a poor mans fight the latta resolution this year makes that even more plain it would make the poor even more poor and it would create more poor to join them in fighting for survival in an evershrinking pond of opportunity fewer jobs less help less hope less everything the proposal put forward by my friend from oklahoma at least has the virtue of not making a bad situation very much worse it does no favors for the poor but at least it avoids the egregious and morally indefensible action of redoubling the burdens that have been thrust upon them it at least recognizes that the truly needy can use some true help it at least does not pretend that there is any way within the reagan framework that the deficit can be held below the magic 100 billion level not even the republican senate nor ronald reagan believes that it simply cannot be done unless mr reagan is willing to make changes that he thus far has refused to make the jones proposal is the better of two bad choices but the shame of it is that nothing the house will do today will make any difference in the economic mess of the country we are in a case of economic policy gridlock nothing we do today will start the traffic moving all that the two proposals hope to do is to stop everybody from honking their horns for a while trusting that something in the next few months will persuade mr reagan to reconsider his stubborn refusal to accept any change in his policy and thereby unlock the policy jam the reagan policy let us remember was supposed to produce a 1982 deficit less than half as big as we will actually experience it is a policy that was supposed to produce a 1083 deficit of less than onefourth of what my republican friends are today fervently embracing it is a policy that was supposed to produce a balanced budget even a surplusbut which now not even mr reagan says can ever happen the reason is simple even under a full employment economy the reagan tax program will riot yield anything close to the revenues needed to support the reagan expenditure proposals mr reagan knows this his budget office admits it and yet he will not june 10 1982 h 3354 accept the responsibility to come forward with any meaningful changes in his tax program this reagan policy let us remember was supposed to create a great boom in economic activity the fact is that the economy is in its weakest state since the great depression it is shrinking going backward and growing more fragile by the hour in its economic effect the reagan program has been precisely the opposite of what was predicted for it this is a uolicy let us remember that was stipposed to reduce unemployment instead we have better than 2 million newly unemployed persons we have a depression in the housing industry a depression in the auto industry our steel industry is working at far below half its capacity onethird of our industrial plants sit idle there is no prospect for a healthy economic recovery brave predictions by one or another of the presidential wise men tell us from time to time that a return to health is just around the laffer curve but the curve turns out to be endless this reagan policy let us remember was supposed to create a dramatic drop in interest rates but that did not happen interest rates for housing are as high or even higher than they were a year ago corporations and not even the federal government are able today to finance long term borrowings the interest rates are choking off the economy killing business killing prospects what is mere not even the secretary of the treasury foresees the kind of drop in interest levels that would be necessary to produce any meaningful economic recovery and the reason for this is simple it is not possible for interest rates to go down if the federal government maintains a fiscal policy that is in direct conflict with a tight monetary policy so interest ratesare destined to remain high no matter what we do here today because the choices laid before us do not change that fundamental and deadly contradiction that brings us to the nub of the issue at a time when we need a statement of economic policy we get political agendasneither of which addresses the economic issue at all one of the agendas the one offered by my friend from oklahoma is a little less unsatisfactory than the other but by no means a prescription for economic recovery nor a guide for the necessary changes that must be made neither proposal before us has aroused huzzahs from wall street nor hosannas from the people both the financial wizards and the citizens on the sidewalk know that neither of these proposals changes the policy mix that constitutes the oozing swamp through which we are walking the truth is that the budget act never was envisioned as a vehicle for development of economic policy it was envisioned as a method through which the congress could set its fiscal priorities it assumed that the world would be a more or less predictable place that the economy would be more or less stable that we would be faced with choices around certain narrow margins last year the act got twisted into a juggernaut of economic policyoverridding all economic judgment overriding all careful legislative process overriding all counsels of caution and moderation the result was tragic and the tragedy continues today because we are persisting in seeing the budget process as a determinant of economic policy the policy has already been determined the budget process as we see it today only reaffirms the bad policy that got embedded into law last year it has become an embarrassment to those who brutally misused it last yearfor having twisted it into something it never was they cannot now return it to the original purposes for which it was intended neither are they able to use it to reverse or even modify the policies that were created through it less than 1 year ago the leacership is now rethinking the budget process and that is all to the good meanwhile ve have a legislative process that is choked and tangled by the wreckage of the budget process this year legislative committees cannot legislate policy because we do not know what the budget will eventually allow appropriations committees cannot mark up their bills because they do not know what the budget will eventally command rhe irony of it all is that for all this stumbling in the dark we know that no economic change will be wrought here today or in the conference that will follow any decisions re reach it might be different if we were in fact faced with a real choice between budgets it might be different if we were given a budget proposal that faced up to the economic realities of todaythat faced up to the need for redressing some of the unfairness in last years tax giveaway that faced up to the need to stand on some kind of principle of fairness for the poor the elderly the sick the disabled the unemployed or that faced up squarely to the growing desperation of unemployment created by a shrinking economy but we have no such proposal before us we are given tokens much like political wooden nickles that will make no economic difference and perhaps little political difference either if we are going to permit the budget process to be the vehicle for deciding all economic policy let us at least have some clear choices between the affirmative and the foolhardy between the just and the unjust last year we had the choice between the foolish and the indifferent the majority chose the foolish this year we have the choice between the hopelessly immoral and the pale nod toward justice neither time have we been given any reason to think that our choice would change the economic result for in each case the choices accepted the premise of the reagan program if we are going to pretend that the budget means a choice between economic policies let us have choices that at least rest on differing premises but i we are not let us have done with this whole weary process raid return to a world in which congress can at least function a world in which its committees can at least act and in which it can make decisions let us not continue pretending that the budget process is something that it never was the budget as it is being used here and as it was used last year is a blind auction we do not know with any precision what the consequences will be if we adopt either one of the proposals we have herewe only have a hazy idea and we are not given time nor the information to gain any meaningful information the budget resolution is a bidding war just as i predicted it would become when the house passed the budget act 8 years ago it is axiomatic that in such bidding wars it is the people who lose the victims of last years bidding war are better than 2 million freshly unemployed people they are the thousands of businesses that have been forced to close down because of high interest rates they are the sick the hungry the old the young searching for jobs the middle class people hoping to buy homes the students

it occurs to me that the arguments that have been used by those who want increases in these activities these particular accounts within the epa are all predicated and based upon 1982 funding our position on this bill on the environmental protection agency and the other agencies of government is that we have to look at the total spectrum and we have to determine whether or not there are other areas that have suffered as a result of reductions in the 1983 budget estimates and of course other areas have suffered as much or more i think all agencies have to share the burden not epa alone but all agencies our concern as has been so well brought out by the gentleman from new york the ranking member of this subcommittee and his colleague the gentleman from new york"], [0.0033145546913146973,

has an allocation to the overall spending of some 487 billion it is silly to believe the budget committee can control each department and agency through a target resolution they adopted in june without the benefit of hearings but the overall ceiling we are well within it for the appropriations under our committees overall 302 allocations we do reserve in the committee the right to sub l ocate it as we see fit and we did suballocate it when the president sent down the requests for the additional money that was still within the overall ceiling but the ceiling is on the commitige as a whole and not department by department so we had enough latitude to include these requests by the president it may be over for the original allocation to this department but we did not know that the president was going to request this but we are still within and under the ceiling imposed overall"], [0.004212081432342529, 0.5042120814323425, 1, "we are all aware that there is a crisis in washington because of the unwillingness of the financial community to bring down interest rates because of continuing budget deficits there are a number of suggestions now being made with respect to howv to deal with this serious economic problem one group says we should cut more deeply into defense another group says we should cut social security and a third group says we should go back and cut some of the social programs some people have even suggested putting the bankers in jail all of these approaches would obviously be disastrous yet the director of the office of management and budget tells us that we need some 70 billion of additional revenue in order to get the reagan program into balance well yesterday i introduced into the house h r 4487 this is a relatively painless solution to our problems it provides for a reduction in the personal income tax rates in the reagan tax cut legislation now on the books from 25 to 15 percent this change will produce an estimated 65 billion of revenue by passing this bill we will not have to cut defense or social security or undertake further cuts in our domestic programs my bill does not tamper with any other feature of the tax cut legislation including the stimulative cuts provided to business i urge members to join me in cosponsoring this legislation so that we can have a viable alternative to damaging budget cuts"],

that the gentleman and the subcommittee chairman have pointed out and underlined the importance of keeping some funding here because there is no such thing as maintaining the pipeline in indian housing unless we actually do it that is the idea that you can refuse these funds as was first recommended by the administration and that is why i am glad we are clarifying the situation even though the amendment reduces the budget request by the administration we are still stressing the fact that we are still maintaining some funding in the indian housing pipeline i would prefer keeping the program at its present level rather than cutting it this amendment will preserve the program but cut it in half i am also pleased that this tandem arrangement with the department of the interior was clarified because that has been the problem the poor indian has been not only very much neglected but we have backed off on our commitments and it has only been of 3 years duration that we have really gone into an indian housing program from the standpoint of the housing authorization legislation so i am delighted that we have stressed that i just want to make sure that i understand it correctly the funding that the gentleman is more or less indicating he wants earmarked for the purposes of indian housing will be over and above that which is necessary to maintain the pipeline as it is now"],

sincerest thanks for the way he has exerted leadership of our committee for these 4 years as chairman of the subcommittee which deals with this subject matter i had the opportunity to sit in on the chair mans meetings they were thorough and meticulous and i believe they would rank with any subcommittee and full committee hearings in this house for their thoroughness and for their objectivity and for their completeness i would like to indicate to the gentleman from massachusetts that he has done an excellent job the gentleman from kentucky in years past has urged the house with no great success to at least divulge a total figure for the national intelligence budget the gentleman from kentucky of course does not seek to do that today i do believe at some point that the matter should come before our panel and should come before this house we did hear as everyone remembers some interesting testimony from people who were very active in the intelligence field they felt that divulging a total figure would not provide particularly significant information to our enemies of whom there are many in the world but it would certainly be helpful to the members who are trying to gage the effectiveness of the intelligence activities of our own nation perhaps as i say this mnatter can come before the house for debate at some time in the future but i would like to sum up by thanking the chairman for the work that he has done and the work that his subcommitten has done and to thank him for allowing us to sit with him during the deliberations i think the house and the nation will

has worked its will this afternoon it is not my will i have difficulty with the bill as it nowv stands when one brings this kind of a bill to the floor when we have had some consensus on the bill with respect to committees of the house and also with respect to menmbers in this house i think there is an obligation on my part to support that position i have done that and the committee has done it i think and our side has done it to the best of our ability again this bill gives me great trouble in its present form i can understand the position of those who supported the amendment that was offered by the distinguished and able and persuasive gentleman from ohio we spent many long hours on the committee and in hearings on this bill together over the past few years i can appreciate his position i also appreciate the fact that the administration had a preference for the senate bill 391 which includes the language that was offered by the gentleman from ohio my own position is that i cannot support this bill on final passage i do not intend to do it we will leave it that in the final analysis it is going to pass anyhow we will get to conference and as a conferee i am not going to try to disrupt the rather significant opinion of the membership of this committee or this house but we will leave to the conferees their best judgment what will be done in conference i suppose that one can

constituents an elderly woman of 71 was beaten and robbed also victimized by crime she was hospitalized in 7 days her bills amounted to about 7 000 she lives on 280 a month where would she be if she had not had medicare insurance coverage which is indeed minimal i ask the members of congress who have comprehensive health coverage what would your plight be if you did not have medical coverage so now we have the budget proposal under the guise of reduction of doctors fees and hospital costs which substantially decrease medicare coverage what will be the result older people will receive less

gentleman from georgia binding the congress limiting the will of the majority we just had a gentleman talk about reading the constitution today the first point i would like to make is that the constitution was written for one and only one purpose in terms of amendments and the bill of rights and that was to limit the will of the majority what the bill of rights says is that we do not let 51 percent of the congress or the people limit freedom of speech or religion we do not let the majority oppress certain rights that are guaranteed in the constitution what we are saying is we want to protect the rights of the people to an economy in which they can make their plans in which they can balance their budgets in which they can have their families grow up and prosper that is what the amendment is about we have heard references all day to prohibition and how unwise that was but i make the point that prohibition was an attempt to deviate from the constitutional pattern by limiting the freedom of people the constitution was written to limit the freedom of government and this amendment fits perfectly within that pattern because it limits the freedom of government to engage in the process of destroying this economy year after year by spending more than we take in and by imposing the cruelest tax of all an inflation tax which falls most heavily on the shoulders of the old the poor and the sick the alexander amendment was written by people who oppose a balanced budget people rho have fought this effort from the beginning because they know that a requirement to balance the budget which is in fact binding w~ll mean that we will have to set priorities that we will have to tell political constituencies no and it will destroy the bulk vote in america and that is where the source of opposition comes from it comes from those who know that in a binding constraint the programs that cannot stand the test of efficiency and competition will be denied the alexander amendment is absolutely meaningless it will allow us to declare a national emergency and waive this amendment just as we do on virtually every appropriation when we waive the requirements of the budget this amendment is a sham and a fraud with two objectives first to try to derail a legitimate effort which has been ongoing for 4 years to bring an amendment which has bien well thought out an well debated and which will deal with the problem to give the american people the vote they want second it has been written to allow those who claim to be conservative back home who claim they are for a balanced budget back home to cast a vote here today so they can go back home and try to confuse the people again in an election year there is no doubt about the fact that the objective of offering this amendment has a second purpose that purpose is to try to adopt this amendment so that those who have cosponsored the only amendment being voted on today that has any meaning whatsoever can get off the hook and say that they were for a legitimate balanced budget amendment but now this one was adopted and they decided that it would do the job better i ask my conservative friends on the democratic side of the aisle not to contribute to thh fraud not to cast a vote that will simply allow a legitimate effort to be derailed as a final point i would like to say this for 4 years the vast majority of the members of this body have worked hard to get a vote on a balanced budget amendment let us not make that a sham here today by bringing to the floor this amendment and dignifying it by having it adopted by a majority vote i urge my colleagues not to take an action which will derail an effort which the american people support that i think is the issue that is why we need to say no on the alexander substitute and why we need to say yes on the conablejenkins amendment"]]}
