of the worlds sugar is sold in protected markets even small surpluses and shortages make world market prices roller coaster up and down this year a 3 million ton overproduction in the european economic community was dumped onthe world market and dropped prices by 50 percent unitedstates policyfor 40 years from 1934 to 1974 the unitedstates protected its sugar under a sugar act and kept domestic prices stable at levels that gave unitedstates beet and cane growers steady but not excessive profits since then unitedstates policy has been erratic and consumers have faced excessively high prices in some years while the growers in others have faced excessively low ones hawaiis largest sugar grower amfac now is absorbing sugar losses of 5 million a month and its directors have threatened to close down oahu sugar co and possibly more of their five plantations a unitedstates support price of 17 cents a pound is now before congress in the farm bill but may be killed in the house of representatives if the bill dies the united states will revert to a 1949 farm act as a basic policy it contains no support for sugar even the 17 cent price in the farm bill being considered by congress is well below the local industrys production costs of around 20 cents a pound another aspect of the support price situation is the development of a substitute sweetener made from corn higher support prices will work to give the corn substitute a higher market share since it can sell for less a minisugar act for hawaii would have the advantage of not helping corn competition because it wouldnt raise national sugar prices but it could be expensive in any formsubsidy loan tax concession or whatever our production is 1 million tons a year or about 2 billion pounds of refined cane sugar even a 1centapound support plan would cost 20 million when needed and a single penny is not about to do the job itf years like this we may be in for some serious thinking in the months ahead of how much saving the sugar industry is worth to au uts for myself its quite a lot mfom the honolulu advertiser dec 12 1981 american sugar needs support to compreter by dr thomas k hitch the united states has not had an affirmative sugar policy since 1974 when the 1934 sugar act expired our sugar policy from 1934 to 1974 40 years was to have sugar prices stabilized in the american market by assigning marketing quotas based on unitedstates requir ements to domestic and foreign producers so that prices found a level that would be fair to both the american consumer and the american sugar producer since 1974with no sugar policythe price of raw sugar in the american market has been on a roller coasteras high as 65 cents in 1974 as low as 9 cents in 1976 as high as 44 cents in 1980 and now at about 16 cents the unitedstates beet and cane sugar producers cannot remain in business on a permanent basis with this kind of wild1ly fluctuating price levelwith two of the last eight years being boom years 74 and 80 one being barely profitable 1975 and the other five being deeply depressed years with tremendous losses even during these years the american consumer has not benefited because while there have been more years of cheap sugar than of dear sugar the price of sugar rose to such astronormical heights that it probably hurt the consumer more in those years than he has helped in the cheap years also when very high sugar prices push the price of randies ice cream soft drinks and baked goods up they tend to stay up after the price of sugar falls so that the american consumer to a certain extent lives with high sweetening prices even when sugar becomes cheap again to understand the world sugar market one has to realize that some 80 percent of the sugar produced in the world has a guaranteed home at a guaranteed price that prices in these countries do not fluctuate up and down with world under and overpro duction and that the socalled world price for sugar is set by demand and supply forces that affect only that 18 percent of the worlds sugar production that is uncommittedand therefore very cheap when world production is surplus and very dear when world production is short to put it another way all the major sugar exporting countries of the world have a government guaranteed set price for sugar boasumed in that country with the price set at a level that will make it profitable to grow sugar in such large quantities that it is a major export item this is truefor cuba brazil australik philippines south africa argentina india mexico and the eec as well as the rest of the smaller sugar exporting countries take the eec through its common agricultural policy cap european growers are not only guaranteed 27 cents a pound but are encouraged to produce excess sugar for export and in the last decade the eec has become a major exporter of subsidized sugar in contrast to having traditionally been a net importer of sugar european sugar is now being sold in large quantities in the unitedstates market when the price for raws is about 15 cents after paying shipping and insurance while the price in europe is 27 cents this situation is demonstrited by the fact that when the world sugar market price skyrocketed from about 10 cents a pound in 1973 to 65 cents a pound in 1974 there was no change in the domestic price of refined sugar in the countries that produced 60 percent of the worlds export sugar and only a modest change upward in the other export ing countrieswhile the price in the unitedstates more than doubled the same thing happened when world sugar prices fell furthermore most of the worlds sugar importing countries are buffered against fluctuations in this small but highly volatile world marketbuffered generally by longterm agreements with sugar exporting countries to provide them with a normal supply at a normal price this is shown by the fact that in that same period of rapid price rise 19731974 the countries that consumed 22 percent of all world sugar imports bad no change in the domestic price of sugar those accounting for 12 percent of world imports only a 1 to 15 percent rise and with only a handful of countries with the unitedstates being far and away the major one suffering from the full inflation of prices the socalled world sugar market being only a small fraction of world sugar production is a market where in periods of world sugar shortage the buyer pays exorbitant prices and where in periods of world surplus all homeless sugar is dumped if the unitedstates does not adopt a constructive sugar policy it will ultimately lose its domestic sugar industrywhich will be a considerable economic loss since among agricultural products sugar ranks tenth in terms of acreage fifth in terms of tonnage and sixth or seventh in terms of dollars to the farmer the unitedstates sugar industry will not be killed by cheap foreign sugar that is produced more efficiently than ours it will be killed by foreign sugar that is dumped into our market at either a loss to the producer or at a profit that is provided by subsidies from the government of origin unitedstates sugar production is probably among the most efficient in the worldjust like our production of wheat corn rice soya beans and many other agricultural products but it cannot live on a 12 cents or 15 cepits or even 17 cents per pound pricea price which incidentally is about the same as good top soil at your corner garden shop in short if the unitedstates were to require that foreign sugar not be allowed to be sold in the american market at a lesser price than it is sold for in the country of origin the unitedstates sugar industry would be profitable and have a long and successful life furthermore if we lost our domestic sugar industry the nation and its consumers would have to live with the roller coaster of the world sugar market and could even find itself facing an opeclike foreign sugar cartel since the top 13 sugar exporting nations ship about 80 percent of the sugar entering world tradenumbers much like those in the oil cartel finally if the unitedstates lost its domestic sugar industry it would face catastrophe in the event of war or major shipping interruptions let us remember that in such times sugar has always been about the first commodity to be rationed that napoleon developed the beet sugar industry when the british blockade stopped the flow of essential foreign sugar to europe and that all the countries of the world that protect their domestic sugar industries do so primarily

whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and international perspective of recognizing raoul wallenberg in this unique way for the unprecedented things he did at our request"],

with support the 5cent increase in the price they pay for their diesel fuel in fact many have stated that they would support moderate increases in the miscellaneous taxes on truckers but a 163percent

the inspector general act amendments of 1981 today now that we have seen the concept at work in 16 of the 20 largest agencies and departmentsand now that we have carefully and correctly evaluated the need for it in these last four entitiesi am in total agreement that it is time to expand the existing law to cover the departments of defense treasury and justice and the agency for international development when i look at the three departments and the agency in question today i see four federal entities each with unique responsibilities and special functions despite their unique status however they are like every other department and agency in the sense that they are vulnerable to fraud waste and mismanagement they need what was created in the 1978 act inspectors general who are responsible for conducting and supervising audits and investigations of agency activities providing leadership in promoting efficiency and effectiveness within the agency detecting and preventing fraud abuse and waste and informing the agency head and congress of problems and needed corrective actions the io concept is a sound workable concept that brings together the audit and investigative resources of an agency under a single official who reports directly to the head of the agency and to the congress that focal point and that kind of independence are lacking today at the departments of defense justice and treasury and at the agency for international development the need for that kind of focal point is unmistakable at the department of defense where some 18 000 auditors investigators and inspectors struggle to pinpoint and eliminate waste and inefficiency their task is made more difficult by the fact thatdespite the gargantuan size of the departmentno single individual has clear unquestioned responsibility or authority for coordinating the work of the 18 000 waste hunters i understand that an administrative decision has been made to create within the department an assistant to the secretary for review and oversight and that this new official will have some of the duties and responsibilities of a statutory inspector general this new official however will be solely under the control and direction of the secretary will not report to the congress and will always be in danger of having his office dismantled administratively just as easily as it was created administratively for those reasons a statutory inspector general with the powers and duties outlined by h r 2098 would in my view be much more preferable and much more effective the departments of justice and treasury also need statutory inspectors general i recognize that each has unique law enforcement roles and that each has taken significant steps to combat fraud waste and mismanagement still i firmly believe that a properly conceived inspector general in each department could function smoothly and effectively without compromising or negating the work of the fine professionals who currently staff the office of professional responsibility at the department of justice or the office of the inspector general at the department of the treasury finally h r 2098 will bring under the statutory ig umbrella the current statutory inspector general at the agency for international development this position was created late last year by the foreign assistance act but it was not created fully in line with the omnibus inspector general act of 1978 h r 2098 will remedy that oversight and will give us an inspector general at aid who reports to the congress as well as to the director of the agency if we are truly to wage a war against fraud and abuse it is essential that each agency and department operate with maximum efficiency and economy it is my firm belief that h r 2098 will

reducing federal spending as the most effective weapon in the ongoing war against inflation has at last received its proper priority in both the white house and on capitol hill the budget resolution recently passed by the congress and with substantial impetus provided by the reagan administration acting on its mandate from the american people correctly targeted inflation as the greatest threat to this nati ns economic health and viability that message was not lost on the public works and transportation committee when the conference report to the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 directed our committee to achieve certain savings in both its authorization and direct spending programs we more than met the level of savings recommended in the reconciliation instructions in fact the committee in a strong bipartisan approach responded to the dollar targets set in the conference report by submitting recommendations containing 28 million of added savings in budgetary authority and over 400 million in outlays in accordance with budget committee guidelines the committee recommended no specific legislative changes for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 since reductions assumed by the budget resolution of the out years were for programs not presently authorized beyond fiscal year 1982 however the committee clearly and strongly expressed its commitment to achieve the recommended out year reductions when its programs come up for reauthorization in exceeding the aggregate savings directed by the budget resolution our committee complied with both the letter and the spirit of the savings directives it received while at the same time recognizing the expertise of the committee to make the necessary decisions on any programmatic changes i might say at this point that savings achieved by the public works and transportation committee in its recommendations to the budget committee were not reached without substantial discussion and some hard decisions on highly significant programs of great impact throughout the nation in making the necessary decisions on these programs our committee sought and achieved a careful balance between the essential spending reductions and the needs of vital programs in that regard the committee stressed the need to provide funding sufficient to those public works investment programs so essential to president reagans goal of national economic revitalization savings in specific programs were achieved in the following areas under public works and transportation committee jurisdiction in aviation the committee achieved a 139 million savings with 650 million cap in fiscal year 1982 budget authority for the airport development and noise abatement programs a figure substantially below the 789 million set by the congressional budget office even as we make the necessary decisions to reduce funding for aviation programs we must continue to protect our valuable capital investment in airports and air traffic control systems if we expect to meet projected increases in air traffic growth likewise the nations capital investment in its highway and public transit systems so essential to any plans for industrial revitalization must continue to receive high priorities in its recommendations to the budget committee our committee put an 8 2 million limitation for fiscal year 1982 on obligations for federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs excluding those for emergency relief and three emergency bridge projects consequently outlays for the federalaid highway program would be reduced by 500 million as compared to the budget resolution assumption of only 185 million in outlay savings in the area of highway safety the committees reconciliation proposal reduces total budget authority available for highway safety programs in fiscal year 1982 by 308 million the committee also proposed a 110 million obligation ceiling on highway safety programs in the next fiscal year budget authority for public mass transportation was reduced by the committee from that provided in the urban mass transportation act to levels anticipated by the budget resolution thus the committee achieved a 1 321 million savings in budget authority and an anticipated 200 million outlay savings in fiscal year 1982 in water pollution control programs the committee complied with the budget resolution conference reports assumption and recommended deleting the 5 billion now authorized for the environmental protection agencys construction grants program which assists municipalities in constructing publicly owned sewage treatment plants however the committee proposed a 100 million authorization to insure that states will be able to continue administering those portions of the program delegated to them for epas nonenergy research and development programs and for abatement control and compliance activities in fiscal year 1982 the committee recommended a 540 million authorization 209 million less than the amount in the congressional budget office baseline the committee recommended that funds for construction of corps of engineers water resources projects not exceed 1 588 million in fiscal year 1982 representing a reduction of 20 million more than assumed in the conference report funding for all programs authorized by the 1965 public works and economic

1981 represents a kind of a domestic salt agreement between big business and big labor an agreement which is likely to be disliked by each but which should work to the stark advantage of the individual citizen and taxpayer it is debatable how nefarious or constructive pac participation has been in recent campaigns but if the fivefold increase in total pac giving to congressional campaigns since 1974 is a guide to the future it would appear thatboth labor and business pacs are girding for future armageddonspolitical campaigns that in quantum magnitudes are likely to be more expensive than americans have ever experienced if this trend toward more expensive races and thus heavier financial obligations for candidates is not curbed individuals elected to the congress of the united states will increasingly become indebted to either big business or big labor congress will become a legislative body where the small businessman the farmer the worker and ordinary citizen are only

companies that discussions in congress of tax cuts all too often lack reference to tax equity and that inflaton iiq the economice issue of the day i would like to stress this last point inflation is not unrelated to campaign financing abuses the roots of inflation begin in federal spending and federal spending begins in promises and obligations and all this begins with politicians it begins in the way campaigns are run in politics as usual in commitments to large contributors no matter who they are in america today the most effective way for a candidate to achieve support in a bid for legislative office is to isolate every identifiable groupespecial ly moneyed groupsand announce support for that groups vested interest unfortunately going along with the most powerful interest groups inevitably leads either to the proliferation of federal programs or to the weakening of the tax structure fisal balance and equitability are impossible to maintain after lawmakers that is the successful candidates have committed themselves in advance to support specific tax advantages or government programs favoring those having made generous campaign contributions america may be a society of individuals but power groupingsnot individualsare represented in legislative bodies where money is the key determinant of election outcome a government of the people by the people and for the people cannot be a government where influence6 is purchasable through substantial camnpaign contributions the subordination of individual rights to indiscriminate moneyed influence is the subordination of representative democracy to institutional oligarchy it is simply a fact of life that when big money in the form of group contributions enters the political arena big obligations are entertained groups seldom reflect the same collective judgment as all their members this is particularly true in labor unions today where more than 95 percent of labor pac funds go to candidates of one political party but where in many instances almost half the actual membership vote goes to candidates of the other but this problem is not exclusively one of labor leadership being out of step with membership it is also true in many farm and corporate organizations where not infrequently individual farners and corporate executives oppose the very candidates who the managers of their pacs support this membershipleadership divergence of judgment is natural and largely irreconcilable since uniformity of views regarding political parties and candidates is not a hallmark of any part of the american free enterprise system as we know it today if pac funding battles go unchecked however it is quite conceivable that american political parties could increasingly become copies of european parties and that group selfinterests rather than individual views will be fought out in the ele~ctoral process decisions for most organizations occur at the top not the bottom of the leadership ladder and whether it be a corporate or union pac there is implicit peer or advancement pressure to contribute in the case of larger corporations and unions abdication of local control over funds leads to the aggrandizement of power for a very few within organizations and thus within any governm~ent channel where the organizations impact is felt individuals who control other peoples money become power brokers in an elitist society their views not the small contributors to their association become the views that carry influence our forefathers designed a representative democracy for americaa democracy where the particular views of every state and congressional subdivision would be reflected in the legislative process but the views of powerbrokers who control pac funds are frequently the views of outofstate interests rather than the concerns of individual constituents the giving of a significant policy voice to people who have no ties with the state or area from which a member of congress is elected is one of the most unfortunate ingredients of modern politics it weakens constituent ties to a representative once elected it also undercuts the desire of constituents either to contribute campaign funds in modest amounts or participate enthusiastically in volunteer activity this outofstate giving problem is more than theoretical fancy it is forcefully relevant to the nuts and bolts politics of rural america today in my home state of iowa for instance it is impressive how often in the last decade candidates for office from both principal political parties have found a determinative portion of their financial support coining from corporate or union groupings with few ties to the agricultural and small business base that is iowas heritage finally it should be stressed that without prudent restrictions on fac giving there is a clear danger that large numbers of challengers will never be given a reasonable competitive chance the stultification of incumbency will continue as the hallmark of congressional elections statistically by a 3 3to1 margin in the last congressional election pac funds were doled out to one definable group namely incumbents in a sense all members of congress have a common incumbency selfinteresta selfinterest which amounts to the exercise of monopoly power as the 86 percent electoral success of congressional incumbents in the five elections of the 1970s so vividly evidences monopolies in the political arena apparently can only be broken up by the exercise of countervailing monopoly powerthat is labor versus business

and time consuming to make this change at this time and i think the gentlemans statement is right on target when the rousselot amendment was offered last october i voted for it so did 253 of my colleagues since that time i have done more homework on the issue i have concluded that i cannot support this amendment to the urgent supplemental appropriation i havealways believed that the free enterprise system cannot survive if it is entangled in excessive regulation but it also cannot survive if it fails to meet its responsibility to protect the safety and health of workers and that is the fundamental issue here how can we best protect the workers in surface stone sand and gravel mining the argument for this amendment is that with msha barred from using its funds to inspect and regulate certain surface mines osha will automatically have the authority to step in and fill the breach i know that my colleague from california mr rousselot can cite an impressive number of cases to try to show that this is so but i must point out that there are many doubts about this argument it has been suggested that under the rousselot language osha does not have the authority to take over from msha i do not pretend to have a definitive contribution to make in this debate but given the disagreements between honest men and women of good will i am certain of one thing the lawyers will have their hands full the losers will be the workers whose safety may be jeopardized so long as the matter is disputed as labor secretary donovan has written resolution of this litigation may take some time while this or any other issue is being litigated the contesting operator need not comply with an osra abatement order some of my colleagues have pointed out if the legal problems are so complex how come all that litigation hasnt surfaced yet the answer is that osha has not yet gone full speed ahead into mine inspection osha is only now attempting to take mshas place and we are feeling the calm before the storm when osha starts to inpsect in earnest industry and labor alike will be consulting their lawyers more often i recognize that a completely different scenario is possiblethere may be little or no litigation this could come about if osha is unable to take mshas place this would leave mines uninspected and workers unprotected when msha was inspecting surface mines there were over 1 800 inspections between january 1 and april 1 1981 in the same time period this year osha has performed only 17 inspections all of oshas were in response to complaints or fatalities there were no routine general inspections i know that secretary donovan has assured my colleagues that he will do his best to equip osha for the task of surface mine inspection my fear is that realistically he may not be able to achieve that goal the proposed rousselot amendment transfers many of mshas responsibilities to osha but none of its funding last december secretary donovan pointed out that this would be costly complex and time consuminginspectors would have to be trained new rules and regulations would have to be promulgated and inspections would have to be scheduled and madeall within oshas present resources last december these obstacles were so worrisome that secretary donovan said he did not think osha should take over mshas surface mining responsibilities the possible outcomes then are not very appealingwe face legal problenis over oshas authority to regulate surface mines and administrative problems involving oshas ability to enforce that authority if indeed it exists i am afraid that despite good intentions all around the safety of workers may be at risk if this amendment is adopted and where human lives are at stake i do not think we can afford

implications for 1983 and 1984 it is well within the omnibus reconciliation act of 1983 and 1984 today i ask the house to favorably consider a bill to aid american indians in their postsecondary efforts i support this measure principally because i know what a positive effect such community colleges can have in rural isolated areas in my own district in appalachia the growth of these schools has meant a brighter future both personally and economically for their students and the region this program of support to tribal colleges located on very depressed reservations has already shown the progress and promise the amendments to the program proposed today are the result of hours of research discussion and consideration i am sure that they will improve the program i will not take ip the houses time with a lengthy discussion of this measure it remains practically identical to the bill as reported by the committee on education and labor the major thrust of these amendments is the clarification of the congressional intent for the program and the simplification of administrative provisions the conferees also agreed to senate provisions to aid in the development of facilities and to epcourage these schools to seek and obtain outside nonfederal endowment funding finally the program is extended at its present levels for 3 years this will greatly aid the schools in obtaining full accreditation the major provisions of the conference report are a tribe would now define its membership for the purposes of the program the method of computation of the number of students to credit to a school for the purposes of the formula to be multiplied by 4 000 is simplified the bill states that this program is pursuant to the federal trust responsibility as it relates to indian education planning grants are authorized for tribes that wish to examine the possibility of establishing a community college the amount authorized per fulltime equivalent student is adjusted for the fiscal years 1985 1986 and 1987 to reflect costofliving increases for the first time since the program started new schools may not enter the program if this will reduce the prestudent amount of the participating schools the perstudent amount has fallen steadily each year since the program started further continuing reductions would seriously threaten the accreditation prospects the program quality and even the continued existence of the participating schools the bill provides for assessment of available structures and for renovation to the colleges use where possible money for new construction would be made available for fiscal years 1985 1986 and 1987 on a matching basis a 4to1 match four parts federal to one part tribal endowment funds are authorized at 5 million per year for

the loaning of equipment and the providing of personnel in the continental united states so i commend the gentleman i just want to make one additional point the gentleman referred to the arrest and seizure and search aspect of the bennett language i might point out to my colleagues that the bennett language permits arrests and seizure but not search authority now that means if in fact the military were utilized as envisioned by the gentleman from florida in making a direct arrest or seizure there would be no authority to search that means in effect that if the arresting military official wanted to ascertain whether the people that he confronted had weapons he would not have the right to search he would not have the right to search in any other part of the vessel for instance under the language of the bill because it is strictly limited to arrest and seizure now i am sure that that was inadvertent but it points out just exactly why we should not be designing language of this nature without giving it very careful thought it is that precise reason why we are trying to avoid a confrontational situation and all the problems inherent in an arrest situation so i commend

are aware the secretary of engery recently announced that the federal government would help support part of the cleanup activities at the three mile island nuclear powerplant in his announcement the secretary indicted that the administration would request a total of 123 million over the next 3 to 4 years to fund various research and development activities at the damaged generating station this funding would be used to provide technical assistance in the cleanup of the water in the building basement remove and dispose of abnormal wastes riot disposable at commercial sites remove and evaluate the damaged reactor core and develop special tooling needed for early access for several reasons i believe it would be unwise and inappropriate to support this program at this time along with my fellow members of the committee on science and technology i have always strongly supported our nations efforts to become energy independent our inability and unwillingness to face our energy problems in the last 7 years has had many serious repercussions the energy crisis has drained the financial strength of our country and seriously threatens our national security events make it imperative that we press forward with the development of our domestic epergy resources we must now take advantage of the potential billions of barrels of oil shale tar sands and heavy oil deposits and the vast abundance of coal reserves which lie in our country the science committee has heard a great deal of encouraging testimony of the unlimited potential of these and other inexhaustible energy resources such as solar and fusion energy it is certainly i our nations best interests to continue to pursue the development of these various energy resources however regardless of what role nuclear fission should play in our future energy mix there are several compelling reasons why the federal government should not support the cleanup of the damaged three mile island tmi reactor unit first and foremost funding a tmi research and development program would be incompatible with the administrations energy philosophy this philosophy rests on the basic premise that the federal government should only support longrange highrisk research and development activities the administration believes that the federal government should not compete with industry in the development and commercialization of energy technologies which have already proven to be viable and are either in the marketplace or near commercialization this cleanup program would particularly be at odds with this philosophy it seems clear that the 70 or more nuclear plants in commercial operation today make nuclear power a commercial technology the record of commercial nuclear power is well known given the specific circumstances surrounding the tmi accident it is even more clear that the financial responsibility for this mishap must rest with those who produced and used the electric power this has been the case in other circumstances such as the nuclear regulatory commission levying a fine on a nuclear utility for an infraction of its regulations according to the report of the presidents commission on the accident at three mile island the kemeny report the opu service corporation qpusc has final responsibility for the design of the plant however by its own account it lacked the staff or expertise in certain areas to discharge that responsibility once construction was complete gpusc turned the plant over to met ed metropolitan edison company the operator and part owner of the three mile island nuclear powerplant to run but met ed did not have sufficient knowledge expertise and personnel to operate the plant or maintain it adequately the kemeny report goes on further to f ind thatin conclusion while the major factor that turned this incident into a serious accident was inappropriate operator action many factors contributed to the action of the operators such as deficiencies in their training lack of clarity in their operating procedures failure of organizations to learn the proper lessons from previous incidents and deficiencies in the design of the control room these shortcomings are attributable to the utility to suppliers of equipment and ito the federal commission that regulates nuclear power thereforegiven ail the above deficiencies we are convinced that an accident like three mile island was eventually inevitable based upon this report the utility certainly had responsibility for this most unfortunate accident and i believe they should be held strictly accountable my second concern with this research and development program is with the funding implications that would result budgetary pressures have presented the congress this fiscal year with many hard choices especially in the energy area the recent increases in inflation and our overall economic situation have made it painfully clear to us that our nation is in the midst of severe and deep economic troubles while recognizing that an effective energy research and development program is in our best national interests i believe that it is obvious that drastic action is necessary to get the economy back under control this action must include reductions in federal spending and every agency and every program will have to take its fair share of cuts no matter how attractive the individual activities sound on their own merits in light of these concerns i have supported the energy program approved by the science committee that calls for an aggressive effort in all of our nations energy research and development programs overall the committee authorized over 1 56 billion for nuclear energy r d compared to 1 02 billion for fossil solar geothermal lowhead hydrotpower and conservation research and development programs we also authorized funding for many other important energy programs including 376 million for the state and local conservation grant programs and other conservation activities our energy programs will certainly face close scrutiny in the years ahead and many more tough funding decisions will have to be made it would be a mistake to tip this balance toward one energy form or another taking into account our severe budget constraints i do not believe that we can afford to commit ourselves to this new nuclear program and still be able to maintain a wellbalanced energy program that will allow us to fully take advantage of all of our domestic energy resources while it is apparent that the federal government cannot and should not directly support the cleanup of this tragic accident all would agree that there is still an urgent need to proceed with the cleanup of this accident in the most expeditious manner possible public health and safety are in jeopardy as long as this plant remains contaminated in this regard i believe that there are several other viable options available to help us proceed with this task one possible option that has been suggested would be the establishment of a national insurance program for nuclear powerplant property this option would help us avoid any government bailout for the cleanup of nuclear accidents and apportion the costs of any such accident on an equitable basis to those who really benefit from this activity i would encourage my colleagues to consider this possibility as well as other alternative solutions as we face this important nuclear issue in the months ahead our budget can ill afford any more subsidies for nuclear energy"], [0.0034692883491516113, 0.4965307116508484, 1, "i
