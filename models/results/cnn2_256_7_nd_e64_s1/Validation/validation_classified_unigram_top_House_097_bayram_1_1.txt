million for the senior companion program while i support these funding levels i wish to raise the concurrent concerns that i have with the way action has been administering these programs especially the poster grandparent program the agency under the aegis of better management practices has been attempting to decentralize a number of foster grandparent programs which are operated by state agencies and supplemented by state dollars the net effect of this decentralization while on its face it is supposed to allow programs to be run at the local level with community sponsorswould be to reduce or close down a number of pg programs and thus depriving many of the developmentally disabled children served under this worthy program from services it would also terminate many of the volunteers who depend upon these programs for a daily opportunity to feel useful and to feel useful and to feel productive in addition these volunteer receive a host of related services from statesponsored programs such as transportation and daily meals that they might otherwise not receive under locally run programs with sponsors who have little experience or resources in this area of personal concern to myself is the imminent crisis facing the new york state foster grandparent program sponsored by the states office of mental retardation and developmental disabilities for the past 10 years this agency has been successfully providing services to more than 1 000 developmentally disabled children through more than 530 foster grandparents in 11 counties of the state action has announced its intention to terminate this grant to omrdd on february 28 1983 despite the fact that they have not acquired alternative sponsors to provide the service in the 11 counties action contends that no current services will be reduced by this move but the fact is that some 2 5 million in state funds would be jeopardized this is because the state appropriation for this program cannot be transferred under contract to communitybased organizationswhich is the only way the program could expect to be continued since local units of government would be especially hard pressed to secure the necessary local revenues during fiscal year 1983 it would be my intention to pursue this issue further if a continuing appropriations measure becomes necessary prior to the adjournment of congress for this session i have been advised that action plans to begin decentralization in a number of other states which have state agency sponsors21 in alland i believe that we must send a strong message to

flouse joint resolution 220 favorably to the house of representatives i regret that it is necessary to stand in opposition to legislation which is emotionally and politically charged and which appeals to the humanitarian instincts and principles which we all share this opposition can easily be misunderstood or misconstrue to reflect a lack of appreciation for the heroic acts of a fine person under the most difficult of circumstances my opposition is based on other most fundamental considerations i perceive and i cherish american citizenship as the highest honor that our country can confer upon a person who is a citizen of another land the granting of that citizenship is the admission and welcoming of thati person into our national family it mnust not be lightly bestowed and the granting of it certainly should never be used as an acknowledgement of appreciation for in doing so we would be diminishing and demeaning the citizenship of those of us who have bfeen born to this land and to the millions before us who have supported the principles we stand for and have fought and died to fireserve for our country our founding fathers considered citizenship important enough to provide in our constitution that no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at tlie time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of presidvrnt as members of the congress we all have had cases brought to our attention of persons who have come here as immigrants aind sought to become naturalized citizens but who because of some past transgression or technicality have been unable to qualify and many of us have used our efforts through private legislation and otherwise to assist those people who have done everything within their power to become american citizens as i have reviewed this legislation i have experienced a feeling of pride in mr wallenbergs fine work he was a swedish citizen all of my ancestors were swedish and i suppose that that ethnic kinship should evoke in me some special feeling of affinity with him it does but not enough to dhminish by one whit the importance of anerican citizenship as i perceive it and i am not alone in perceiving ani rican citizenship as something not to be treated lightly that feeling has been shared by millions of americans our capitol building of which we are so proud was decorated in large part by a naturalized american citizen an italian immigrant named constantino brumidi those who know and love the capitol know and cherish the memory of brumidi brumidi spent most of his life painting the senate wing of the capitol the capitol dome and some other areas the most cherished thing in his life was his american citizenship one of his paintings is the feature of the members private dining room and is signed c brumidi artist citizen of the unitedstates lbrumidi regarded his american citizenship with the greatest of pride and with him i agree our history is replete with instances of fine people who did a great deal for our country yet to them we have not extended american citizenship the marquis de lafayette helped us achieve our independence 200 years ago in his case as in that of our founding fathers he pledged to america his life his fortune and his sacred honor yet we did not grant him american citizenship and then there was casimir pulaski who was also prominent in the american revolution did we extend him american citizenship how about those who have been awarded the congressional medal of honor the highest tangible award that our country can give which is awarded only for bravery above and heyond the call of duty i have been informed that not all of the more than 3 400 who received this medal were american citizens have we conveyed american citizenship upon them i experienced a feeling of pride that mr wallenberg devised a safe conduct passport to make it possible for those whom he helped to escape from hitlers terror it was a remarkable procedure though not without precedent history remembers that during the years immediately after world war i thirty yearsbefore wallenberg another scandinavian the great fridtjof nansen of norway devised a similar passport known historically as the nansen passport to enable many victims of the turkish genocide of the armenian people to escape from the middle east and emigrate to other areas including the united states where many of them today are american citizens some of the cider refugees from that first holocaust have shown me with pride their nansen passports to america we have not made fridtjof nansen an american citizen in the argument favoring the granting of citizenship in this case it was recalled that the united states once granted honorary american citizenship to winston churchill that in fact was the one and only situation in which an honorary american citizenship has ever been granted the importance and intensity of mr churchills relationship to the united states during the period of world war 11 is common kiiowledge and if anyone ever earned honorary citizenship it would have been churchill also churchilli mother was an american citizen which is a significant added factor and in addition he had consented to receiving the honor despite those facts if i had been here in the congress at that time i would not have voted for his honorary citizenship the history of world war ii and its aftermath is filled with the stories of heroic actions by people guided by humanitarian principles we should commend them we should revere them we should remember them and their deeds and we should try to emulate them but that does not mean that we must give away american citizenship to those people i am sure that mr wallenberg was proud of his swedish citizenship as all of us are proud of our american citizenship and i also believe that mr wallenberg did not have need of an additional honorary citizenship to make himself whole any more than any of us feel the need for an honorary citizenship in some foreign land that is true of patriotic people everywhere i do not take away in any respect from raoul wallenberg for the fine and courageous work be did in enabling many to escape from the death camps of adolph hitler his courage his heroic actions are beyond dispute his career and his qualifications are not the issue here the question is whether american citizenship should be granted in recognition so far as we know mr wallenberg has never been in the united states he has never done anything specifically for the united states he has never asked for american citizenship we do not know whether he would want this honor we do not even know if he is alive i cannot believe that we should convey the highest honor that america can convey upon a person under those circumstances finally i feel that there are some things in life which are beyond giving atway it is my view that there are some things which we in the congress simply have nio right to give away and one of those is american citizenship american citizenship is a status which belongs to american citizens everywhere it is not our property to be given away for reasons of emotional and political gratification it is unique the patrimony of the american people and something for us to hold in trust my conscience tells me that i must not and cannot vote for this bill and

and certainly much less for a person in a wheelchair there were some skeptics among my staff members who were not sure that it would be possible to accommodate disabled persons under those circumstances there were others however including me who felt that it was all simply a matter of attitudeif you want it done you do it the first barrier that we had to overcome was to find handicapped housinghousing that is accessible to a wheelchair i must say that i have been disappointed to find such a lack of handicapped housing in the nations capital in fact the young man who is confined to a wheelchair has been forced to begin work later than he wanted because it took him so long to find handicapped housing the second barrier we had to overcome was finding appropriate office furniture that would accommodate a wheelchair property supply said that they had no desks for a handicapped person we have also worked that out i must admit however that it has been the drive and perseverence of the young staffer who is disabled more than anything else that has enabled him to come work for me it is a shame that society as a whole has not done more to make way for disabled persons but at least progress is being made the second young man i have hired to coordinate my activities as chairman of the greater lansing council for the iydp is a vietnam veteran who lost his leg in the vietnam war i serve on the house veterans committee and i have worked closely with the disabled american veterans of america and the paralyzed veterans of america the veterarrs affairs committee daily addresses the needs of thousands of disabled veterans as a member of the subcommittee on hospitals and health care of the house veterans affairs committee i have asked for oversight hearings on prosthetic and spinal cord research congressman ron mottl chairman of the subcommittee has enthusiastical ly agreed to hold those hearings which will take piace sometime in november of this year on april 24 and 25 the planners of the iydp in the state of michigan are holding a conference i will be attending that meeting and chairing a meet ing of all handicapped groups in the greater lansing area to map out plans for our local promotion of the iydp i believe that each of us can do something to promote access for disabled persons to mainstream them into society but perhaps the most important contribution we can each make is to look at our own attitude toward disabled persons in our community at home or at work for ultimately the best any one of us can do and the most a disabled persons asks from us is to be treated as an equal fittingly the iydp logo represents two people in a position of equality joining hands in solidarity and support of each other this is what we hope to accomplish during this year of special recognition for disabled persons and we believe that the resolution before us today will help to foster that goal i urge passage of the resolution"],

contained a 3 billion housing subsidy the president strongly objected t6 that provision and i agreed with his position and voted to sustain the veto however i said at that time that my support extended only to the housing provision the urgent supplemental which is now before the house does not contain the 3 billion housing subsidy i support this bill and i will vote to override the presidents veto this bill contains some 44 individual items totaling 5 9 billion in budget authority 5 7 billion in rescissions 36 million in transfers and 8 million for the liquidation of 1981 obligations the bill reimposes the 3 000 limit on tax deductions for members living expenses on a bill which contains that many items and that much money the position of any member must be a matter of individual conscience and individual judgment my own judgment is that this bill should be enacted into law the objections of the president notwithstanding we have been debating urgent supplementals since march and on at least 4 different bills so i would like to takxe a minute to summarize for the members of the house the items contained in the bill before us first of all the bill contains 15 separate items which have been designated as urgent by the administration 3 billion for food stamps urgent transfers for programs in the department of labor and the department of health and human services appropriations for the pell grant program in the department of education 2 4 billion for epa construction grants urgent appropriations for the cab the icc the merit systems protection board administrative expenses in the department of commerce social security mailing costs the unitedstates customs service the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and 1 billion for food stamps the bill contains a number of other appropriations which have been added by the congress 63 million for summer youth employment 210 million for community service employment for older americans 00 million for health services 57 million for the work incentives program 23 million for refugee assistance 24 million for the corporation for public broadcasting 150 for the government national mortage association 48 million for the coast guard 103 million for the federal highway administration 2 7 million for the secret service 62 million for the postal service 6 5 million for the national archives and records service 1 5 million for the tax court 2 million for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for weather stations 40 million for the corps of engineers for use in the mount st helens area i believe the president was right to veto the first urgent supplemental the bailout for the housing industry was a precedent we simply could not afford to set i supported him on that issue and on that issue alone the bailout issue has been settled in the presidents favor the first urgent supplemental was reported by the committee on appropriations in march since that time the urgent supplementals for fiscal 1982 have been frustrated and delayed by 4 months of demogogery and political chicken it is easy to see the importance of 1 3 billion for student loans it is not so easy to see the consequences for innocent federal workers the merit systems protection board has been forced to furlough some 300 workers those workers are in effect being paid half time i ask my colleagues how would you like to support your families and to pay your bills on halftime pay these employees and others have suffered enough from the political games that have been played with these supplementals this bill should be enacted and i will vote to override the veto because of the delay in final enactment of this urgent supplemental appropriations bill the merit systems protection board has been forced to curtail its operations drastically and place its employees on halftime halfpay furloughs inasmuch as there was no certainty as to when or whether the urgent supplemental would be passed the board had to slow its rate of spending remaining funds in order to allow for a skeletal operation to continue if the urgent supplemental question is settled the board will be able to resume full operations with the supplemental funds and it will be able to use the remaining funds under the continuing resolution to pay its employees for the time lost due to the emergency situation it is my understanding that an agency may place employees on administrative leave or excused absence for short periods of time when i has been forced to shut down in whole or in part for emergency or management reaspns in this case the boards furlough was forced by its efforts to maintain a minimal level of operations when there were no assurances that a supplemental appropriation would be approved and signed thus allowing the necessary funds for fulltime operations it seems to me that the board took the only reasonable course available to it under the circumstances when it furloughed its employees instead of spending ahead as if everything was a certainty they attempted to stretch out their remaining funds in case there was no urgent supplemental it would be unfair to penalize the employees because of the failure of congress to pass the necessary legislation to allow the board to operate atfull scale i consider the boards action to be responsible management and in my opinion once the urgent supplemental is passed and available to the board the furlough should be treated as a situation justifying administrative leave or excused absence so that employees can be justly paid"],

which reauthorize appropriations to enable the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to process mining explorer licenses to begin to formulate rules for commercial recovery permits and to conduct necessary research to assess the impact of such exploration and recovery on the environment however we must recall that the united states is not the only state concerned about mining the

handful of others did not including several of our allies the latter may change their minds and sign the convention in the next few months more than enough states signed that convention to enable the preparatory commission to begin its work on developing the rules and regulations under which seabed mining will take place under the proposed international seabed authority when the convention comes into force now it strikes me as very shortsighted of this adunistration not to participate in the work of the preparatory commission the united states is entitled to do so because our delegation signed the final act of the conference last week beyond this the rulemaking carried out by the united states is likely to have a bearing on the rules and regulations developed by the preparatory commission i am thinking here not only of rules for exploration and commercial recovery but in particular for environmental requirements which seabed mining companies as well as the enterprise should be obliged to observe in short the united states should contribute to this exercise the administration has already opted not to participate in the work of the preparatory commission but to devote its energies to negotiating a reciprocal mining regime with other mining states such behavoir is not becoming of a world leader rather we should make every effort to keep our hand in the continuing

burning oil to burning coal or fossil energy our long suit that it was improper to have them burning coal because as all of us know no matter what is put into an electric utilitywhether it be coal natural gas or oilwe only get half of the end product out of the other side there is a conversion penalty for changing that form of energy we decidedall of usit was in our national interest to try to convert those utility plants where we can and put them on coal and move them off oil and natural gas wherever it is in short supply where we have to import from the opec nations where we pay hundreds of billions of dollars guess what that seems like a pretty good program i have not seen anybody here who would argue with that there are no people in the budget to do it that is defeating that policy by a backdoor rip we are only talking about roughly four programs here conservationsome people think that is a pretty good program to work on some people can show you in dollars and cents that the

perspective on the leasing provisions of the 1981 tax act as he suggests the leasing provisions were included in the tax package primarily because in their absence the tax bill would have disproportionately benefited companies making a profit although at first glance it seems entirely logical to insure that unprofitable firms can take advantage of the income tax deductions and credits available to profitmaking corporations this bit of sophistry deserves closer scrutiny balling out losing companieshowever indirectlyamounts to a form of corporate welfare rewarding companies for losing money in a capitalist society to like selling indulgences for moral indiscretions in the middle ages it does not work a free enterprise economy is based on incentives and rapid corporate adaptiveness to the market place where noncompetitive practices are insulated from market decisions stultification of the economy is the inevitable result moreover as the leasing provisions were originally conceived the profitable company buying the tax breaks was to play a neutral role with the treasury being the loser and the unprofitable company receiving 90 percent or so of the advantages in practice however profitable firms appear to be getting about half of the advantages the recent ibmford deal provides useful illustration ford which sold its tax breaks for between 100 millionand 200 million received only 20 cents on the dollar ibm on the other hand is expected to make a profit of between 100 million and 200 million on its expenditure of a like amount in addition it should be stressed that acompany need not be unprofitable to take advantage of the leasing provisions as a result of sizable in vestment or foreign tax credits a profitable company may have amore tax benefits than i can apply to domestic earnings and it may offer these for sale thus occidental petroleum which paidno federal income tax despite 710 million in earnings in 1980 recently sold tax benefits stemming fromsome 95 million in capital equipment investments to tmarsh mclennan cos astheaccelerated cost depreciation schedules are phased in over the next few years the number of profitable companies with tax deduc tions and credits exceeding itheirt x liabilities and which are looking for tax ibreak buyers is bound to increase the lopsided advantage given to profitable companies in he ~bartering of tax losses together with the sanctioning of the sale of tax credits by profitable companies make mince meat of the original rationale for the leasing provisions the soleand

than the original estimate of 27 billion gossip in wall street is that it is becoming increasingly inex cusable for corporations mwith ingenious treasurers 1o pay taxes at all however ithe happy smiles of wall street treasurers are not reciprocated by the bookkeepers of mwain street en terprises to benefit from these leasing provisions companies apparently must be quite large as the recent scramble to package lease arrangements indicates corporate partners have almost exclusively been companies buying or selling multimilliondollar credits the problems of small business profitable or otherwise are lrelevant to this intricate tax provision what congress has done through this one complicated provision in the tax code is pass a corporate bailout measure 20 to 40 times the magnitude of the chrysler loan guarantee program one profound distinction however exists between the chrysler package and the leasing approach we are talking about today the former implies abailout of alarge corporation in financial difficulty the latter contains a novel precedent congress has approved a bailout for healthy companle3 as well liberals and the democratic party in particular have been discredited in recent elections 4because of an inability to make tough choices on spending policies too frequently the liberal position has been an undisciplined vote for more conservatives and the republican party today are challenged by an fandisciplined approach to tax cutting simply voting more for every tax cutting idea can have equally irresponsible effects on the deficit as simply voting more for every good spending idea now that the republican party has a mandate to govern ithas a responsibility to discipline itself on tax as well as spending policy the leasing provisions contained in the economic recovery tax act of 1981 can only be described as a legislative scandal congress has an obligation to take anew lookr at these provlsionsas well as at the reductions sanc tioned in the

majority of my colleagues saw fit to go forward with this legislation my distinguished colleague zeroed in on the issue of discrimination one of the factors we did discuss during that debate was the fact that it is extemely difficult to fashion registration or a draft that does not engage in some level of discrimination either at the level of race or at the level of class i do not think the amendment on the floor adequately addresses that i think my distinguished colleague from southern california spoke to that but let me before i amplify let me first say you quoted the new york times that saia substantial number of people hae not registered that is they have not comtnplied with the law you and i here can pass laws those laws will be adhered to by the american people if the american people respect those laws maybe the fact that we have a substantial number of people not registering is because there are millions of american people here who feel that this law is absurd and useless there are many fathers and mothers who feel that their children would be cannonfodder in some third world adventurism as our involvement in korea our involvement in vietnam and our potential involvement in el salvador people do not want their children used in that fashion i think we have to look at whether we were a reasonable group of people when we indeed enacted the law finally to the question of discrimination if we want to remove discrimination then let us treat all citizens before the law equally if any citizen in this country black brown red yellow white rich poor middle class working class if they choose to violate the law we have an apparatus that addresses that to go beyoni that to create at least the dichotomy of those persons in need of federal programs and those persons not i need of federal programs you have created a dichotomy that speaks to discrimination in conclusion i would simply say to my colleague that you and i agree that we should fight valiantly against any form of discrimination in this country at whatever level it comes race sex age geography class or whatever but you do not do that by creating this kind of a situation every american citizen young person who goes to college does not have to qualify for a loan so what have we done we have discriminated again to the benefit of those persons who have the economic wherewithal and political clout to move beyond it but middleclass individuals workingclass individuals workingpoor individuals and poor people in this country will be the only ones that will be affected by this kind of legislation i do not believe in that sort of double jeopardy if people violate the law we have an apparatus to go beyond that to harm people at that level does not remove the discrimination i would

in terms of the jobs it will create and the improvements that will be made in our highways and bridges this legislation also provides the means to meet that need by providing for the additional

allow us to finish the interstate system in the next 10 years meet most of our critical repair needs and rehabilitate all of those bridges now classified as structurally weak or too narrow for present day traffic these funds will be distributed through existing highway programs so that the effect can be felt this spring there will be no long delays while we create new bureaucracies and mountains of new regulations and that is the real key to this program having an immediate impact on the economy that will be positive for those out of work this legislation has been criticized because it does not do enough to resolve our unemployment problems it is true that 320 000 jobs do not put a very large dent in unemployment of 12 million but part of our failure to meet recessionary jobs needs in the past has been our penchant for massive programs that hold out the hope of the ultimate solution and do nothing more than bring on another round of inflation meeting the unemployment problem means attacking it on many fronts not just one this is but one frontal attack there are a number of other innovative and fiscally responsible ways to address unemployment and i hope the new congress will put them at the top of the priority list i hope we will not be so irresponsible as to try to solve the entire problem with one grandiose sweep of our magic wand i urge my colleagues to take this major step and enact this legislation"], [0.001565098762512207, 0.5015650987625122, 1, "i think it would be demonstrated by reference to this chart that we have indeed reduced total authorizations by some 4 million below the amount authorized last year that is what this is of course it is an authorization to compare an authorization with another authorization is to compare an apple with an apple to compare an authorization with the previous years expenditure would be to compare an apple with an orange so we are comparing apples with apples and we are also doing exactly what the other body did when we reduce by 10 percent the total amount authorized last year i would suggest once again that i think that represents in real terms a reduction of some 15 or 16 or perhaps 17 percent in the amount available to each of the committees of the house we have tried to do this with some discretion not every committee has exactly the same burden this year as it had last year not every committee is being called upon for the same additional obligations this year obviously this year the committee on armed services is being called upon to exercise jurisdiction over a much larger budget and over new recommendations coming from the president of the united states therefore we are recommending not a cut but an increase of some 15 percent in the amount of money available for the committee on armed services in that sense we propose exactly what the house administration committee recommended for that purpose the largest single percentage cut interestingly enough is a cut of 31 percent which was voluntarily assumed by the house administration committee itself honoring the action of the house administration committee we propose no change and certainly no further cut beyond the 31percent reduction voluntarily assumed by that committee in its own operating amounts the next largest would be a reduction of some 24 percent in the amounts available for what is known as the house information services that is a conglomerate activity that has grown very rapidly mushrooming into almost a 10 million authorization last year and so we believe that it could sustain a reduction and we have asked that a 24percent reduction be applied a 14percent reduction has been accepted by the committee on rules below the amourit that was authorized last year so the important committees of the housethose which have had some purview already over this legislationare demonstrating a good example the committee on house administration and the committee on rules notably among them have voluntarily accepted larger than average cuts in order that some of the other committees charged with heavier than usual responsibilities might not have to assume cuts quite so large in that connection i would like to suggest that the committee on ways and means which obviously has a larger burden than most committees in this particular congress faced as it is with a proliferation of recommendations for reductions in taxes should not be reduced below the amount of last years authorization we think that it definitely is prudence and frugality that the committee is not raised and it is not raised it is allowed exactly the same amount under this amendment that it was allowed last year i want to suggest only that in the amendment which will be offered in the form of a motion to recommit by the republican side the gentleman from minnesota would reduce the committee on ways and means by some 500 000 approximately a halfmillion dollars or a 20percent reduction we believe that the committee on veterans affairs should not be required to sustain a large reduction and yet the amendment to be offered in the form of a motion to recommit by the gentleman from minnesota would reduce it by some 25 percent the committee on government operations which serves as our eyes and ears performs our oversight functions into the operations of the administrative branch of government would be reduced according to the piece of paper that purports to represent the figures that will be contained in the motion to recommit by the gentleman from minnesota by some 650 000 or a reduction of some 30 percent in the amount available for the committee on government operations and so it goes committee after committee based upon this it seems logical to me that the members of the house wanting to make a prudent reduction wanting to make a good and noble and worthwhile example wanting to show our willingness to tighten our own belts and our own capacity for selfrestraint and for selfdiscipline will want to support my amendment and thus to reduce the authorized amount by a total of 10 percent surely we will want to oppose the draconian cuts which would rob the committees of the congress of the muscle and the sinew and the bone that is necessary to conduct their functions at this point i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0017276406288146973, 0.5017276406288147, 1,

gentleman from texas mr bnooics has raised several points that can only be classified as red herrings designed to distract our attention from the real issue involved in section 909 as reported by the armed services committee while the arguments of those who favor junking this important aspect of the bill may sound factual we should recognize that there is somewhat of a spin on the balland a bit of fuzziness here and there for example those who would scuttle section 909 would have you believe that that provision would give the defense department free rein to spend one and a half trillion dollars over the next few yearsand that the congress would somehow lose control over the purse the facts are absolutely contrary to that argumentand so is the law in fact because os section 138 of title 10 of the united states code no funds may be appropriated obligated or expended for the procurement of any weapon system by the department of defense unless those funds are specifically authorized by law authorization for fiscal year 1982 in fact is the primary purpose of the bill before the house today trho people who want to kill section 909 are also apparently unaware of another provision of xisting law that provides for close oversight of department of defense procurement and research and development activities this is section 139 of title 10 under that law the department of defense must submit detailed cost and schedule reports to the congress on every weapon system required to be authorized by law in addition a supplemental report must be submitted not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to any contract award or the exercise of an option to procure a weapon system these reports are now made quarterly and are carefully reviewed by the committee on armed services and other committees there are two authorizing committees two appropriations committees two budget committees two government operations committees and the general accounting officeeight committeesall looking down the neck of the defense department in contrast who looks for welfare fraud in health and human services programs or bribery and kickbacks in the general services administration what other government agency has such congressional oversight another fuzzy argument would have us believe that section 909 wotild result in fencing in a large portion of the defense budget and result in loss of flexibility flexibility in the past has meant the brutalization of carefully planned programs through arbitrary program cuts and delays with no public exposure of the additonal costs of such actions in fact these cuts and delays are always advertised as savings we have paid dearly for this kind of flexibility and the almost total lack of discipline that it has introduced into the procurement process section 909 of the armed services committee would encourage the dod to introduce a measure of discipline into the procurement process this is the central issue that those who would have the house kill this provision are trying to obscure the point is that discipline always reduces flexibility from the teenager on an allowanceto the convict in prisonto the procurement of weapon systemsto the authorization and appropriation of funds by the congressfollowing an orderly set of priorities always reduces flexibility but is that bad is the improvement of the countrys defense at lower cost as bad as the opponents of section 909 would have us believe of course it is not let us be truthfulwith the taxpayers out there who want us to provide for an adequate defense but who also want us to spend our defense dollars more wisely let us tell them that yes we can buy some weapons 10 percent or 20 percent cheaper if we handle advance procurement differently or do the multiyear contracting that section 909 would authorize but if we kill section 909 let us also tell the taxpayers in our districts that we preferred to do business in the same old undiscipluned and expensive way that in the interest of not fencing in money we thought it better to fence out economy let us tell them what the extra costs of flexibility actually amount to let us tell them that we had the opportunity to save several billions of dollars but we passed up the opportunity because we refused to have the costs of arbitrary changes exposed this is the real issue here if we kill section 009 let us also tell them that we refused the advice of the last two secretaries of defense the general accounting office the congressional budget office and th office of management and budget the truth is that section909 is designed to foster econonly and efficiency in our government i would have thought that the committee of this house which has economy and efficiency as its primary concern would have vigorously embraced this provision but such has not been the case instead this provision along with others in thle armed services committee bill has been used as a weapon in the fight over the turf claimed by

civilian retirees on a par with annual adjustment in the social security system we will save 907 million in fiscal year 1982 and 2 8 billion over the next 3year period what do they do in the committee bill they say we will have once a year cola for the military retired if you have it for civilian employees and they call that a saving that is not a saving at all restoring the safety net character of the aid to families with dependernt children program will save 1 1 billion in fiscal year 1982 454 million more than the weaker provisions contained in the committee bill these entitlement reform proposals in this amendment are an essential element of federal spending control the comnittee provisions simply do not do the job the grammlatta budget resolution which passed this house overwhelmingly called for 7 2 billion in savings in this program in fiscal year 1982 rising to 11 8 billion in fiscal year 1984 and 29 billion for the 3 years combined yet the provisions crafted to deal with these eight programs fall far short of this mark cbo estimates that the committee provisions will save only 2 3 billion in 1982 and only 9 9 billion for fiscal year 198284 in other words the committee bill does only onethird of the job it was supposed to do and i will say to my colleagues that onethird is not good enough only by adopting this amendient and finally bringing entitlement spending under control can we finish the task we have set out for ourselves which is supported and backed by the great share of the american people now in recent weeks we have heard much weeping and walling from the proponents of the uncontrolled entitlement spending that controlling entitlements is just too hard that too much pain will be visited on the poor and the downtrodden yet the members of this house know in their hearts this is simply not true the types of entitlement reforms proposed in this amendment will still leave in piace a commonsense system of generous support to those who are truly in need of assistance the sort of income security programs that the congress designed when these programs began this amendment does not destroy basic income protections instead it only cuts the abuses and let me stress that once again it only cuts the abuses that have crept into the nations entitlement system in the last two decades of uncontrolled entitlement spending oh it would be nice it would be nice if we could do all of this that is if we could afford it it would be nice if we could afford it but we cannot afford it it would be nice if we could do this for everybody let everybody in on the gravy train but we cannot afford it inflation is eating us up the incomes of poor people and especially our senior citizens are being eaten away by inflation they cannot keep up income taxes keep increasing you cannot keep up interest rates are out of sight why because the federal government must go out into the money market every week to finance this huge federal debt now that does not make much sense and until we have the nerve to stand up and do something about it we are not going to correct it we have heard recently for example that our proposal would eliminate the minimum benefit addon in social security it will cut 3 million retirees off social security anyone who makes that claim simply does not understand the social security system eliminating the socalled minimum benefit will simply eliminate the unearned benefitand i stress that againthe unearned benefit addon for those whose earned social security amount is below an arbitrary threshold and that arbitrary threshold set by whom the congress no oneno one will have their benefits cut off instead they will receive exactly what they have earned they will receive exactly what they have earned under the social security system now the doubledippers whose benefits are low because they were too busy earning sizable government pensions to work in social security to have the employment for more than a few years this reduction will admittedly be an inconvenience but for the long incomed retirees whose low benefits are due to low lifetime earnings this change will be no hardship those with low retirement incomes are eligible for the ssi program ycu know it and i know it and this program provides them even more benefits than they receive under social security in fact when their social security benefits are reduced their income will be restored dollar for dollar by increased ssi payments speaking about social security benefits for adult students we have also heard that this amendment would strip orphans of the ability to go to school by cutting off their benefits after a few years when they reach the age of 18 those who make that claim seem to have no knowledge of the extensive program of support for student financial aid that the federal govern ment provides particularly for those with true financial needs the pell grant program for example will make up a substantial share of any lost benefits from those from lowincome families and i am sure that my colleagues will agree that this sort of program which takes educational need into account is a far better means of insuring support for higher education than the dwindling social security trust funds"]]}
