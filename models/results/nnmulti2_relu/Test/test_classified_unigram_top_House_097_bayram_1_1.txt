29 of this year as i have indicated earlier on the floor i sent the chairperson of the armed services committee a communication suggesting that we expand the parameters of the discussion in the debate in the armed services committee in light of the fact that this administration has proposed a military budget in excess of 1 6 trillion in the first 5 years of the decade of the 1980s and with the fact that millions of american people and millions of people around the world are raising significant questions with respect to our lockedstep effort toward thermal nuclear war i felt that we had a profound obligation to go beyond the parameters of the armed services connittee to hear from other witnesses who had a positive and constructive alternative to our present military policies in this country and around the world the chair sent back a polite letter indicating that for a number of bureaucratic reasons they had an obligation to go forward with the military budget i understood that and responded to the chair by indicating that it was my belief that it is a moral imperative that we establish a platform to provide an opportunity for brilliant minds to come together to pose an alternative to americas present military and nuclear policy therefore in april of this year we held 6 days of hearings to look at the full implications of the military budget we looked at the national security and foreign policy implications of the military budget the tactical and strategic implications of the military budget and arms escalation versus arms control we looked at the economic implications and the moral implications of the military budget we looked at the economic implications of americas global arms sales and finally we looked at citizen responsibility in ending the absurdity and the insanity of our nuclear arms race and our rapidly escalating military budget a number of brilliant witnesses came to washington from all around the country to testify at these hearings i would like briefly to give a few highlights that a number of the witnesses presented during those hearings in april the first witness was former senator j william fulbright of arkansas former chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee from 1959 to 1975 senator fulbright led off the hearings he stated as follows and i quote this budget together with the propaganda to sell it to the public and the congress has the effect of shifting the focus of our policy from that of deterrence of nuclear war to the waging and the winning of a nuclear war further quoting he said this military budget is so large and the emphasis upon nuclear weapons so strong and the rhetoric about the soviet threat is so extreme that one cannot resist the feeling that we are preparing to fight and win a nuclear war i believe if this is the case that it is a dangerous game and could easily get out of control and lead to a disaster it is not only dangerous it is costly and it threatens the stability and the soundness of our domestic economy mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified as follows there is no basis in fact for the assertion that the soviet union has strategic nuclear superiority we lead in strategic warheads again it really doesnt matter but we have a lead we also lead when it comes to survivable forces mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and dis irmament agency there is no credible scenario in which we and the soviet unioh could fviht a nuclear war and have either one of us be declared the winner either one of us might come out somewhat better than the other but we would be worse off than uganda or bangladesh we would no longer be recognized as superpowers in fact the question is would we be recognizable as a national entity ms randy forsberg president and executive director of the institute for defense and disarmanent studies pulling the nuclear tripwire ever tighter by improving first strike capabilities is extremely risky and dangerous if we continue to make nuclear escalation in a first strike format easier and more likely then in a crisis it will become inevitable clearly the stakes in the third world are not worth the risk to the whole of humanity what in the extraordinary is the hubris the arrogance the almost criminal carelessness of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence that they can play nuclear chicken forever without ever losing control of the situation once dr paul p walker charter member of the boston study group and coauthor of the price of defense the defense department states boldly that this naval plan is based on the determi nation to restore and maintain maritime superiority over the soviets in order to wage severa wars worldwide against the soviet military empire such planning is based on several false assumptions one that we have somehow lost naval supremacy two that overwhelming maritime superiority enhances nationql se curity and three that aircraft carriers around which the current fleet is designed continue to be the most effective way to build and deploy navies we can continue to fulfill our real national security goals with a no growth navy maintaining approximately a 400ship fleet by escalating to the proposed 640ship fleet i suggest we will

willard grimmn a well known merger expert who said that mergers of this type are primary tools for achieving comparies growth goals namely to lessen risk and obtain better cash flow the key phrase here is to lessen risk this from the industry that insists they need all those profits so they can throw the dice in search of more energy resources to free the united states from foreign sources these three companies i can assure you are not dice throwers and they are not out on the frontier of risk they are looking for the sure thing the instant winner or in the vernacular of the race track

tell you that it is better to use someone elses capital and not your own so of course most of the primary and secondary suitors have established lines of credit with their friends the bankers mobil

will mean to them and they have sent us a loud and clear message calling for the passage of the economic recovery program the success of this program depends on both tax rate reductions and budget cuts in a recent survey sent out to my entire congressional district constituency over 87 percent of those responding solidly supported the presidents proposal to reduce personal income taxes over the next 3 years the conablehance substitute provides for acrosstheboard marginal tax rate reductions of 5 percent on october 1 1981 with additional reductions of 10 percent on july 1 1982 and 10 percent on july 1 1983 the top marginal rate on investment income will be lowered from 70 percent to 50 percent effective january 1 1982 in order to rebuild americas industrial base and to balance the federal budget we must significantly reduce tax rates acrosstheboard by a multiyear tax bill lower taxes will definitely increase the opportunity for people to save and invest a greater part of their income reduced taxes encourages savings and will provide capital to create new jobs and increase productivity it has been said that the presidents tax proposal is a bill for the wealthy this is most certainly not true presently americans who are earning between 5 000 and 50 000 per year pay 67 percent of all taxes under the conablehance substitute these americans will receive 70 percent of the benefits cutting taxes and restoring fiscal responsibility to the federal government must be the top priorities of this congress a reduction in the federal income tax rate is critical to the economic

across the board on the energy and water appropriations this is what the effect will be this bill i might say should be on the presidents desk next week the continuing resolution then in that event would not have any effect if the bill is signed but i want to point out what the 5percent cut will mean to the funds in the continuing resolution it would cut 235 million below the house level for

service by discussing this issue it is an issue that the house of representatives seems more interested in ignoring than facing i think it is time for this house to turn back and start analyzing the kinds of issuet that the late honorable wright patman talked about for 30 years in this house and that is the structure of the federal reserve board i introduced a piece of legislation that i call the paul volcker retirement act i did that early in this congress i did not do it so much to focus on the chairman of the federal reserve board as a person as to talk about the institution of the federal reserve board and the inability of the people of this country who are in a governing position to deal with monetary policy as long as we have a federal reserve board that is completely and thoroughly independent i went back and read the things that have been written about the creation of the federal reserve board president wilson the democrats and the republicans in congress said we thought we ought to have a federal reserve board to try to stop and try to monitor some of these cantankerous practices of some of th local banks out there in the country but we sure do not want to be creating with this federal reserve board a strong independent bank here we are 70 years later and what we have is a strong independent bank accountable to no one federal reserve board members are appointed for a 14year term they are not accountable to the president they are not accountable to the congress they develop monetary policy at their own time in their own ways and consequently we come to a point in our history at which fiscal policy and monetary policy collide they are not united in a combined strategy that makes much sense for the future of this country we are told that high interest rates today are part of an economic solution in fact it is part of the economic problem some say use fiscal policy cut spending cut taxes and that will add up to a balanced budget it does not but that is the current fiscal policy strategy it is all based upon supplyside economics which means you need explosive bursts of economic growth to enable supplyside economics to work on the other hand you have monetary policy which is policy guaranteed to try and retard economic growth in the country that is why we have moved into a recession monetary policy is designed to retard economic growth so we have on the one hand fiscal policy which requires economic growth and substantial amounts of it to work and on the other hand we have monetary policy that retards economic growth and throws the country into a recession it is the most schizophrenic kind of economic policy that i have ever heard of in my life there are people in town who believe that somehow it will work it will not work it is economic faith healing it is wishbone economics it simply is not based on economic logic at all i want to say to the gentleman that his discussion of the structure of the federal reserve board is extraordinarily productive because that is what we need to be discussing today in congress tax cuts do not mean anything to a main street business person who is not earning a profit because he is paying 20percent interest rates you give him a tax cut and it does not mean a thing the fact is you only pay taxes if you earn f profit i do not know of many main street businesses in this country which are earning profits by having to pay 18 or 20 percent interest rates on the capital they need to operate their business that just is not happening so we are addressing the wrong thing it is like mowing your lawn while your house is burning the interest rates represents the burning house and we have to deal with interest rates in a structural way that gets right back to the issue the gentleman is talking about what ought the federal reserve boards role be in this government should it be an independent role capable of creating a strategy of monetary policy that is inconsistent with the fiscal policy strategy of course not that is not a reasonable approach i think it is time people in the congress begin realizing that this contradictory strategy of monetary and fiscal policy is not logical and will not work in conclusionand i appreciate the gentleman allowing me the time to visit about interest rates and monetary policyi would like to say further that the federal reserve board has put us in a position of starving the most productive sector of the american economy we starve from a credit standpoint the small business and the family farms and at the same time mobil oil co is out there getting 5 6 billion worth of credit to try to buy conoco now they are gobbling up credit to try to buy marathon oil there is not one new job created from that kind of activity there is no new productivity created from that kind of activity it is a completely useless and inefficient economic activity in this country the most productive segment of our economy is being starved and we are rewarding the least productive for the purposes of acquisition and concentration of corporate power chipping away at the free enterprise system none of that makes any sense so we do need a more coherent monetary strategy so that the folks in this country who need credit to build productive small businesses with to create new jobs with get that kind of credit only then can they have the kind of business that prospers and grows along with the economy of this country i do not think the president is solely to blame for the interest rates obviously the federal reserve board develops monetary policy but the fact is that the president has supported this monetary policy he has said so time and time and time again i heard some colleagues on the floor of this house just the other day talking about how this program is working this program is working they say well if this program is working the hindenburg is still trying to park and the titanic is still sailing the fact is this program is not working it has only been in force 40 or 50 days but already we have seen the estimates change on the expected fiscal year 1982 deficit from 42 billion to upward of 80 billion the fact is it will not work because we have inconsistent monetary and fiscal policies we have to get it straightened out but even more importantly we have to address the longterm structure of the federal reserve board that is why i think the gentleman is dead right i have not put my name to the current resolution the gentleman is speaking about but i have several bills of my own in and several resolutions in on the federal reserve board i commend the gentleman for bringing this to the attention of the house day after day after day as more people begin to understand that tight money is the problem not the

consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing

completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee

to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all points of order for

adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner

would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are

countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial

donordonee problem a problem that texas has historically experienced the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas and myself however attempts to correct one of the historic inequities of the federalaid highway program namely the situation which exists for the socalled donordonee states but we do so in a different manner than the chairman over the life of the federalaid highway program and the highway trust fund each state has contributed its share of gasoline tax and excise tax money to the highway trust fund this money is then apportioned among the various 50 states for programs under the federalaid highway system the distribution formulas of these revenues originally devised over 20 years ago are based on a number of factors including total lane miles and total vehicle miles traveled in a state unfortunately because of the failure of these distribution formulas to reflect other statistics many states are not receiving an adequate share of the revenue which they contribute for example my own state of texas will contribute an estimated 783 million in fiscal year 1983 but will only receive back 627 million according to this legislation this represents a return of approximately 968 for every dollar which texas contributes to the trust fund hardly an equitable return on this money our amendment would correct this situation in a way which would not take money away from any other states but would guarantee that each state receive at least 90 percent of its contributed revenues in this way states such as texas will be guaranteed an apportioned share of federalaid highway money which is directly proportional to its contribution level in keeping with this administrations and previous administrations philosophy and the priority of the public works and transportation committees priority of completing the interstate system by 1991 our amendment would exclude the interstate construction program and the interstate transfer program we feel strongly that the interstate is indeed a program of national scope and its completion should not be delayed or deterred in any way the 42 opmile interstate system which is now 95 percent complete provides vital transport and mobility for all of our nations citizens in addition to being one of the essential links to interstate commerce in our country in this regard we recognize and accept that some states will until completion of this system bear a disproportionate share of the cost however the apportionment inequity which now exists for the other federal aid highway programs such as the interstate 4r the urban secondary and primary categories cannot be justified as an overriding national priority rather because these moneys are spent on construction of roads and highways which directly serve the transportation needs of each state their distribution should reflect the diversity of these needs our amendment would correct the donordonee problem by guaranteeing qualifying donor states a minimum of 90 percent of their contributed revenues according to the federal highway administration the revenue needed to fund this guarantee for fiscal year 1984 would totad 225 million with subsequent fiscal years averaging approximately the sume amount this 225 million would be generated from two sources 125 million would come from the interstate transfer authorization and 100 million would come from the interstate discretionary authorization this money would then be spent by the secretary to supplement the trust fund shares of those donor states which do not receive at least 90 percent of their contributed revenues the recipient states would then be free to spend this additional money in whatever highway category they deem necessary an additional feature of this amendment is that it does not increase the authorization levels of this legislation i do not feel that with the deficit for fiscal year 1984 approaching 180 billion we can stand here and arbitrarily increase the spending levels of this legislation i find it unconscionable that with a 1983 authorization level of 12 1 billion we can even consider increasing the authorization levels any further it is because of this terrible deficit problem that our amendment would shift existing authorizations within this legislation to solve the donordonee problem and not increase the overall authorization levels it is only fitting and equitable that states should be receiving a proportionate and fair share of their contribution to the highway trust fund especially since the revenues collected for the trust fund reflect

their resolution to disapprove the sale of awacs to saudi arabia this debate is not just aboutsaudi arabia or awacs planes what we are debating is something far more profound and far reaching the decisions we make today combined with those to be made in the other body will have a deep and his tonec effect on our future as a power for peace in the mideast the heart of this issue is not awacs technology but foreign policy not the security of one type of aircraft but thb security of our nation the western alliance and our friends in the mideast let us look at some of the questions before us some say we should not give the saudi the awacs unless there are americans to man them others question the alleged insecurity of the awacs technology in saudi hands i recall a story i heard the other day a highranking administration of ficial was being questioned by a distinguished member of the other body about the awacs deal the administration official said to the senator if the saudi dont buy awacs from us theyll simply turn around and buy a similar plane from the british and the senator replied let them buy it from the british if thats what they want and so the administration official said if you have no objection to the saudi pos jessing the technology as such why not let the united states make the sale instead of great britain and the senators reply to that was my time is up and i have no further questions ~ a vote against this sale is not going to deprive the saudi arabians of sophisticated flying radar technology is there anyone who doubts the capacity of the british nimrod to eventually perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and monitoring the information on a xetltime basis is this what those opposed to the sale want i do not think so but it is exactly what they are going to get let history judge which side of this debate best served the cause of freedom peace and security"], [0.9598872661590576,

every effort to achieve the equality women have worked so hard for and certainly deserve like the right to vote the right to equality under the law will become part of the constitution i am proud to be among those to reintroduce the equal rights amendment in congress and continue tlfe campaign for its ratification confident of success the drive for the equal rights amendment has changed american politics never before have so many women raised so much money been so active in lobbying and campaigning and learned so much about politics according to pollster louis harris one of the major developments of this decade will be the fullblown emergence of women as a powerful new force in american politics public officials everywhere will be held accountable and those legislators who have voted against women will be replaced i would like to interject one anecdote while campaigning last weekend back in my district i went through a factory where there was an elderly gentleman who said that he had been working every day of his life and was thrilled that i was a congresswoman i asked why he said he had been working every day of his life to support his three daughters and he feels that when he passes away i will continue to support them in my own way one is a doctor one is a lawyer and the third a housewife with children he firmly believed that unless we had more women taking up the responsibilities and posijuy 14 1982 tions of women we would not be able to obtain that type of equality under the law that this gentleman believed was so very necessary the argument that we do not need the era because there are no longer any discriminatory laws is completely wrong genderbased laws can be as picayune as the north carolina statute that requires a husband but not a wife to go to court for a legal name change if the couple wants to use a combined or hyphenated name or the laws can be reflective of deeprooted stereotypes such as the georgia law that states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife i subject ot him married women are the big losers property rights marital regulations provisions for separation and divorce and statutes concerning wills and intestate succession combine to discriminate against womenwhether they are homemakers work in a familyowned business work outside the home are widowed are divorced or getting a divorce so despite the many rights that women have won over the past decade equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law are incomplete and impermanent the rights we have gained could be revoked by changes in the political balance of congress administrative action or a realinement of the supreme court without the era in the constitution the shift of a few votes could wipe out equal employment opportunity equal access to credit and equal education many womens rights were enacted by small margins for example the law that gives a woman the right to sue an employer who discriminates against her would not be on the books if three senators had changed their minds the reason the era has not yet been ratified is because a few state legislators who ignored the wishes of their constituents and a vast majority of citizens throughout the country these legislators bottled the era up in committee tied it up by parliamentary maneuver and used backroom political pressure to defeat it but those days are past i expect the new erawith the same simple straightforward languageto win approval in congress and then be ratified by the required 38 states state elections will make all the differencewith legislators who oppose era held accountable i believe the era drive will be looked upon as the turning point in the womens movement women will move from being spectators to the inside political track i firmly believe that era more than anything else is a bread and butter issue for women 70 percent of the nations poor are women according to the national advisory council on economic opportunity this figure could rise to 100 percent before 2000 thp irony of this decade of advancement for women is that it has also been the decade of the feminization of poverty while this is most prevalent among elderly black and hispanic women the fastest growing segment of poor women are single white and ralsing children with no or little support jobs alone are not the answer while mens poverty is a consequence of unemployment womens is the result of occupational segregation in spite of the fact that more women are employed now than ever before 80 percent of these women are concentrated in traditional womens work service and cler cal jobs which are not only low paying but have declined in real earnings for years the great strides made by women into traditionally male occupations chiefly reflects their

essential to restoring the trust of the american people in this congress at a time when citizens are increasingly distrustful of public officials at all levels of government it is vital that there be no taint of dishonor in the congress the most important legislative body in the land last years actions by the congress to increase substantially the compensation of its members were extremely disillusioning to millions of americans at a time when the president and the congress were asking tremendous sacrifices of most americansparticularly low and middleincome americanswe removed the limits on the tax deduction for expenses members incur by living in washington and we raised the outside earnings limitation which serves as a curb on the amount of money members may earn from special interests for making speeches writing articles et cetra in the senate that limit was eliminated entirely while in the house it was doubled to over 18 000 one of the worst aspects of this entire situation was that no separate rolleall vote was taken on any of these actions indeed with regard to the increase in the outside earnings limits in the house a rolleall vote taken only a few weeks before the increase was granted by a voice vote showed a solid majority of members opposing the increase only through subterfugeby bringing up the resolution without the knowledge or true consent of most memberswas this measure able to gain approval it has always been my belief that no salary increase enacted by the congress should take effect until the following congress is elected i feel this way for two reasons first there is an inherent conflict of interest in a specific congress voting itself a pay raise and second the voters should have an opportunity to endorse or reject an incumbent member or another cdndidate at the new actual salary members will earn throughout a new congress for this reason i have followed this policy myself since i entered the house in 1977 turning back pay increases until the voters of my district have had the chance to endorse or reject me at the higher pay level i am following that same policy with regard to the tax and outside earnings changes enacted last year and will not accept those increases until after the upcoming election i believe the entire congress can and should maintain this kind of policy i also believe that if the reasons for enacting a raise are legitimate members should not need to avoid going on record in support of such an increase finally i believe we cannot simply let last years actions standi believe the increase in the outside earnings limit should be postponed until the next congress in addition because it provides such a potentially huge windfall to members the elimination of the 3 000 limit on the tax deduction for members washington expenses should be rescinded entirely the ways and means committee should then reconsider the issue so that it can find a moderate level at which this limit can be setone that recognizes legitimate expenses but does not make members of congress a privileged class as the existing provision does therefore i have introduced several measures which i will now describe first a bill to prevent any salary increase from becoming effective until the seating of the congress following that in which the increase was approved the bill would also prevent a lameduck congress from enacting a pay increase for the following congress to prevent such an increase from becoming effective without any input from the voters second a resolution to prevent the house from voting members any salary increase any increase in outside earnings or any tax credit or deduction that applies to them as a distinct class without a separate rolleall vote on the issue third a bill to repeal the effect of the tax breaks congress voted itself last year fourth a resolution to delay until january 1 1983 the effective date of the increase in the outside earnings limitation for members of the house i am not someone who believes that there is no appropriate time for pay increases for members of congress this is a fulltime job and when it is done properly it is hard work but there are benefits and responsibilities that go along with this job that cannot be quantified but are more significant than any pay we might receive the benefit of having the ability to affect national policies to provide enormous help to people to contribute to the wellbeing of the nation and the world cannot be overestimated in addition the responsibility that comes along with that privilege and power means that we cannot abuse our mandatewe must remain accountable to our constituents therefore while we should not be afraid to raise our salaries when it is appropriate we should also remember that our jobs bring benefits no other american can share so those increases must be limited and we must remember to whom we are responsible and must be willing to tell our constituents that we feel a raise is merited and needed and that we are willing to go on record in support of such an increase only when the congress adopts a resonalie and honest policy with regard to pay increases will the american people truly be able to trust the motives and the instincts of the congress at this time in our history it is particularly important that we not create for ourselves additional benefits while we require others to sacrifice and it is particularly important that we not undermine any further the confidence of our constituents in elected officials i hope my colleagues

we all have gone beyond such dramatics i am here instead to remind you of certain facts in the past 10year period medicare expenditures have gone up from 9 billion to 47 billion a 430 percent increase or 43 percent a year medicaid expenditures have risen from 2 5 billion to 17 billion a 588 percent increase or 58 percent a year food stamps expenditures have risen from 2 billion to 11 2 billion a 580 percent increase or 58 percent a year afdc expenditures have gone up from 3 5 billion to 6 8 billion a 94 percent increase or 9 4 percent a year ssi expenditures have risen from 2 3 billion to 8 billion a 250 percent increase or 25 percent a year this is the basic reason why federal spending has soared out of control and why we are facing these massive deficits the poor the needy the elderly those who need help in our society cannot and will not be helped by policies whose maj6r assumptions are rooted in attitudes that have caused so much economic difficulty in the past congress has created a state within a state a 51st state a new state of poverty composed of poor and needy clients of the government forever dependent on the whims of congress we have to bring the poor and needy back to the american experience through longterm growth and prosperity anyone can shout compassion indeed many in this house have over the years made a career out of doing so but shouting compassion and then voting for inflation never created a single job it never lowered an interest rate it never brought one poor family into the economy i received a call from president reagan this morning from bonn west germany he told me of his full support of our substitute and he told me that his european counterparts with whom he has been dealing all week are very interested in what we do today moreover the american people want us to get with it today and are looking to us for leadership remember that word which has not been heard around here for so long leadership with all that it means in terms of foresight and yes courage to do the right thing let me say one final thing about a rumor that has been floating around here it says that if the latta substitute goes down the speaker and i will rush off to some secluded rendevous and put together a compromise i do not know where that myth started but it has about as much basis in reality as the loch ness monster or big foot there is little room or little time left now for compromise do not think there is a liferaft waiting for you if the bipartisan substitute goes down we all go down not just those of us in this house but millions of americans still waiting for us to act i am not going to review the torturous process by which we arrived at this point i will let historians trace the history of the gang of 17 the endless frustrating skull sessions in rooms all over the capitol and buildings all over town for 4 long months the hand of compromise has been extended for all of that time and it has been turned aside today is what matters right now is what matters either we do it right this time or else history and the american people will neverand should neverforgive us if i have any time left i want to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to those on the democratic side who have helped us fashion our bipartisan substitute these members within the last 2 weeks sat in on our deliberations with the socalled gypsy moths and yellow jackets and its was a learning process for all those members involved there was not a one who got his way everyone had to give some and take some and on my own side where there were some marked differences of opinion and shades of philosophy represented on the various issues i want to compliment my members for their cooperative spirit and their willingness to give and take all in the interest of putting together a winning combination that is the name of the game we feel we have put together a package here that will prevail that does credit to this house and more importantly will give the american people a measure of confidence that this institution can work for the good of the people when put to the ultimate test"], [0.0011470913887023926, 0.4988529086112976, 0,

"today the house of representatives has an opportunity to endorse legislation which will provide a firm basis for expanding unitedstates exports as the original house sponsor of export trading company legislation i have welcomed rapidly growing interest in the potential of this new opportunity and i have been gratified by the active support for trading company legislation over 130 of my colleagues have cosponsored my bill h r 1648 and i am sure they all share my enthusiastic support for h r 6016 the legislation we consider today when i first introduced my original bill during the 96th congress i was motivated in large part by concern about our deteriorating balance of trade unitedstates trade balances had been in deficit since 1975 with participating large deficits in 1977 and 1978 it seemed clear at that time that poor export performance was contributing july 2 7 1982 substantially to the deficits and that increased exports offered one of the more effective ways to remedy the problem those of us who looked closely at the structure of unitedstates trade and the structural impediments to increased exports were struck by the success of our competitors most notably the huge japanese trading companies operating in virtually every country in the world financed in part through strong ties to japanese banks and experienced in alternative trade mechanisms such as barter and threeway trading the japanese trading companies had grown enormously in fact they were becoming increasingly important as export agents for unitedstatesproduced goods from the beginning we used the japanese trading companies as a partial model for etc legislation but maintained careful attention to the different business and legal framework within which our own inst it utions must operate i reintroduced export trading company legislation during the early days of this congress with immediate bipartisan support it was clear that the need for stimulating exports had if anything increased the economic downturn had constricted domestic markets and a stronger dollar had made our exports more expensiveand thus less competitiveon world markets unfortunately those same forces remain today while it cannot fully compensate for them export trading legislation has become an important response to the pressures for new protectionist measures in this country the new administration accepted the need for export trading company legislation and endorsed my bill h r 1648 the senate moved swiftly on almost identical legislation s 734 and on april 8 1981 passed it unanimously by a vote of 93 to 0 in the house h r 1648 and similar bills had been referred to three separate committees and each proceeded independently but none could ignore the growing consensus both in congress and within the business community that export trading company legislation was an idea whose time had come our cause was bolstered by independent studies such as the one undertaken by the new england congressional institute it showed widespread support for the legislation within the business and banking communities and suggested that we would see immediate response to the new opportunities provided by the legislation other studies forecasted that the legislation might provide even more new jobs than originally anticipated an important consideration during this period of escalating unemployment growing awareness of the legislation was immediately translated into appeals for prompt congressional action on march 31 of this year the chairman of the house banking committee submitted his own proposal for the banking related elements of export trading company legislation i was among the original cosponsors of his bill h r 6016 the chairmans approach differed little from the banking title of my own bill and his bill included an additional export stimulus in a provision increasing the limits on bankers acceptances which provide a means of guaranteeing payment for goods being shipped during extensive hearings this spring the committee considered additional changes and refinements suggested by a broad crosssection of interested parties we heard from exporters potential exporters existing trading companies banks and bank regulators almost every witness suggested improvements designed to make the legislation more attractive to his own organization and it was left to the committee to sift through proposed changes in its final form h r 6016 represents careful study cooperation and compromise each element of the bill was subject to the same two tests will it make export trading companics more effective at meeting our export goals and will it be workable within the legal and regulatory structures of unitedstates banking the goal of this legislation has been clear from the beginning increasing exports during the hearings i restated my own conviction that export success not bank profits should be our objective certainly that will be the standard by which the legislation will be judged by a public eager for both the new jobs and the economic boost that exports can provide export trading companies have existed in this country for years but their growth and expansion have been severely limited by inadequate capital although several large corporations including sears and general electric have announced the formation of new trading company subsidiaries their impact at least initially will be limited formation of corporate sponsored etcs has given new impetus to our efforts to open the door to banking investments in trading companies but i doubt we will ever see an american replica of the japanese trading giants it would be too inconsistent with our own business and legal traditions i am convinced that bank investment in trading companies can contribute substantially by helping more unitedstates firms to become exporters in addition to new capital bank participation has the potential to improve the efficiency of trading company operations by making available the existing expertise and infrastructure possessed by large international banks contacts with potential customers familiarity with export financing and currency transactions and better means of evaluating the creditworthiness of foreign customers will all be facilitated by their worldwide networks of offices and affiliates because we felt that exploiting the recognition and goodwill associated with existing banking activities would stimulate exports the committee chose to permit holding companies to use their own names for trading company affiliates in other cases regional banks may choose to build upon their relationships with local business in order to encourage new export activities risk uncertainty and lack of familiarity with export procedures have all discouraged many small and medium sized firms from developing export markets but a wei3 run trading compa ny could substantially reduce those hurdles by linking with existing trading companies regional banks can provide the necessary expertise and financing to make exporting attractive to many more firms in addition because of their familiarity with the financial and management resources of local firms regional banks are uniquely equipped to help small companies meet the challenges of exportrelated growth in addressing the direct objective of increasing unitedstates exports ii r 6016 also represents an important step in the modernization of banking law authorization for bank investment in trading companies constitutes a significant relaxation of the historic legal separation of banking and commerce and the committee carefully reviewed the terms and conditions of such investments this legislation is designed to preserve necessary safeguards for the safety and soundness of our nations banking institutions while permitting bank holding companies to make better use of their substantial resources on a casebycase basis the committee relies on the substantial supervisory and regulatory resources of the federal reserve system to protect banks against the effects of unsound practices by their parent holding companies at the same time the committee also wished to insure that those resources not be applied to blocking legitimate investments a possibility introduced by the feds open scepticism about the legislation accordingly h r 6016 directs that the fed must be advised in writing at least 60 days in advance of a bank holding companys proposed investment in an etc and provides for an additional 30 days review period under defined circumstances absent a formal notice of disapproval from the fed the holding company is authorized to go ahead with the investment specific grounds for disapproval are outlined in the legislation and it was the committees intention that fed review be confined to legitimate questions of bank safety not unrelated activities of either the holding company or its other subsidiaries the legislation itself protects against excessive risk by limiting direct investment to 5 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus further loans from the holding company and all its other subsidiaries may not total more than 10 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus the bill approved by the banking committee defines export trading companies as organizations operated exclusively for the purpose of exporting or facilitating the export of goods and services made in the united stateo our choice of the word exclusively reflects a deliberate intention to focus the activities of etcs on exports rather than imports but h r 6016 clearly authorizes such importing activities as are necessary to facilitate exports and promote etc operations in foreign countries etcs are also authorized to make product modifications necessary to prepare unitedstates made goods for foreign markets and to take title to goods being exported an important element of trading company legislation is the explicit recognition of services as a distinct class of exports in fact a growing proportion of our export revenues comes from the services sector in its final form h r 6016 represents the culmination of a long evolutionary process a process marked by long discussion and careful study we have finetuned my original proposal and the resulting legislation will be an important stimulus to our economy thousands of unitedstates companies will now have access to a complete range of export assistance and many will find new prosperity in foreign markets my own involvement with this legislation has been very satisfying and i am pleased with the results of our efforts the banking committee can be proud of our success in drafting such excellent legislation i encourage the full house to support us

which i ask the houses favorable consideration underlying utah colorado and wyoming there are an estimated 1 8 trillion barrels of shale oil scattered throughout 17 000 square miles of land according to the department of interior overall 72 percent of unitedstates oil shale lands containing nearly 80 percent of the total quantity of shale oil is federally owned although only onethird of this resource is thought to be recoverable with known technology the recoverable reserves still equal about 90 percent of the known world reserves of conventional oil that is greater than the conventional oil reserves of the middle east and africa combined utah shares a good deal of this countrys potential for oil shale development along with colorado and wyoming yet because its occurrence is less rich geologically than in the piceance creek basin in colorado the constraints of the mineral leasing act of 1920 on tract size make oil shale development in utah economically infeasible oil shale deposits may represent the most economically and environmentally favorable alternative source to oil for gasoline supply in the long term yet under current economic and policy conditions shale oil production may only reach 20 000 to 65 000 barrels per day by 1987 instead of the favorable condition projection of 100 000 to 250 000 barrels per day by 1990 specifically the bill before the house would first expand the acreage limitation on oil shale leases by providing for lease expansion in lowquality shale areas the bills would promote greater development of shale oil in utah and wyoming where unlike the colorado shale the thickness of the resource zone and quality of the resource are generally not sufficient to make development of 5 120 acre tracts economical by providing true leasing opportunities in all three of the states of utah colorado and wyoming we can expand our knowledge of different shale technologies of the environmental impacts these different technologies have in each of the areas and can gain experience with the emerging shale industry under different conditions all of which were major objectives of the prototype oil shale leasing program second increase the number of lcases an entity is permitted to hold this provision would also help to promote development in utah and wyoming in addition granting additional leases would give benefits to those who have taken the initiative to develop a technology by allowing them the opportunity to apply that technology again otherwise if a company knows it will only be able to obtain one lease chances are they will only purchase an existing technology instead of experimenting if we want innovation and development of a wide range of technologies we should offer industry incentive to do so the provision for the granting of an additional lease would further this objective third allow the leasing of fringe acreage to avoid bypass of oil shale deposits during mining it is commonsense to have a provision whereby small tracts that would not be economically viable to mine separately may be leased and not included in the ceiling on lease ownership in those cases efficiency rather than the exact number of leases is the major concern fourth allow leasing of minerals other than oil shale within an oil shale lease tract the secretary of the interior should be allowed to issue leases for multimineral development of resources found along with oil shale this would clear up any question of the secretarys authority to do what practical economics would dictate assuring full utilization of natural resources on leased hund the general accounting office in its january 1981 report on possible ways to streamline existing federal energy minerals leasing rules agrued that any oil shale leasing legislatlion should contain such a provision fifth allow the leasing of additional nonshale lands for operations connected with oil shale mining it only makes sense to not preclude the mining of lands containing oil shale by covering them with spent shale or operation facilities furthermore as reported by the gao projected costs for developing an oil shale industry will be very high and industry will need some economics of scale to make the venture attractive under this legislation the lessee would have to demonstrate that an additional tract is necessary and appropriate for its operation the legislation would also require that the fair market value be paid for any lease to be used for offtract disposal testimony received by the subcommittee in vernal utah indicated the need for these provisions if projects of a meaningful size are to be initiated and sustained this country has no greater need than to reduce its dependence on imported oil utah is fortunate to contain many renewable and

thereafter the requirements would be set by the secretary of transportation between 33 and 50 peri cent fifty percent is the last year requirement of the ottinger bill the secretary of transportation would make a determination whether it is more appropriate to have it be 33 or 50 percent because of the peculiar nature of the situation if we want to protect jobs for amercan autoworkersand i believe every member of this house wants totelling honda to pack it bags and build its cars elsewhere because it cannot meet the requirements put in the bill as it is now written is not the way to do that i

marysville ohio its accord model one of several models that are sold in this country if all of your models are made in this country then obviously the legislation is applicable but when only one model is made here that model must be mixed in with those models which come from elsewhere and that means that honda cannot meet the standards that are set even though their investment in ohio for all production is 250 millionmore than they have invested in 20 years aggregate anyplace else outside of japan it seems to me that that investment and the suppliers that have moved in to make things in the united states that go into that accord automobile indicate a clear decision on the part of the most independent of the japanese automobile manufacturers to build in america to build part of their model line here and hopefully in the future years other parts of their model line but the accord is the highest priced automobile in their line if you will it is comparable to the cadillac or the
