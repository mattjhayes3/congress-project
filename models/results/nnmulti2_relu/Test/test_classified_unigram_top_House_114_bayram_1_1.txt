majority have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities which include the passage of a budget resolution in fact it was thencongressman ryan who in 2012 stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for american families there are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in america and throughout the world but republicans have abdicated their responsibility the zika virus the flint water crisis and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities in suburban america and all throughout the rural parts of this country yet house republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible members of congress should be doing at this particular point in time i am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished gentlewoman from the great lone star state who has always been thoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her district which is anchored in houston texas but through her membership and leadership on the homeland security committee as well as on the house judiciary committee she has been so thoughtful and effective on a great many

prevention task force and in solidarity with the majority of americans who are demanding that congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence we all know the statistics whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our colleagues how much longer must we wait how many more people have to die to move us to act how many more american towns and cities must be added to the constantly growing list of places like orlando and columbine and aurora and charleston and newtown moments of silence arent enough thoughts and prayers are not enough in fact the scriptures teach us that such pieties give grave offense when they mask a refusal to do what we know is right we need action i call

by a sniper in dallas while they were on duty we saw very troubling videos of philando castile and alton sterling being shot today we also mark the 1month anniversary of the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando a hateful act on the lgbt community that took the lives of 49 people this shooting shook the country as have the many mass shootings that have preceded it as we still process these deaths daily violence continues in communities around the country over the weekend the total number of shootings in chicago where i come from this year exceeded 2 100 over 300 people in chicago have now died from gun violence in 2016 i have received hundreds and hundreds of letters from constituents of all ages concerned about the effect of gun violence in our communities and in their communities yesterday i received a letter from a young constituent an 8yearold named kaline she wrote i read the suntimes every day like my dad i read and still think about the story of tyshawn lee its just hitting my mind all the time because its not fair it makes me cry tyshawn lee was a 9yearold boy in chicago deliberately assassinated shot multiple times in the head kaline continues i hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns i hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because i worry more people and kids like tyshawn will be killed we cant accept violence as normal this is not the country kaline should have to grow up in and how do you explain to an 8year old that in america with 91 people dying from gun violence every single day we have taken no meaningful action we take action all the time to protect our kids from threats to their safety we have regulations in place on teddy bears and pacifiers to protect childrens health and safety but nothing for guns guns are specifically exempted from regulation by the consumer product safety commission the agency charged with protecting consumers from unreasonable risk or injury or death gun manufacturers are protected from liability for damage caused by their weapons the centers for disease control is actually prohibited in law from studying the public health risk of guns robert a 91yearold and a veteran of world war ii from my district wrote you know better than i do the vast array of efforts to protect the american people from the recklessness and avarice in the marketplace yet congress has failed the people in the matter of gun control today the american public is crying for laws he says robert is right i can think of no other product or industry that has so few measures in place to protect our safety and we need to rethink our approach to guns we cant put the interests of gun manufacturers and the gun lobby ahead of the safety of our communities those of us in congress have the power to do something and it is long past time for us to act we can start with measures that have broad support among the american people ninety percent of americans support comprehensive background checks background checks would help reduce the flood of weapons that come into chicago from gun shows and online sales would it stop every shooting of course it wouldnt but would it save some lives absolutely my heart goes out to the families in dallas and orlando and chicago and so many other places that have had the lives of their loved ones stolen away by gun violence and we need to grieve but after that moment of silence we must direct our sadness and our anger into action the problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable and no single policy will stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands

congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality

are profound points excellent points she has been making about the socalled iran deal what is shocking to meand i got this copy that a friend was using but the pages arent numbered by the way when secretary kerry came to the hill todayin having been through briefings by our secretary previouslyi knew that the best use of my time would be in going and reading the deal for myself which is what i did it was interesting i know that we have been assured over and over publicly that this is such a great deal that this is what is going to really save the world from the iranians having a nuclear deal but there are some very troubling things that i havent heard anybody mention about this agreement actually there is a report that there is an outside deal that has to be arranged by the iaea with iran in order to have a complete deal which is that the iaea is going to have to work out termsconditionsof its examination of some of the nuclear facilities in iran that is deeply troubling here is a story by joel gehrke from july 21 entitled house republican obama administration wont release full iran deal to congress it reads senator tom cotton and representative mike pompeo who serves on the house intelligence committee learned of the arrangement while meeting with the iaea in vienna austria last week that we are only now discovering that parts of this dangerous agreement are being kept secret begs the question of what other elements may also be secret and entirely free from public scrutiny meeting with the iaea is something that i have done in the last year and a half but because of the ban by our speaker on my being able to travel because i was hoping to have a different speaker i am not able to visit anymore in a room with the iaea in their office in vienna that was immensely helpful to do in the job as one of the speakers folks mentioned they see taxpayerfunded travel as a reward and i havent earned their giving away taxpayerfunded travel apparently that is something you earn by voting like you are told to in any event i am glad that mike pompeo and senator tom cotton have been over there and have met with them there is just so much about this deal that stinks to high heaven especially when you see it today in that apparently in the last year or so there must have been approval for an exception to the sanctions on iran to allow iran to have 13 metric tons of pure gold shipped to it from south africa then we find out today that actually the unitedstates was releasing 4 2 billion to iran apparently in return paying them to sit down and negotiate further i will tell you that our allies have got to be really miffed as they find out more and more about the way this administration operates if you are our friend we are going to cut deals with your enemy that create a real issue as to whether or not you may exist in the future but if you are our enemy we will pay you just to sit down and negotiate with us we will allow you to get gold shipped to you from 13 metric tons there is no telling how much grief those 13 metric tons of gold have cost the unitedstates i wonder how many american lives have had their demise contributed to because of the gold how many jews or christians around the world have lost their lives as a result of this administrations paying the worlds leading sponsor of terror all of this money apparently just to sit down with them and releasing all of this money in the past just to get them to come to the table we dont do that with our friends we dont pay them to sit down with us we have already seen this in the attempted dealings with the taliban it has not been that many years ago it has been since i have been in congress that this administration was reaching out to the taliban which has killed so many americans and continues to kill americans in fact under commander in chief george w bush we losti believe it wasabout 560 precious military american lives in afghanistan in that entire 71 2 yearsabout 71 4 years actually this president has only been in office 61 2 years and under his commandhis rules of engagement that cripple our militarys ability to defend themselvesunder this administration and this commander in chiefs rules there have been over three times that many lost american precious military lives with this president being in command of three times the number of lost american military lives in afghanistan this administrations approach couldnt learn anything from the bush administrations mistakes and successes instead it decided to reach out there are all kinds of reports of their reaching out their offers look taliban if you will just sit downno preconditions if you will just agree to sit down with us we will be releasing murderers you want released from guantanamo or anywhere else not only that we will buy you luxurious offices in qataror wherever you sayjust to sit down with us our enemies have really learned how to deal with this administration our friends have got to be scratching their heads those who still have their heads therein lies another tragedy in this agreement until i can be sure that the parts i read have been released publiclyand that is why i was asking for this copy of the agreement it is a different format from what i was reading earlier today as a judge as a chief justice even as a lawyer who has taken on the worlds largest oil companyi did years ago successfullyand as a lawyer who has taken on some pretty unbelievable efforts words mean a lot when i am reading through things there is one word that particularly catches my attention and that is the little twoletter disjunctive word or until i can be sure that what i had read has been releasedit should be there is no reason that this agreement should not be public so everyone can read it to those folks out there who are saying hey it is a 10year deal it will keep iran from having nuclear weapons for 10 years even though it may come back and have a nuclear weapon within a month 2 months 3 months after the 10 years at least it will keep them tied up for 10 years i would encourage anybody who has access to the actual agreement to look at any years mentioned8 10 whatever it isand then see if there is that little twoletter disjunctive word or and then see if there is a provision for a shorter time than 10 years or a shorter time than 8 years to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles these are things i have seen publicly but i think it is critical what kind of time or length of time of this deal are we looking at if there is this disjunctive little word or anywhere after any time that this deal will last we need to know how long that other provision might be that would be shorter than 10 years if that provision if such exists puts the hands of how long this deal will last completely out of the united states hands completely out of the p5 1 then that alone makes this deal a no deal it is outrageous that anything but a hard timeline could exist in such a deal there is a story from july 16 by james jay carafano the first paragraph reads once a major diplomatic agreement is inked the world typically reacts by holding its breath waiting to see if it will all turn out all right some deals like the munich pact crumble quickly others like the camp david accords hang in there but rarely has there been a deal like the one reached in vienna last nighta deal in which all the nations most closely affected by it including iran pretty much start out knowing it wont end well here i would like to point out that as absolutely atrocious as the clintonalbrightwendy sherman deal with north korea was at least south korea and japan were involved and present for the talks because our allies japan and south korea were the ones most affected by any deal that the united states cut with north korea now it was an outrageous agreement i mean i was just a district judge at the time but i knew clearly from history and from current events that it was a deal that said here north korea we will help you build nuclear reactors which will give you nuclear material to make sure you have got what you need all we ask in return basically is that you promise that you will never use any of this stuff to create nuclear weapons of course north korea jumped on that dealdifferent from here though the number one most affected country by this deal is our dear friend israel well this president and all his minions could not get prime minister netanyahu defeated and out of office as they tried to do this administration has tried to punish israel different ways and those in the administration who really do want to punish israel that dont like israel they have got to be smiling over this deal because it is absolutely unconscionable what has been done in the deal as it affects the future of israel it is just incredible that we could allow this then saudi arabia right there in the vicinity they certainly understand what a bad deal this is as we understand it they are already making clear they are going to have to have a nuclear weapon egypt is going to need a nuclear weapon this deal makes clear that iran is going to have nuclear weapons in at least 10 years 10 years 2 months whatever anybody wants to say or out of my concern possibly much sooner than that legally under the deal even if it were ratified by the senate this is of tremendous concern this is what the entire world except for the most evil perpetrators in it has worried most about a point in world history where there is massive proliferation of nuclear weapons it wont do much good to return a nobel peace prize after a president causes nuclear proliferation that leads ultimately to the loss of millions of lives and rampant destruction around the world and certainly in the middle east we have got all these folks worried about climate change and here we are on the brink of 10 years at the most before the most terroristic evil nationwell the nation is not evil their leaders arethe most evil leaders in the world have their hands on nuclear weapons that will kill millions of people it wont do much good for all those who lose their lives in a horrible flash if the president sends back his nobel peace prize as being the cause of that that is why it is so important that we stop this deal i dont have any belief at all that anybody in this administration wants the world to go up after nuclear proliferation in one big mushroom cloud i dont believe that i know that is not true but that is what their actionsif not stopped by senators and house members that is what is going to happen this is not just me saying so dr carafano says the whole neighborhood will race to go nuclear the number one concern with the way this deal was structured was that it was bound to accelerate nuclear proliferation iran has violated its obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and repeatedly thumbed its nose at oversight from the international atomic energy agency the iaea yet it winds up getting a great deal under the agreementbetter in fact than the deal the united states gives its friends and allies through the 123 civil nuclear agreements if regional powers like turkey egypt and saudi arabia believe that the likelihood of iran getting a weapon is undiminished and the penalty for becoming a nuclear breakout power is plummeting then the deterrent for them to cross the nuclear threshold drops as well tehran gets to keep its vast nuclear infrastructure and its missile program it goes on to talk about that sanctions relief will make the region far less safe the deal is temporary by design i tell you we hear from our friends in the unitedstates chamber of commerce our local chambers of commerce at least about how normally to calculate economic impact of 1 being spent somewhere you have to multiply it times seven because that dollar gets spent again and spent again and spent again i would submit that with this deal with iran the most evil leaders in the world the 100 billion to 150 billion that this administration makes sure they have cant just be limited by 100 billion to 150 billion when it comes to the calculation of evil that will result from that money we can be sure that since iran sponsors terrorism around the world that it will spend a lot of that money creating terrorism with other terrorists and with other evil people and those evil people will then be able to take the billions of dollars they get from iran and spend that for their evil purposes with other evil people you may be looking at really a trillion dollars by the time all of that money gets spent when you look at it as chambers of commerce normally do the potential for evil for the 100 billion to 150 billion going to an unrepentant sponsor of world terrorism is really dramatic it is just incredible that this is happening on anybodys watch republican democrat it doesnt matter it is incredible here is an article by sarah wheaton july 21st in both a muscular speech to the veterans of foreign wars in pittsburgh and a taping of the daily show with jon stewart obama cast critics of his diplomacy as the same kind of misguided warmongers who pushed for the invasion of iraq during george w bushs presidency i guess that includes hillary clinton john kerry i think he may have been on board with that the article says were hearing the echoes of some of those same policies and mindset that failed us in the past obama said in pittsburgh his loudest critics he added are the same folks who were so quick to go to war in iraq and said it would take a few months well it is interesting to me that our president reserves making his case for the iran deal for a venue such as comedy central and it really would be a comedic escapade if this werent so serious and we werent talking about the existence of israel the continued lives or stoppage of lives of christians and jews around the world we know what the leaders of iran think they never ever stop saying what they think it is just incredible they have never stopped demanding death to america and death to israel i see this article by raf sanchez from july 21st the unitedstates said on tuesday it was disturbed by an outburst of antiamerican rhetoric from irans supreme leader in the wake of the nuclear deal as fierce debates over the agreement began in both the iranian parliament and unitedstates congress john kerry the unitedstates secretary of state said he was troubled by a fiery speech in which ayatollah khamenei promised to continue fomenting unrest across the middle east and said irans policy towards the arrogant unitedstates will not change if it is the policy its very disturbing its very troubling and well have to wait and see no we shouldnt have to wait and see when irans evil leaders say they are going to keep fomenting trouble they are going to keep killing christians and jews across the middle east they are going to keep killing moderate muslims in the middle east we should not wait we should take them seriously they are saying it while the deal is still not affirmed and ratified here in the united states you would have to be a blooming idiot to make a deal with people who are saying they are going to take the money they get from this deal and kill americans kill christians kill jews and give them the money anyway there are going to be consequences for this kind of irresponsibility i would just encourage anyone who has access to an updated copy of the iran deal look to see for sure if it is limited to a 10year deal or perhaps could somebody do an inspection and say oh it is all goodmaybe it is a 5year deal instead of a 10year deal when the person making the agreement has no power after the deal is signed sealed and delivered over when that deal ends it is not a deal that should be made that alone ought to be enough to make anyone walk away from it i am immensely concerned for our friends around the world i have mentioned numerous timesand i keep going back to the words of a west african named ebeneezer a senior citizen there in west africa who explained how excited they were when we elected our first black president but they have seen america get weaker and he begged me to tell people in washington that when we get weaker in america they suffer more around the world and specifically in africa those words still bother me this deal with an evil group of leaders in iran is going to spell death down the road for masses of people if we dont get it stopped that is my plea lets stop the deal for the good of the world i

consideration of h r 1155 the searching for and cutting regulations that are unnecessarily burdensome act of 2016 or the scrub act this is a bipartisan measure that provides a fair and reasonable way to find and repeal outdated and inefficient regulations that are still on the books it doesnt target any particular type of regulation or industry but it prioritizes older expensive rules that are ripe for improvement or may no longer be necessary the needs of our economy small businesses and american families arent the same today as they were 15 or 20 years ago thus we should ensure that the rules governing the way we live and work reflect what is best for our country today not what agencies thought best decades ago i thank my colleague from missouri for introducing this bipartisan solution and his staff for their hard work on this measure if you put a piece of paper in the hand of every single person who lives in my hometown of gainesville georgia it still wouldnt equal the number of pages in the 2015 federal register in fact it comes in at a recordsetting 82 036 pages that means there were over 82 000 pages of new rules and regulations proposed just last year the code of federal regulations is 235 volumes long containing 175 000 pages of federal regulations knowing this it should come as no surprise that federal regulations impose an estimated burden of 1 86 trillion that is roughly 15 000 per unitedstates household and is higher than combined individual and corporate federal income taxes it is difficult to imagine a scenario where there is nothing in those thousands upon thousands of pages that cant be improved streamlined or retired unfortunately american businesses and families bear the burden of compliance even when a regulation is outdated

the judiciary committee and are brought to the floor as reported by the committee americas small businesses and job creators need relief from the flood of new regulations and red tape from washington small business owners often cite government regulations as the single most important problem they face today a heavy contributor to the burden of new regulation is the use of consent decrees and settlement agreements to bind federal agencies to issue new rules regulators often cooperate with proregulatory organizations to advance their mutual agendas in this way the device agencies use is simple an organization that wants new regulations alleges that an agency has violated a duty to declare new rules the agency and the plaintiff work out a deal under the cover of litigation the deal puts the agency under judicially backed deadlines to issue the rules these deadlines often give the public little opportunity to comment on proposed rules and the white house limited ability to review them deals can even require agencies to propose specific regulatory language negotiated by the agency and its regulationfriendly plaintiff those who will be regulated by the new deal typically do not know about these deals until the plaintiffs complaints and the proposed decrees or settlements are filed in court by then it is too late frankly it is just also unfair regulated businesses and individuals are unlikely to be able to intervene in the litigation the court usually approves the deals before regulated parties have an opportunity to affect whether new regulatory costs will be imposed upon them these regulated parties could be families small businesses farmers ranchers or even local governments i introduced h r 712 to restore transparency public participation and judicial review protections to shine a light on one of the worst regulatory abuses in our system today these sue and settle agreements the sunshine for regulatory consent decrees and settlements act of 2015 puts an end to the abuse of this practice and ensures that those to be regulated have a fair opportunity to participate in the resolution of litigation that affects them the bill respects the basic rights of plaintiffs and defendants to manage litigation between them as a result the bill offers an effective and balanced remedy we must ensure more transparency and scrutiny of consent decrees and settlement agreements that require new regulations these commonsense reforms are needed to help control the tide of excessive and costly rules it is time we get rid of the welcome mat outside the door of regulatory agencies for these suits under which they can more easily issue expensive and controversial new regulationspolicies that oftentimes could never pass congressclaiming that the court made me do it again bypassing our constitutional system it is not a good idea h r 712 addresses the weaknesses in the current system while preserving consent decrees as an important mechanism for settling legal disputes it accomplishes this by increasing participation of affected regulated entities and coregulators in the negotiation in the consideration of decrees and settlements the ability of citizens to hold government accountable is an important part of administrative law but it must be appropriately carried out with transparency and full public participation importantly h r 712 puts an end to a practice that uses taxpayer dollars to allow special interests to abuse the system and force regulators to put out even more regulations title ii of h r 712 the alert act continues our work to relieve the regulatory burden on american families by requiring agencies to publicly provide information on planned regulations estimated compliance costs and other updates so that those impacted by the new regulations have the information they need to make financial decisions and plan for the future title iii of h r 712 the providing accountability through transparency act is another good governing measure that demonstrates this bodys commitment to making life better for all americans it requires agencies to publish a brief summary of each proposed regulation online and in plain language agencies do not have the right to conduct their business behind closed doors and hide behind an overly complex regulatory system every regulation impacts every american directly or indirectly and agencies should be held accountable for the regulations they produce and how they communicate the new requirements to those who will be forced to abide by them the rules committee met yesterday evening on these measures and heard testimony from the chairman and ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform the chairman of oversight and government reform and the government operations subcommittee ranking member this combined rule makes every amendment submitted to the rules committee in order seven amendments to h r 712 will be debated on the house floor and 11 amendments to h r 1155 will be considered for h r 712 the rule provides 1 hour of general debate with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on oversight and government reform for h r 1155 this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the committee on the judiciary and committee on oversight and government reform this rule and the underlying legislation represents regular order at its finest i am proud to see the leadership of chairman sessions and speaker ryan are reflected in this robust and open process i

have worked with us let me remind my colleagues that just a few days ago i offered this amendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the funding and the smithsonian to provide for the nations museum let me also say to my colleagues that i have offered this amendment in the past because i have a particular interest in the museums of america and their ability to do outreach i imagine i am not alone standing here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end of sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide the people of america the full funding to address these quality of life issues from the various lands and federal parks and as well the historic trails of which i will talk about but museums urban reforestation all elements of the beauty of this nation and i frankly believe that museums likewise are that form of beauty my amendment specifically says none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the nation are in trouble the smithsonian has a beautiful array of museums that are here that millions of americans have the opportunity to visit but the outreach program serves millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and web sites allow me to mention just a few in my own district the holocaust museum unique in its presentation of a horrible time in history but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it needs the impact of the outreach of the smithsonian and then of course the museum of african american culture headed by a dear friend but also a champion of holding this museum together and that is john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals specifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that really need the help of the smithsonian the smithsonian in concluding is very important to urban areas and rural areas alike and its ability or its affiliation is to build a strong national network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the country again allow me to salute in particular john guess with the museum of african american culture in houston he has literally put that museum together along with his board members the smithsoniani hope they are hearing me as i am talking on the floor of the housewe need your help in houston texas we probably need your help in washington state in california minnesota new york and beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the nation i ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment but the museums of this nation and i say to mr calvert we had discussed this before this amendment now is a placeholder hopefully for our discussion going forward dealing with the preservation of our museums let me thank mr calvert mr simpson and ms mccollum i yield back the balance of my time mr chair thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to h r 2822 the interior and environment appropriations act of 2016 let me also thank chairman calvert and ranking member mccollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor among other agencies this legislation funds the smithsonian institution which operates our national museums including the air and space museum the museum of african art the museum of the american indian and the national portrait gallery the smithsonian also operates another national treasure the national zoo mr chair my amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the congress of the united states the jackson lee amendment simply provides that sec none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution this amendment is identical to an amendment i offered to the interior and environment appropriations act for fy2008 that was approved by voice vote on june 26 mr chair the smithsonians outreach programs bring smithsonian scholars in art history and science out of the nations attic and into their own backyard each year millions of americans visit the smithsonian in washington d c but in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history offered by the smithsonian the smithsonians outreach programs serve millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and websites smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with smithsonian museums and research centers as well as with 144 affiliate institutions and others across the nation the smithsonians outreach activities support communitybased cultural and educational organizations around the country they ensure a vital recurring and highimpact smithsonian

african american asian american latino native american and new american and provide kindergarten through collegeage museum education and outreach opportunities these outreach programs enhance k12 science education programs facilitate the smithsonians scholarly interactions with students and scholars at universities museums and other research institutions and disseminate results related to the

smithsonian across america a celebration of national pride this mobile museum which will feature smithsonian artifacts from the most iconic presidential portraits historical american flags civil war records astronaut uniforms etc to the simplest items of everday life family quilts prairie schoolhouse furnishings historical lunch boxes multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million but also advance a key smithsonian performance objective to develop exhibit approaches that address diverse audiences including population groups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions sites also will be the public exhibitions face of the smithsonians national museum of african american history and culture as that new museum comes online providing national access to projects that will introduce the american

friend from texas a former judge down in houston talk about love i do love him as a christian brother we can disagree and still love each other i have been surprised in recent years to find some of those of us who believe in the book that used to be read here it was a pretty common practice on the floor of the house on sundays down in statuary hall and even in this room back when church services were held in the former house chamber it was attended by the man that first coined the phrase separation of church and state it is not in the constitution it was in his letter to the danbury baptists he came to a nondenominational christian worship service down the hall of course thomas jefferson would even bring the marine band and have them play hymns because although he made clear he believed in separation of church and state and used that phrase he didnt see any problem with singing hymns and having the marine band play the hymns to accompany right here in the unitedstates capitol i have been surprised in recent years at how prominent the bible was in our founding so much so that toward the end of june 1787 the constitutional convention was at wits end having a great deal of trouble and randolph from virginia made a motion that they all convene together on the nations birthday and worship god together in services under the auspices of the bible they came back and were able to reach a conclusion that we call the constitution people like alexander hamilton said that clearly the finger of god was in that and it all came into place after they worshipped the lord and used the bible in worship there in but it is amazing now after the bible was such a prominent part of our founding throughout our history now those of us that believe what is in the bible are the ones who are now discriminated against i have suffered it right here in this town not to the extent of being harmed physically of course physical threats are not uncommon but they were there when i was a judge as well so i am just going to read without comment the book that has been read in this capitol throughout our history romans 1 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of god for salvation to everyone who believes to the jew first and also to the greek for in the righteousness of god is revealed from faith for faith as it is written the righteous shall live by faith for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppressed the truth and unrighteousness because that which is known about god is evident within them for god made it evident to them for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse for even though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible god for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds fourfooted animals crawling creatures therefore god gave them over in the lust of their hearts to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire for one another men with men committing indecent acts because i believe the scripturelove those who dont love those because we have all sinned one way or anotherthere is no room to hate anybody that has sinned because we all have we have all fallen short but i am sure my office will be getting nasty angry bitter calls as we often do when we refer to the bible that helped give us our founding but that is what the bible said and i am deeply concerned that we have supreme court justices two of whom who have actually participated in samesex weddings thereby showing how biased and partial they are in favor of such things against the dignity and history of marriage in the country marriage in the bible it has been said many times here over our history moses said it came from god that moses depicted right up above the center door that a man shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and the two will become one flesh when jesus was asked about marriage he repeated it for a man shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and the two will become one flesh and jesus added what god has joined together let no man put asunder so we have two justices that have already indicated they believe otherwise than the law of moses and jesus and they have shown themselves to be anything but impartial so under the law 28 united states code 455 it is mandatory they shall disqualify themselves and if it turns out that they sit in judgment on a case in which they are clearly disqualified and a part of the majority that cannot possibly be a legitimate law change judges substituting their law for the law that this country has utilized throughout its history yes courts all over the country have substituted their judgment for state constitutions and laws and for those who dont believe the bible you have got nothing to worry about but the indications are in romans 1 gods protective hand will be withdrawn when we continue to abandon the nations founding thank god churches fought for so many were involved in the movement to make the constitution mean just what it said we really shouldnt have had to have a 14th amendment everybody should have been equal under the law but it took an amendment took a civil rights movement to apply it across the board now we have judges that will be oligarchs as they have been and they will be making decisions rather than elected officials and we will see how much longer the nation lasts there is no hate just a broken heart in me but i will be accused of being hatemonger this hatemonger that that is not the case i would like to congratulate our own leadership this is the hill obama poised for huge win on trade i would like to congratulate our speaker our republican leadership for pushing through the trade deal leader mcconnell down the hall the president could not have gotten this ability to fasttrack to make deals that we wont know about without the republican leadership making that happen for him of course nobody that i know of on the republican side ran promising that we would get such ability for president obama but congratulations go there some people say i am not quick enough to congratulate my own republican leadership i mean i have congratulated our speaker before when he was chairman of the education committee as president bush cited in his book our nowspeaker was very important very instrumental in getting no child left behind pushed through of course when we won the majority in november 2010 got it back that december deals were worked out that cost the country a lot of spending raised the debt a great deal since then although we continue to promise that we are going to do something about the debt we continue to give the president almost a blank check but congratulations on all these congratulations on enabling the president to make these kind of deals then we will see if this law tpa is finally one the president abides by and gives us notice timely as he hasnt done in so many other areas like guantanamo and releasing people from guantanamo but we have an article here i guess congratulations then would go to the commanderinchief because i dont know that this would be the lion lying down with the lamb if this lamb is the iranian militarybacked forces but this article from bloomberg june 22 josh rogin and eli lake says the unitedstates military and iranianbacked shiite militias are getting closer and closer in iraq even sharing a base while iran uses those militias to expand its influence in iraq and fight alongside the bashar alassad regime in neighboring syria two senior administration officials confirmed to us the unitedstates soldiers and shiite militia groups are both using the taqaddum military base in anbar the same iraqi base where president obama is sending an additional 450 unitedstates military personnel to help train the local forces fighting against the islamic state some of the iranbacked shiite militias at the base have killed american soldiers in the past some inside the obama administration fear that sharing the base puts unitedstates soldiers at risk the unitedstates intelligence community has reported back to washington that representatives of some of the more extreme militias have been spying on unitedstates operations at taqaddum one senior administration official told us that could be calamitous if the fragile relationship between the unitedstates military and the shiite militia comes apart and iranbacked forces decide to again target unitedstates troops american critics of this growing cooperation between the unitedstates military and the iranianbacked militias call it a betrayal of the unitedstates personnel who fought against the militias during the 10year unitedstates occupation of iraq its an insult to the families of the american soldiers that were wounded and killed in battles in which the shia militias were the enemy senate armed services chairman john mccain told us now providing arms to them and supporting them its very hard for those families to understand the unitedstates is not directly training shiite units of what are known as the popular mobilization forces which include tens of thousands of iraqis who have volunteered to fight against the islamic state as well as thousands of hardened militants who ultimately answer to militia leaders loyal to tehran but the unitedstates is flying close air support missions for those forces the unitedstates gives weapons directly only to the iraqi government and the iraqi security forces but the lines between them and the militias are blurry unitedstates weapons often fall into the hands of militias like iraqi hezbollah sometimes the military cooperation is even more explicit commanders of some of the hardline militias sit in on unitedstates military briefings on operations that were meant for the government controlled iraqi security forces a senior administration official said this collaboration with terrorist groups that have killed americans was seen as unavoidable as the unitedstates marshaled iraqis against the islamic state but could prove counterproductive to unitedstates interests in the long term this official said the militias comprise largely shiite volunteers and are headed by the leader of the iraqi hezbollah abu mahdi almuhandis he was sanctioned in 2009 by the treasury department for destabilizing iraq almuhandis is a close associate of qasem suleimani the iranian quds force commander who has snapped selfies with the militia leader at key battles other militias that have participated in the fighting against the islamic state include the league of the righteous which in 2007 carried out a brutal roadside execution of five unitedstates soldiers near karbala the group to this day boasts of its killing of unitedstates soldiers in an interview in february a spokesman for the militia defended the killings and said his militia had killed many more american soldiers members of these groups have also been deployed by iran to defend the assad regime in neighboring syria james clapper the director of national intelligence confirmed in a june 3 letter to seven republican senators which we obtained that iran and hezbollah have also leveraged allied iraqi shia militant and terrorist groups which receive training in iran to participate in the proassad operations the militias also stand accused of gross human rights abuses and battlefield atrocities in sunni areas where they have fought the state department heavily criticized irans support for the iraqi militias and those militias behavior in its annual report on worldwide terrorism released last week further down with the deadline approaching for a nuclear deal that would place up to 150 billion in the hands of iran the unitedstates is now openly acknowledging in its annual report on international terrorism that iran is supporting a foreign legion comprising afghans iraqis and lebanese fighters to defend iranian interests throughout the middle east but the unitedstates response to this is inconsistent in iraq america is fighting alongside iranianbacked militias in syria unitedstatessupported forces are fighting against those same militias the tragedy of this policy is that the islamic state has been able to hold and expand its territory in iraq and syria while iran has been able to tighten its grip on baghdad then another article from daniel horowitz conservative review anyone who visits walter reed hospital will immediately see the irrevocable destruction of hezbollah thousands of our troops have been incapacitated and mangled by ieds from hezbollah and other shiite groups in iraq all funded by obamas ally iran anyone who was around in 1983 will remember the 241 american servicemen who were killed in the hezbollah terror attack in beirut guess what obama is doing with them eli lake reports at bloomberg news that our troops are sharing a base with hezbollahcontrolled shiite forces and we are bailing them out of their humiliating loss to the islamic state 1945 the article goes on but it is just exceedingly tragic but it explains why the president has been unable to state that we have a clear strategy in the middle east because on the one hand we have had the united states military give their lives fighting against the tyranny and the atrocities of hezbollah on the other hand we now have the president the commander in chief who commands over our forces that he has put in the same camp with hezbollah the hope apparently of the administration is even though they are still bragging in hezbollah about killing american soldiers that maybe by having them camp in the same camp they wont be killing them now you have got to love that optimism as we see the commander in chiefs troops being forced to come together with people like hezbollahthat want to kill them have killed them have maimed them hezbollah is clearly supported by iranthen we get this ap exclusive document outlines bigpower nuke help to iran george jahn dated today from vienna the united states and other nations negotiating a nuclear deal with iran are ready to offer hightech reactors and other stateoftheart equipment to tehran if it agrees to crimp programs that can make atomic bombs according to a confidential document obtained tuesday by the associated press the draft document one of several technical appendixes meant to accompany the main text of any deal has dozens of bracketed texts where disagreements remain technical cooperation is the least controversial issue at the talks and the number of brackets suggest the sides have a ways to go not only on the topic but also more contentious disputes with little more than a week until the june 30 deadline for a deal with that deadline looming irans top leader ayatollah ali khamenei on tuesday rejected a longterm freeze on nuclear research and supported banning international inspectors from accessing military sites khamenei in comments broadcast on iranian state television also said iran will sign a final deal provided all economic sanctions now in iran are first lifted in a sign the islamic republic may be toughening its stance ahead of the deadline in any event that is great news of course the senate and house passed a bill that turned requirements for authorization of treaties upside down instead of having twothirds of the senate required to approve a deal we have flipped it now it will take twothirds of a vote in the house and senate to disapprove a deal that makes it easier for the president to give iran the nuclear reactors they are hoping i brought this up in past years but here in negotiating with iran one of our lead negotiators was the same person who was involved in the clinton administration negotiations with north korea where they cut this wonderful deal basically saying in essence we will give you nuclear reactors for power if you will just promise that you wont use them to make nuclear weapons this dishonest evil leader said all you want is a promise from a dishonest leader that i wont use them to make nukes sure i will promise you that bring on the nuclear power plants those came and they were converted now north korea is helping with parts of the evil empire to develop nuclear weapons of their own when you have somebody involved in that kind of deal with north korea sent to negotiate with iran we should have known that this would be coming hey we will give you nuclear reactors we will help you make it happen we just dont want you to use them to make nuclear weapons since iran has beenat least the leaders have been so evil in the way they have pursued israel in the way they have pursued americans continuing to brag about killing americans i dont think anybody should really be surprised if this deal gets cut and then iran goes ahead and uses what we provide them or the p5 1 provides them in order to make nuclear weapons more quickly than they could have without this kind of deal but congratulations again go to the republican leaders in the house and senate for pushing through the authority for the president to have the ability to make these kinds of deals who says i cant be magnanimous and thank republican leaders i hope the american public will wake up and understand the deal that has been negotiated is deadly to our ally israel it is deadly to the united states make it clear that any party that hopes to have any chance of having a president elected from their party better not be part of the deal with iran because it is going to get more americans and israelis killed i yield back the

from 2015 the bill before us today the socalled restoring americans healthcare freedom reconciliation act is simply more of the same weve been here 61 times before making today the 62nd vote to repeal or undermine the affordable care act enough is enough ultimately we are wasting time on a bill destined for a veto and have many reasons to celebrate its imminent failure this bill is designed to take health insurance from 22 million uninsured americans it would cut the subsidies provided to low and middle income americans living with diabetes and other diseases that allow them to purchase private health insurance it would also eliminate the prevention and public health fund pphf which provides investments in public health efforts to prevent and detect diseases like diabetes and cancer in the first 6 years of the funds inception 5 25 billion in resources have been sent to states tribal and community organizations to support communitybased prevention the fund should be strengthened not eliminated this bill is also designed to repeal the acas medicaid expansion as representative of a state that has opted not to expand its medicaid program i know full well the consequences of nonexpansion the 139 000 working alabamians who fall in the socalled coverage gap make too much to qualify for medicaid and too little to qualify for subsidies my states decision not to expand this critical program is having a devastatingalmost fatalimpact on rural health clinics and hospitals across my district this provision to repeal medicaid expansion would have a devastating impact on the 30 states that have expanded their medicaid program under the affordable care act including 14 states with republican governors the bill is also designed to take away family planning wellness exams and lifesaving cancer screenings from millions of american women the issue of access to reproductive care is very personal to my constituents as some women have to drive two counties to deliver a baby for women in sumter county thats as far as tuscaloosa which is an hour away we shouldnt be in the business of restricting access to family planning and reproductive care in our communities that are already struggling from high teen pregnancy infant mortality and std rates while i am pleased to see an effort to repeal the burdensome cadillac tax and the medical device tax i cannot support this dangerous bill in its entirety i will continue to work with my colleagues to repeal the cadillac and medical device taxes through other legislative vehicles before passage of the aca we were spending more money per patient than any country in the world under the law health care prices have grown at the slowest rate in 50 years this is economic progress that all americans benefit from while the affordable care act is not perfect there are millions of americans who now have access to quality healthcare and are leading healthier lives because of it my constituents and the nurses and doctors who care for them deserve better they deserve a congress that works together to fix whats wrong with our health care system rather that rolling back the progress made by the affordable care act in

the dangers of prescription drugs today it is difficult to imagine a single town in the country that has eluded the devastating grasp of opioid addiction so unite took its model to the national stage over the past 5 years the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit in atlanta has brought together thousands of our countrys brightest most dedicated minds at the federal level we should be replicating unites holistic multipronged approach i am therefore proud to support this bill which will enable communities around the country to unite to implement similar strategies incorporating law

have been able to have these kind of debates on the floor of the house and here we are at 12 30 at night speaking for myself i have listened to the entire debate here tonight on the floor starting with votes after 6 30 i was struck by the amount of amendments having to do with the endangered species act number one and number two having to deal with the lists whether threatened or endangered lists of endangered species act clearlyand i would agree with the gentlewoman on the other side of the aisle on thisreform and major reform of the endangered species act is needed that will take some time that discussion has been ongoing it is nothing that hasnt already started in this congress or in previous congresses i look forward to being a part of that solution in a very constructive way what about the near term we have people human constituents who are really suffering and that is what my amendment is about tonight summer is a big time for any industry that depends on tourism to survive i offer this amendment out of concern for two lake communities in my district just last year during the height of the summers busy tourist season the united states fish and wildlife service required that the northern indiana public service company locally known as nipsco release more water into the tippecanoe river from lake freeman to protect a bed of endangered freshwater mussels that live further down the tippecanoe river all under the guise of the endangered species act as a result in a matter of days water levels on lake freeman dropped dramatically i have visited with local residents near lake freeman multiple times and have seen the lake in person growing up during the summers i spent my time on the sister lake lake shafer many who live and work near the lake discovered to their surprise their boats were stuck businesses were in jeopardy and home values were going down but more than that stumps were rising out of the water and personal health and safety were also in jeopardy as a result now i immediately contacted fish and wildlife and i want to applaud them for their responsiveness and nipsco for working together we created a technical assistance letter otherwise known as a tal it is my estimation that that is going to have some effect again i appreciate the reasonableness of all involved the current plan there is a temporary fix and really we ought to be able to do more now currently fish and wildlife receives funding to enforce the endangered species act which protects six species of mussels that live in the river as the clerk mentioned as he read the amendment the endangered species act gives the highest priority to protected and listed species and there is little anyone can do in terms of exceptions or exemptions or even any kind of balancing test to make sure that there is not a solution that could be a winwin it is a very draconian lawstrict compliance no balancing test no room for discretion or creative solution that is where this reform is needed the statute like i said provides no balancing test for weighing the economic harms and the supreme court of this land has refused to allow us or even lower courts to construct their own test us as citizens compliance with this law as currently written requires diverting water from lake freeman to the tippecanoe river to balance water levels despite consideration of the economic impact and human safety in essence my amendment limits the funding mechanism fish and wildlife would be able to use to enforce the endangered species act with respect to these six types of mussels and eliminates the financial repercussions for failing to enforce the law speaking firsthand with residents lowering these water levels in lake freeman negatively affects the community and small businesses that rely on the tourists who enjoy the lake and the steady water level lower water levels also pose dangerous swimming conditions to both boaters and swimmers as formerly underwater tree stumps breach the water this is unnecessary and a preventable hazard to those who use the lake and again in a winwin way it is all because of this draconian law that although well intended is badly in need of reform so that its practical effect can be overhauled and any of its misguided applications halted hoosiers like myself are just as concerned for the environment as they are for their incomes and family recreation it is not about antienvironmentalism but they believe like i said there is a winwin solution here if only the law would allow such a solution to exist in the meantime we ought to defund fish and wildlifes ability to enforce this law as it is written while i value nature and seek to protect endangered animals the reward of protecting the mussel does not outweigh the economic damage done to this community or the personal safety or health of my human constituents"], [0.9989485144615173, 0.001051485538482666, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 4403 the enhancing overseas traveler vetting act i want to associate myself with the comments of our committee chair particularly his praise for the hard work of mr hurd and the involvement of chairman mccaul of the homeland security committee i am a cosponsor of this legislation and i supported it in the house foreign affairs committee which considered the bill on february 24 and voted it out by voice unanimously with no opposition it is also my understanding that the bill also passed unanimously in the committee on homeland security as the chairman of our committee explained this legislation authorizes the state department and the department of homeland security to develop opensource versions of software that vets travelers against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases once the software is developed we will be able to share it with our allies and multilateral organizations involved in police work such as interpol that means that we will have better software in the hands of worldwide law enforcement sooner and it will be interoperable as things stand now we do not have a comprehensive global database for identifying and tracking terrorists as the bipartisan task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel which was established by chairman mccaul and the committee on homeland security highlighted in its september 2015 report countries including the united states rely on a patchwork system for swapping extremist identities increasing the odds foreign fighters will slip through the cracks the paris and brussels terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a global system since those tragedies there has been finger pointing about missed intelligence and criticism over the lack of information sharing across borders just in february europol warned that more than 5 000 europeans with european passports had traveled to isis and syria to become isis fighters in late march european security officials told the associated press that the islamic state group had trained at least 400 attackers and sent them to europe to carry out specific attacks of course we have a visa waiver relationship with most of europe and that means these european passport holders will be able to visit the united states without special vetting by our officials there is an exception to that for those european passports that have been stamped indicating they visited syria or iraq this should not give us a whole lot of false security because typically foreign fighters who want to join isis travel to turkey where their passport is stamped with a turkish stamp and then they sneak into isiscontrolled areas isis does not stamp their passport entry into the islamic state so the passports of these europeans that have gone to fight for isis in iraq and syria do not bear a syrian or iraqi stamp in addition if for some reason they did bear such a stamp any european can simply go and ask for a replacement passport and in most cases there will be no record available to the united states that this person had ever visited syria or iraq so we need a system that gives us the best possible opportunity to identify foreign fighters but especially those who hold european passports if we are going to fight and prevent global terrorism in tandem with other countries the united states and our allies must be on the same page when it comes to vetting travelers and tracking wouldbe terrorists this legislation helps us do just that i urge my colleagues to support h r i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9971978664398193,

that i can support i strongly believe in encouraging employee ownership through esops options this bill does part we can do a lot more it is a big thing that we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this country has in making sure that workers can participate in capital formation and capital growth along with owners and executives we look forward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the gentleman as well the gentleman from ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses must have access to banking resources the goal of this bill he said oh wait a minute i mean federal ones not state ones not federal not state this is where you have a difference of course you wont have any disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types of businesses that are legal at the state level and are not legal federally but this is where you will find that most democrats believe very strongly in states rights most republicans believe here with the exception of the other gentleman from california who just spoke and a number of others who would allow a majority to support this bill but apparently the gentleman from ohio believes in an overarching federal definition telling states what they can and cant do indirectly through the banking system effectively constraining their ability to allow banks to serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal federally or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might be illegal federally effectively they are arguing that the federal government should tell them what to do and impose a onesizefitsall solution on states that are as diverse as texas and california and colorado and north dakota i disagree with that premise as do most of the democrats here today we feel that while this body of courseand i agree with the gentlemanshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of legal treatment of cannabis products federally that should in no way shape or form stand in the way of a simple fix that says whether you want it to be legal or illegal transactions should be traceable safe through the banking system for businesses that are legal at the state level let me address h r 1675 the encouraging employee ownership act also being named the capital markets improvement act it is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that i think can be made even better through the amendment process title i of this bill which will revise the secs rule 701 by raising and indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can issue stock to employees without running into government red tape is a commonsense good piece of legislation i hope it is something that most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with i am an early cosponsor of this legislation and i think we should promote and applaud the structure the indexation and of course allowing employees to have a stake in their companies that is not the only solution the gentleman from california might have some other ideas i look forward to discussing as do i but if you want to help solve some of our nations issues with income inequality and the wealth gap then we should applaud and promote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you operate in esop or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit from the growth of your company we should find ways to work together to promote and encourage this style of corporate governance title ii is a safe harbor for investment research a bill that will help improve available market information for investors and something that has broad bipartisan support i know my colleague from delaware will also be pleased to see this pass as an original sponsor my colleague from ohio who is a cochair with me of the congressional caucus for middle market growth spoke yesterday and today about how this overall package of legislation will help grow companies in the allimportant middle market this is main street america these are companies that might not be big enough to be multinational multibilliondollar brand names and they are not startups or small companies but it is the engine of our economy the portion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine creating jobs on main street title iii of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very middle market companies these provisions have broad bipartisan support and i applaud them the sec has largely agreed with this in fact the only argument against it has been we already do this and i think that is a weak argument because we ought to put it in statute the sec has agreed and has taken action but unfortunately some of their actions have added in some increased investor impediments as well i hope the administration can work with congress to improve this bill if there are specific issues they have with it but the bill is necessary it is better to fix things in statute i think that we can work together to reduce red tape to grow small and middlesized companies title v of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that is in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in many agencies it is the sort of good government legislation i think both sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support now title iv of h r 1675 unfortunately is a bit of a step in the wrong direction and it is something we discussed extensively in the committee yesterday fortunately for this provision there was an open process mr issa and mr ellison have amendments that will be considered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely unfortunately the bill as written is a move away from searchable financial reporting that can be done digitally it is a step away from sortable and downloadable formats it is a return to the pen and paper and inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to the open data transparency world of the 21st century across the board market participants investors and regulators want information that is already requiredwe are not talking about any new requirementsinformation that is already required financial information to simply be available in a digital searchable format that is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate it is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with this information by hand by pen by paper it puts investors and others at an enormous disadvantage and it prevents and reduces the amount of information in the marketplace searchable and sortable data can be better used to track trends find anomalies find investment opportunities and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and hopefully catch the next enron before it explodes just as importantly investors need information so do entrepreneurial folks who want to take this information and package it in new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to institutional and individual investors we heard yesterday from detractors who said investors arent asking for this information we also heard that the committee didnt include any investors in their testimony they only included operating companies i am not sure who they are speaking for but in my conversations i have never heard any investor say i want less information or i want information to be harder to search or find no investor says i want to know less about a companys earnings i want it to be in an archaic pen and paper format that argument that this information isnt welcome by investors is simply incorrect and it is counter to anything you will ever hear from anyone in the investment community hopefully we will fix these issues through amendment overall i believe this package should merit serious consideration and support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle h r 766 the financial institution customer protection act does address a very important issue and that is the inexcusable actions of operation choke point which at best could be described as an overzealous use of the department of justices power or at worst as a pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be politically unpopular unfortunately as we examine this bill it looks like it has some unintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment process the amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment that would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated marijuana industry in 22 states i hope that we can address the operation choke point issue i hope we can prevent this administration and future administrations from engaging having doj engage in this kind of troublesome use of authority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and legal customers of local financial institutions if a bank or credit union has a legal business it is legal in the state they deem it creditworthy they are a good customer and they want to open an account with them they should be able to serve that customer the federal government should not use the bank itself as an intermediary in a dispute if the doj has a dispute with a banks customer that should be resolved between the doj and the customer not the bank i hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this area that can ensure that this president and future presidents and the future department of justices do not abuse their authority in this area one reallife everyday issue where this concept comes up of the department of justice and the federal government interfering with the bank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the perlmutter amendment that i spoke about earlier it is not just a colorado issue frankly if this bill addressed that issue despite it being overarching in other areas i would probably support it thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in our state but unfortunately not even a minute not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue the gentleman from ohio claimed that we were having that debate to be clear we are not we are debating the underlying rule there is no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for opponents of the amendment to make their case we are outlaying the time for other amendments many amendments have 10 minutes many amendments have more there is not even a second for the debate of that amendment sponsored by mr perlmutter that is why i cannot support this rule 213 million americans live in a state or jurisdiction where the voters have allowed for some legal marijuana use colorado tried to solve the problem locally but we were rejected by federal banking regulators in courts so congress needs to be the one to make this change only congress can address this issue while there remains a need to align federal and state laws while the doj and treasury have issued some guidance some institutions are providing banking services to the doj and treasury guidance issues the guidance does not solve the problem which is why we need to change the law and provide certainty which this very simple amendment that has bipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have done but it is completely shut down under this rule even though it furthers the actual goal of the legislation is germane to the legislation is consistent with the legislation and yet it is completely shut down in a closed process that runs contrary to the

required under section 402 of the congressional budget act of 1974 budget act the macroeconomic effects of major legislation because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates it does not apply to appropriations legislation by including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy this rule provides the house with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy in particular this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output employment the capital stock and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation in addition this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues outlays or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0 25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year in applying the 0 25 percent threshold cbo and jct are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation in carrying out this requirement the intent is that cbo and jct review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect thus the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out alternately for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect but would still have significant economic impacts the new rule empowers the house to designate major legislation for all legislation other than purely revenue legislation the rule authorizes the chair of the budget committee to designate major legislation for purely revenue legislation i e legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201 f of the budget act the rule authorizes the house member serving as the chair or vice chair of jct to designate major legislation for purposes of this rule the rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between cbo and jct which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions when major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions cbo and jct will need to work together to produce a single integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities the rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates both cbo and jct as applicable must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates it is important that cbo and jct make this information available so that the public academic and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that jct provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses the preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate both cbo and jct should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule to the extent it is not practicable for cbo and jct to produce the required estimates the rule provides an accommodation in this instance two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis first committees and the house may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for cbo or jct to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration second while cbo and jct have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses there may be situations where it is not possible for cbo and jct to produce the required analysis the material previously referred to by ms slaughter is as follows"],

united states there were 41 000 suicide deaths in this country there were 45 000 deaths from drug overdoses many of those folks suffered from depression there were an estimated 1 200 homicides by people who are seriously mentally ill about half of all deadly police encounters occurred with someone who is mentally ill there is an unknown number of mentally ill who died 25 years sooner because they tend to die of chronic illnesses there is about one homeless person per day in los angeles who dies we know about 200 000 homeless people in this country are mentally ill it is a sad case in any numbers but if you add those numbers up even the most conservative version is that there were some 85 000 deaths last year related to mental illnessand it is probably much higherand more have died from mental illnessrelated problems than the total united states combat deaths of the entire korean war and vietnam wars combined that is sobering but it is worse it is worse because we could prevent a large number of these mental illness problems we could save many of those with mental illness from their early demise we could save their families from suffering but unfortunately the federal government is the problem let me lay out this evening in this special order some of the particular problems that we have in particular for those who are low income medicaid itself is one of the biggest discriminators against people with mental illness getting treatment first consider this fifteen percent of medicaid recipients have serious mental illness that is far more than the general population serious mental illness is things like schizophrenia bipolar illness schizoaffective disorder and severe depression thirtyone percent of those on ssi have serious mental illness twentysix percent of those with social security disability have serious mental illness in the general population by the way there is only about 1 percent with schizophrenia about 2 6 of the general population have been diagnosed as bipolar so look at how much higher those numbers are among the poor that makes sense because mentally ill people are three times more likely to have low income as a result of their mental illness lowincome individuals are three times more likely to have mental illness many as a result of being poor poverty and homelessness are both associated with serious mental illness both are associated with inadequate primary care and preventative care but here are some ways that medicaid makes it harder for people with mental illness to get care first of all there is a rule called the sameday doctor rule if you take someone to the doctor and the internist or family physician is very concerned that person has a mental illness they are told they have to come back another day before they can see the psychiatrist that is a serious problem because when you have the warm handoff in the doctors office you have 95 percent that will return versus less than half if they have to come back another day and treatment is the key to getting better there is a 16bed rule from the institute of mental diseases which says that if the hospital has more than 16 beds and you are between ages 22 and 64 we are not paying for it the problem with that is that serious mental illness tends to emerge in 50 percent of the cases by age 14 and in 75 percent of the cases by age 24 so at the very time when problems are emerging the very time when someone may have their first serious crisis that may require some inpatient care they are told there will be no room only 45 percent of medicaid recipients with schizophrenia actually get evidencebased care only 35 percent of those with a bipolar diagnosis who are on medicaid get evidencebased care listen to this statistic ninetytwo percent of lowincome children and foster children are prescribed drugs off labelthose are drugs that are not approved by fdaaccording to an hhs inspector generals report and many of those prescriptions according to the report are done without clinical justification the homeless with schizophrenia have a rate of hospitalization for complications of hypertension almost twice as high as others fifty percent of individuals with schizophrenia are noncompliant with treatment regimens during their illness and dont adhere to medications they need assistance in doing so also half of those with serious mental illness have at least two chronic physical health conditions such as chronic pulmonary disease infectious disease cardiovascular disease gastrointestinal problems and these people are generally in poorer health so what happens is that those with serious mental illness and a number of other clinical aspects have compromised physical symptoms and we dont have a place to treat them we used to have 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s now we have less than 40 000 during that same time the population of the united states climbed from 150 million to over 300 million today so where do people who have an acute mental health crisis go sadly whether it is acute or chronic about 200 000 of our homeless are mentally ill twentyeight percent of them get some of their food out of a garbage can we also have a large portion of those with mental illness filling our prisons when we closed down those psychiatric hospitals some got better but basically we traded the hospital bed for the prison cot a blanket over a subway grate an emergency room or a gurney or a slab in some morgue the incarceration rate among the seriously mentally ill is 16 percent of the population some 60 percent of the incarcerated may have some level of mental illness and then what happens in the area of violence well in general people with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population but when untreated serious mental illness occurs they are 16 times more likely to be perpetrators of violence as i said before there are over 1 000 homicides a year and we have no idea how many are victims of crime estimates are it is 6 to 10 times greater what happens if a person with mental illness is not treated the longer a person waits for treatment for a psychotic episode the longer it takes a persons illness to come into remission that means it costs more for bipolar illness the sooner a person starts lithium the greater their improvement it means it would cost less if we treated them delusions hallucinations and other severe symptoms increase the longer treatment is withheld as far as the costs go the cost of schizophrenia alone far exceeds that of coronary artery disease the mortality rates of schizophrenia are far more than breast cancer the costs of serious mental illness in this country are about 55 billion in direct costs and 70 billion in indirect costs but there is also the added cost of emergency room care added cost of primary care and the cost of treating their other medical problems the deinstitutionalization move in this country is associated with much higher suicide rates such that while our country has made great strides in reducing mortality rates over the last couple of decades in heart disease auto accidents hiv aids

requires a great deal of change on our part that means we are going to have to do something to help people with mental illness get treatment half are simply not compliant and dont adhere to their medication they get worse their medical problems get worse the medicaid bills get higher half of those with serious mental illness as i said have two or more chronic physical health conditions and it

advocate for coal ash to be regulated under subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra which would ensure that the recycling of coal ash continues without disruption the beneficial reuse of coal ash is responsible for tens of thousands of jobs around the countryhelping our economy and our environment i appreciate epas decision to regulate coal ash as a nonhazardous waste in its april final rule however i do have concerns with the other parts of epas new regulations in particular the rule is selfimplementing meaning that it does not require permits to be issued and the federal government will have no authority to enforce epas standards the best way forward is to create a statebased permitting program with minimum federal standards this legislation does just that taking many of epas requirements and folding them into state permitting programs the program created by this bill would give states the flexibility to meet their unique conditions and empower state agencies to enforce environmental and safety requirements that will protect communities and the environment epa will be authorized to stepin for states that do not create their own programs this chamber passed coal ash legislation with bipartisan support in 2011 and 2013 the legislation before us today is an improvement on those bills and provides stronger protections for human health and the

judges that wrote to the committee on behalf of the conference that they had been schooled by justice scalia here is what justice scalia himself had to say about this he specifically opposed the weakening of rule 11 when it occurred in 1993 writing that it would render the rule toothless by allowing judges to dispense with sanction by disfavoring compensation for litigation expenses and by providing a 21day safe harbor entitling the party accused of a frivolous filing to escape with no sanction at all justice scalia further observed in my view those who file frivolous suits and pleadings should have no safe harbor the rules should be solicitous of the abused the courts and the opposing party and not of the abuser under the revised rule parties will be able to file thoughtless reckless and harassing pleadings secure in the knowledge that they have nothing to lose if objection is raised they can retreat without penalty so i also want to say that the gentleman from tennessee and i agree on one of the great hallmarks of this country and that is our judicial system the hallmark of our judicial system is that when you are victimized in this country you have a place where you can go and seek justice that is exactly what mr smiths bill does it allows people who are victimized by aggressive plaintiffsabusive frivolous and fraudulent lawsuitsto be able to get justice themselves because when you are the victim of an expensive costly lawsuit that can damage your business damage your reputation cost you huge amounts of money you are indeed a victim if the court finds that that whole lawsuit was brought on a frivolous basis and yet i challenge again the other side of the aisle and those who oppose this legislation to name one other sort of legal claimjust onewhere the victim is able to prove in court their damages and then be denied those damages by the judge they have not done that they have not made their case in this court the peoples

foreign affairs committee ileana roslehtinen for sponsoring this resolution i agree with every word she just said she has been a good friend to the state and people of israel and this measure which i am happy to cosponsor shows once again that support for israel in congress is not a partisan issue israel has much bipartisan support in this congress and we intend to keep it this way as the congresswoman has mentioned the violence in israel has gone from bad to worse in recent days day after day we hear new reports of innocent israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of palestinian terrorists i use the word terrorist because what they are doing are acts of terrorism if random people average citizens have nothing to do with policy have nothing to do with politicsthey are just civilians that are walking in the streetif they are attacked by a knife or something else that harms them that is a terrorist attack imagine if we had such things going on in the united states it would have a chilling effect on what people can do and whether they can move around or cant move around as a result of it so this is not something that is random it is not something that is confined it can strike anybody at any time any place and it is terrorism i have often said that while i support a twostate solution if the palestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get them closer to their state they are wrong it will prevent them from ever having a state if they dont renounce terrorism that is what this is all about it is the incitement it is the encouraging of hatred for israelis and the jews and for the united states as well this goes on time and time and time again and then we wonder why we have these acts of violence because you cannot fan the fires and be a leader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say well you know we are not encouraging it the palestinian authority has been irresponsible and they have been irresponsible for many many years so as it has every right to do israel has defended itself against these attacks these stabbings and shootings but this bloodshed must be brought to an end i have no doubt that it could be in a hurry if palestinian leaders would do the right thing repudiate the violence and most importantly the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes jews and israelis and glorifies terrorists chairman royce and i will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by more than 350 of our colleagues in both parties i am very very happy with the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this letter that is why chairman royce and i try to do things in a bipartisan manner because something like this is bipartisan support for israel is bipartisan support against terror is bipartisan we have to stand together as americans regardless of party affiliation and say we will not countenance terror and we are going to point fingers at the palestinian authority who has been utterly irresponsible in this whole thing so if palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the violence and most importantly end the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes jews and israelis and glorifies terrorists this could stop this letter that chairman royce and i have done signed by more than 350 of our colleagues to palestinian president abbas urges him to take that course but i cannot say that i have high hopes after all this type of rhetoric by palestinians against jews and israelis and even just americans in general is nothing new in palestinian books and newspapers on the television and radio we see and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement from a young age palestinians are taught that the people of israel are their enemies and those who use violence are heroes and this is very very infuriating it is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today and it is a roadblock as i said before on the path towards a twostate solution palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of terrorists it is a dead end for them and it is counterproductive they ought to know it they are doing their people a tremendous disservice this resolution calls on palestinian leaders to show real responsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return to the negotiating table

for her continued pursuit of making sure we pass this this bill was first introduced over a year ago reworked with a lot of bipartisan input members of congress from both sides of the aisle and also from many many organizations the other day some 23 organizations delivered a letter to some members of congress saying they want to see comprehensive mental health reform this is the first and the most comprehensive mental health reform our country has seen the last time some efforts were made it was the very last bill that president kennedy signed before he was assassinated to begin to make some change in our country to move away from the asylums and towards community mental health unfortunately that dream only came partially true because what happened is we closed those asylums back in the 1950s we had 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in this country at that time the population of the country was 150 million now the population of the country is over 316 million 320 million and we only have 40 000 psych beds now some of that is because we have come up with more effective treatments better ways of identifying and diagnosing people better medications and quite frankly those asylums of yesteryear needed to close many times they were homes of abuse and given nicknames like snake pits cuckoos nests and other derogatory terms because they were so bad but then along came community medical health centers and that was supposed to pick up the slack as states found that they could close these asylums they looked and saw that they could save some money and they didnt put the money into mental health services nor did the federal government what happened instead was the people traded the hospital bed for the jail cell for the homeless shelter and for the morgue that is where we are today now it is not for lack of trying because indeed the federal government has spent a lot of moneysome 100plus billion a yearon this mostly through disability payments but some for federal programs what i want to do tonight is now talk about 10 things we can do as a nation to deal with this 10 things we must do first of all the general accounting office report that we commissioned from the energy and commerce committee we said tell us what programs there are in the federal government that deal with mental health and more specifically serious mental illness i was amazed to hear how many there were 112 agencies scattered across eight departments it is a dysfunctional and uncoordinated system it is a system that really does not have central control it is a system that has not even met among these agencies for years even though one of the agencies samhsa substance abuse and mental health services administration is supposed to be the lead agency to say get together and meet they hadnt even met since 2009 by the way when we had a hearing on this in the oversight and investigations subcommittee they said oh we will start doing that soon but this report that came out that excoriated the federal programs said that they are not only uncoordinated but nobody even checks to see if what they do works they are programs with the department of defense veterans affairs education health and human services hud the list goes on and on i think there are 20plus programs for homelessness there was redundancy and there was overlap but it is not coordinated we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty so here is number one of what we want to do we want to have the office of the assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse createda new office but not new money we do not need any money for this we take the current office of samhsa and elevate that title of the person who runs that agency to the level of an assistant secretary that persons job will be to create an annual report to congress to tell us the state of the states tell us how they spend their money that they get from the federal level tell us what are the best practices out there that can serve as models for other states collect that data right now what we do get is data on numbers of suicides we get some homicide data but we really dont get that much on homeless data we have soso quality of data for substance abuse what happens there but for the most part no one asks about these agencies and coordinates them this persons job is to do this more so this person is going to have to be a mental health provider someone who understands the field the last director of samhsa was an attorney perhaps wellintended but did not understand the field just like you would not appoint someone to head the joint chiefs of staff to run the army who is not a general or the navy who is not an admiral you need someone to run this who knows what they are doing in addition to coordinating these agencies what they would do is give a report to congress of which ones can be eliminated because they are redundant merge the money together make more money available and send more money out to communities let congress then act to revamp these multiple organizations to do what is most effective to get funding back to the communities and to the people where it is needed not to stay in washington d c i think president reagan talked about perhaps some proof of eternity is a federal program what we dont want to have here is the continuation of programs that exist just for the sake of employment programs should exist for the sake of doing the right thing for people out there and right now we have a failure the second item is to drive evidencebased care another general accounting office report which came out talked about some of the abysmal conditions here they were saying that agencies had difficulty identifying programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness because they didnt always track whether or not such individuals were among those served by the program again samhsa in the pastwhich is supposed to lead these organizationsdoesnt really track to say what are the evidencebased programs you are doing when we had a hearing on these issues samhsa told me afterwards they would change nothing they do list some evidencebased programs but the evidence base is oftentimes people who do programs and say take my word for it it works if it works why do we have millions of people with mental illness why do we have 4 million people not getting any care at all why do we continue to fill our jails homeless shelters and morgues with people with mental illness there are some excellent programs out there quite frankly but there are also many that need to be changed as part of this process it was stated in the gao report that many of the programs hadnt completed their evaluations many had no evaluations some were underway and 17 programs had no evaluation completed and none planned so the government was not even looking to see if what they were doing had any value we are going to change that we are going to make sure the programs that are out there have evidencebased care the national child traumatic stress network is an excellent program that does a great job another program is called raise response after initial schizophrenia episode it does a great job because they work in terms of getting care early in someones life when they first show symptoms it is called the prodromal stage when you get to someone early you improve their prognosis but a lot of these other programsand i will highlight some of the sloppy and irrational programs we have out here tonightcan make a difference if they are done the right way it is important to note that with regard to serious mental illness about 50 percent of those with serious mental illness it will emerge by age 14 and about 75 percent of the cases by age 24 every time a person has what the public popularly knows as a breakdown or we refer to it as a psychological or psychiatric crisis there is harm that occurs to the person psychological harm and neurological harm because it is a brain disease so it is important to get to people early on that is why we want evidencebased care that really and truly does that and not programs that are fluff we want them to have outcome measures and determine them by the way just the opposite of that some of the things that samhsa has funded in the past have also been programs specifically geared toward telling people to stop taking their medication when people have anxiety they have plans in telling you how to drink a fruit smoothie none of those are evidencebased care and none of those treat people with serious mental illness number three go to the mental health workforce we have a serious serious shortage here of providers even if you wanted to get care you cant get care in many counties i think perhaps onefourth or onethird of counties in oregon do not even have a psychiatrist in them many do not have a clinical psychologist or clinical social workers or peer support teams with the adequacy to meet the need it is the same across the nation what happens here is there are about 9 000 child psychiatrists in this country we need 30 000 precisely for the reason i said before that these problems emerge during those adolescent and young adult years if you dont have the right qualified people you cant treat them similarly clinical psychologists counseling psychologists clinical social workers and peer support teams specifically trained and available to be out there we have massive shortages part of the job of the assistant secretary is going to be to identify what do we need in communities and how do we get them our bill authorizes for the first time minorities to work with fellowships we also authorize people to be volunteers at community health centers this is one of the bizarre things that only the federal government can do if you want to work at a community health center you can work and your medical malpractice insurance is covered if you want to volunteer it is not there now think about this if there are some wellintended and compassionateas i know many aremental health providers who want to volunteer maybe an afternoon a week give of their time to help they are not allowed to do it because the center cant afford their malpractice insurance because they would have to pay the regular rate as opposed to a federal plan rate our bill also authorizes that they can volunteer we also authorize programs with telemedicine so that when a pediatrician or a family member identifies someone in need of care they can access them immediately if need be especially in rural areas and faraway areas where there is not enough support there the next one is the shortage of mental health beds i had mentioned earlier this grave shortage where we had 550 000 beds in the 1950s we have 40 000 today it is a serious crisislevel shortage in every community during one of our hearings senator creigh deeds a state senator in virginia testified many are familiar with his story he was a former gubernatorial candidate in virginia and he took his son gus with him oftentimes campaigning around the state of virginia gus played a musical instrument and they enjoyed their time together but sadly gus deteriorated when his father who raised him fed him and clothed him took him to a hospital for care the hospital said we dont have any psych beds as they made calls and tried to find more in virginia they couldnt find any young gus was sent home with his father they wouldnt provide many details but they sent gus home gus took a knife and attacked his father nearly killing him creigh escaped and gus then killed himself all because of a lack of beds there was a story last week in the washington post about another virginia man a 24yearold man who was arrested for 5 worth of shoplifting at a 7eleven in virginia he was taken to jail for shoplifting but upon recognizing that he had a serious mental illness they wanted to get him to a hospital again there werent beds available so he stayed in that jail i believe over 70 days often naked covered in his own feces refusing to eat and losing 40 pounds ultimately he died for lack of a bed now that is not the only problem that is out there understand that we dont want to bring back those asylums but when a person is in that crisis mode it is not appropriate to bring them to a jail it is not appropriate to leave them in an emergency room for hours or days or weeks sometimes waiting for a hospital bed to open up and it certainly is inappropriate to discharge someone without any wraparound services or care but what happens is when you have a bed shortage you cannot get care for crisis by qualified persons we dont have the providers we dont have the places it is important for someone to have a clean and calm and caring environment separate from other environmental stresses and problems so you can work with them and stabilize them perhaps get them on medication help them relax help organize things for home care or outpatient care for them sometimes that takes a few days sometimes that takes a couple weeks but the idea is you need a place for them without beds oftentimes a staff simply cannot do a thorough evaluation and they sometimes then will simply make an uninformed and premature release of the individual of the consumer saying well he doesnt seem that bad we will send him home not really understanding whether or not that person is a threat to themselves or someone else understand this that even with the brain diseases of schizophrenia and bipolar when questioned someone could be in a position where when asked if they are going to harm themselves or someone else they would say no i am fine really it is okay it was just a disagreement i had they can keep it together for a little bit and if a staff is already saying look we dont have hospital beds lets send him home they will be sent home without really knowing the seriousness of their illness or providing full services further if you want to evaluate if someone is a threat to harm themselves or someone else or in imminent danger of that many times the doctors and the courts are reluctant to go through that process many times they are looking for another out and many timeslike in pennsylvania it is called a 302 procedurethey will bypass that or they will say to the patient can you just voluntarily commit yourself or promise you will be okay and you will go out and get care i want to add this because it is very important while the president and other people are talking about access to guns and talking about background checks you cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordyou cant do a background check if you dont have a background recordand if there is no place to help people when they are in crisis and if doctors and judges are not going to have someone involuntarily committed there is no record there is nothing that can appear on the national list to prevent a person from purchasing a firearm there was no time spent in a hospital where staff can truly evaluate are these delusions and hallucinations which can be controlled with medication will the person be stabilized are they a risk threat you cant do that we need more beds and our bill says there will be more this is one of those areas of incredible prejudices and bigotry you see medicaid has this rule that if you are between the ages of 21 and 64 you cannot go into a private hospital that has more than 16 beds now think about that if you have money you can go in a hospital if you are low income you are out of luck you are on the street it is a different standard that is grossly unfair and incredibly prejudicial and again i go to this point that those who are minorities or low income are treated the worst a person is ten times more likely to be treated in a jail cell than in a hospital if they are seriously mentally illten times more likely and yet that treatment in a jail cell is not appropriate at all it is not treatment oftentimes they are put in isolation they may get in a fight with a guard what started off as a small charge may end up as a felony assault charge a person with serious mental illness oftentimes for the same crime will spend four times the amount in jail as a person who is not mentally ill and all along if we had the proper place to treat them we could have done that our bill lifts this 16bed cap this ridiculously absurd 16bed cap and says instead we would like to have an average length of stay of less than 30 days that can be achieved in about 98 percent of cases it can be achieved and by the way it is far less expensive to have someone in a psychiatric hospital bed than an emergency room by about four times some studies have gone as high as saying it is about 20 times less expensive to have them in outpatient care than in a jail cell we would save a lot more money if we fixed this crisis shortage worked on other outpatient care to transition people out and wrap them around with the necessary services so they could go out more stable point number five we eliminate the same day doctor barrier another one of those ridiculously prejudicial rules out there that medicaid has that harms those of low income i mentioned a number of times that the prodromal stages of adolescents and young adulthood is when serious mental illness begins to emerge those first symptoms that sometimes someone may think is a little bit strange there is something different about this person perhaps their grades are dropping perhaps they are not taking care of themselves the way they used to perhaps they are withdrawing from relationships and friends those could be early signs of a bigger problem but it takes between first symptoms and first professional treatment on average 110 weeks over 2 years of waiting time between first symptoms in part because people are not aware of what to look for in the symptoms but in part because they are not connected with other providers here and even when they are they are not allowed to do anything the same day doctor rule is a medicaid rule which says you cant see two doctors in the same day at the same location so here is the problem if a pediatrician says to a mother or father we are very concerned about your teenage son who is in the later years 17 or so i would like him to see a psychiatrist right away because i am very concerned about the behaviors you are describing to me and then when that doctor realizes that that person is on medicaid basically medicaid says we are not paying for it how cruel and abusive is that to say to someone just because you have low income we are not going to cover the services here when this is a critical time when you have that warm handoff in the doctors office there is a 95 percent likelihood that the person will follow up according to a study by childrens hospital of pittsburgh when you wait and you say here is the number call it another day that likelihood drops below 45 percent and when you miss that golden opportunity to help a person in times of need that person may be very reluctant to come back for care in the future we fix this by saying we are going to drop that same day doctor rule number six we have to empower parents and caregivers to be part of the solution twenty years ago hipaa laws came out that said in order to help your insurance be portable we want to protect the records good idea we wanted to make sure records had privacy good idea but hipaa moved from the place where we are supposed to assist care and confidentiality to the point where it impairs care it has gone too far let me give you a couple of examples right now a doctorand i am a psychologist if i know a family member brings someone in to see me i can listen to them in a very passive mode but i cant provide them any information that is helpful they are giving me vital information for history if i dont have the accurate history a provider does not have accurate history you cant accurately diagnose you dont know if the person has been on medication before does it work or not work who has this person seen before what sets them off are they doing better what are their symptoms if i dont have or a provider does not have that information they may miss making the accurate diagnosis and then not be able to provide proper treatment and followup when that occurs harm can follow now if i get the information great but what happens if that family member is not there the provider cant go out and seek other family members and friends to get that information because hipaa laws are seen as barriers to that because as soon as a doctor at a hospital calls and says your adult son is in the hospital i need to ask you some information about it that doctor has already violated hipaa laws by identifying the persons son is in a hospital now think about this though a parent the person who was caring and loving throughout a lifetime committed to their family member a brother a sister someones mother or father they are prohibited from being part of the care team by hipaa laws a stranger some appointed worker someone who may see them as they roll in and out of their job even if they care and they burn out they will be maybe sitting next to a family member in court and simply say i cant tell you anything about this family member you will have to find out for yourself here is another problem though not only are you impaired from getting diagnostic information you cant evaluate medications but understand that people with serious mental illness are often at high risk for other medical problems in part because their hygiene may be poor they may not take care of themselves may not see doctors et cetera but they also are in a situation where they may take some medications that make them high risk for diabetes or heart disease and without getting a family member to help them with that they do not have the ability to properly treat them my goal in this bill is to simply say that in cases where someone has diminished capacity to take care of themselves where in absence of treatment they become gravely disabled a provider may tell a known caregiverso notice i have already set the bar pretty highmay tell a known caregiver a few simple facts the diagnosis the treatment plan the treating doctors time and place of appointment and what are the medications they are on no therapy notes are allowed to be exchanged we specifically prohibit that in this bill but that is important and by the way i might add one other thing as i hear a lot of people talking about the concerns of why didnt a parent do anything why didnt they know anything in some cases like the young man at virginia tech who killed so many students or the gentlemen in oregon or at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut it is because providers cannot do a risk assessment they cannot contact a family member and say can you tell me if this person has any morbid fantasy and fascination with death with extremely violent video games with dark web sites do they have weapons that are unsecured do they talk about violent issues have they made threats before you cant do that risk assessment without that you end up not knowing the risk number seven states receive money for mental health services and substance abuse disorders those dollars are about 500 million for mental health and about 600 to 700 million for substance abuse the odd thing about this is states are not allowed to mingle that money they cant braid it together even worse is that many people with a substance abuse disorder have a mental illness and many people with mental illness will turn toward other substances to selfmedicate and yet the person will have to go to two different providers two different clinics to get care instead of one we drop that barrier and say federal grants should go to states in a way that help the states work this best number eight we want to bring accountability to the spending of federal funds now here is where we have seen in another gao report the absolute absurdity and cruelty of how money is spent a gao report done this last summer told us that many times documents and applications for many who receive grants were not reviewed they couldnt tell you what the application criterion was to get an award they didnt have programspecific guidance information was missing or not readily available they didnt even know where it was stored you couldnt follow the paper trail to see where it was and so what happens is no one knows how this money was spent but let me tell you some of the absurd things we have found money is spent on our tax dollars how about this a web site last winter was posted by samhsa for the people of boston to help them with their worries about snow that is right they posted a 1800 number you could call if you had snow anxiety these are people from new england for goodness sake they know how to handle snow but our tax dollars went to help them understand it there are web sites that tell you to drink a fruit smoothie if you are anxious programs that tell you how to make a mask programs that we fund to how to make collages a painting in samhsas headquarters that cost 22 500 of two people sitting on a rock surrounded by other people 22 000 when we asked the director of samhsa what that was for they said it is more mental health awareness the only thing i am aware of is it is a waste of money and that money could have gone to help pay someones salary to actually treat a patient well it gets worse a web site for 3yearold children the cost of 426 000 with animated characters and singalong songs the purpose we asked the director of samhsa prevention prevention of what we said well we think prevention is good well what does this prevent and what does it do and does it work and does it do anything we waited for weeks to get an answer and we still dont have it 1 month later by the way they took the web site down when we shined a bright light on it saying what does this do we want accountability to this spending there will be different grant programs nowdemonstration grants innovation grantswhere people will know what these grants are they can look at them as scientific studies in a blind review to make sure it is going to quality programs that really make sense no more of this behavioral wellness stuff but truly working at things that make a difference number nine develop alternatives to institutionalization and have real jail diversion i said already what happens to so many people with mental illness they end up in jail forty to sixty percent of people in prison have a mental illness and what this does is it helps provide some extra funding for states that have wraparound services for those who have this history of violent incarcerations arrests mental illness new york has a program called assisted outpatient treatment their program which means a judge will say you need to stay in treatment at an outpatient level has found they reduced incarcerations by 81 percent they reduced homelessness by over 70 percent they reduced admissions to emergency rooms by over 70 percent they had patient satisfaction consumer satisfaction at over 90 percent and they cut costs in half states have different programs here about 46 states have something on the books but many of these states do not put these programs in practice because of the big cost we know states will save a lot of money once they start doing this but what we want to do is take people out of this cycle this revolving door of jail and risk and more damage and say that states need to have programs where it wraps around services for that person dont just dump them from jail onto the streets and expect a problem because it will erupt again make sure those services are there make sure the person stays in treatment now some say well that is unfair some say that might be an involuntary commitment that it puts people there against their will and you impair their rights but i say this that a person with serious mental illness 40 percent of the time is not even aware they have a problem and so many times they refuse treatment or their past runins with the police and other hospitals because they dont want to be there they dont want to get treatment if we provide quality compassionate accessible care they may get that but not under the current system we want to make sure they have that care and we will provide the funding to do it number 10 advance early intervention and prevention programs a lot of what our government spends money on is what is called primary prevention the things we do for everybody like dont smoke wear a seat belt but what happens is in the area of mental illness those wellness programs like i described before that are out there the silly things that samhsa does are not an effective use of dollars secondary and tertiary prevention is valuable secondary is when you recognize someone is at risk but not with symptoms tertiary is when they have symptoms and you try and help them get better by focusing money on the programs i mentioned beforethe raise program or others the child and adolescent traumatic stress networkyou can move the dollars where they need to be funded and stop this silliness now i should say this while i am talking about samhsa that despite two gao reports that criticize themand one time afterwards i had the director of samhsa in my office and i said okay here is your opportunity would you change anything and she said no i wouldnt change a thing another time during one of our hearings one of my colleagues said on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you rate yourself on your programs and the director said i would give myself a 10 despite all these failures that is the reason why we need to have an assistant secretary of mental health that is the reason why we need to make these changes this is the current reason why we have so many of these problems before i wrap up here i want to yield a couple of minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania who has also been involved in the

regardless of whether or not the veteran who chooses medical foster home care is eligible for more costly vapaid nursing home care this creates a situation where many serviceconnected veterans are

that is what we are trying to correct here because there is no gmo oat it is all to convince consumers that it is somehow safer even though there is no distinction between that cheerios that has that

from our early 20th century history i do believe that it is a subject that needs to be looked at i am just not prepared to say today that the gentleman has necessarily gotten it right there is probably something very humorous today about siting a federal reserve bank in the same city as disney world i will refrain from making any such humorous references but again i think the gentleman makes a good point i would like this issue to go through regular order i believe it is a matter that chairman huizenga and the monetary policy and trade subcommittee of our full committee will be taking a look at are these appropriate cities for the federal reserve banks to be sited so again i thank the gentleman for bringing the matter to the houses attention i thank him for bringing it to my attention but i am not prepared to say that san francisco l a or orlando are necessarily the places that federal reserve banks ought to end up without going through regular order so i want to look at
