democrat the gentleman from ohio with all the white house has been doing over the last couple of weeks the american people are justified in asking what in blazes is going on with the clinton administration and specifically what is up with his budget while the concern is real the focus may be a little off indeed many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized deduction limit at about 1 2 percent tell me what is the incentive for him or her to engage in the type of economic activity our economy needs this"], [3.2186508178710938e-06, 0.9999967813491821, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding to me as the congressional black caucus begins its 23d annual legislative weekend i join my colleagues in rising to honor the outstanding contributions and dedicated service of former supreme court justice thurgood marshall this years legislative weekend theme is generations celebrating the legacy of africanamerican leadership and so today it is certainly with respect and pride that we are celebrating the legacy of this nations greatest supreme court justice justice thurgood marshall justice marshall will be remembered forever as americas leading crusader in the fight for equality and justice he vigorously served as a true pillar of the civil rights movement as the chief architect of the legal strategy which questioned and subsequently put an end to officially sanctioned segregation in the united states justice marshalls legacy is destined to influence the lives of many for years to come a celebration of the legacy of africanamerican leadership would not be complete without the observance and acknowledgement of the profound contributions and achievements of this truly distinguished leader hindered by numerous obstacles countless confrontations and seemingly insurmountable challenges justice marshall always seemed to rise to the occasion he was forced to valiantly display his cunning ability to persevere in spite of all odds and forces working against him early on in life after completing high school justice marshall went on to attend lincoln university in pennsylvania in 1925 and upon graduation applied to the state law school in baltimore however because of the segregated time in which he grew up thurgood marshall was not admitted because of the color of his skin as a result he registered at howard university law school whereupon he graduated at the top of his class in 1933 and began a solo law practice in baltimore during the depths of the depression with an undying passion in his heart for justice and equality for all justice marshall was selected as general counsel to the naacp legal defense fund in 1936 where for 25 years he traveled throughout the nation representing the interests of black citizens who were systematically denied their constitutional rights provided in the constitution itself thurgood marshall made it his life ambition to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination he fought hard to protect individual and minority rights one of marshalls most important victories occurred in 1954 when he successfully argued before the supreme court the school desegregation case brown v board of education the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal justice marshall also valiantly represented the black students vho sought to gain entry to central high school in little rock ar he also fought to protect the civil rights of many of the students who staged lunch counter sitins and integrated the southern bus lines in freedom rides justice marshalls fervent dedication to and belief in the constitution of the united states gained the attention of more than just a few then president john f kennedy appointed him to the unitedstates second circuit court of appeals in new york in 1961 four years later former president lyndon b johnson nominated him for the position of unitedstates solicitor general and on june 13 1967 thurgood marshall was catapulted to greater prominence by being nominated by president johnson to be the first black to serve on the supreme court through thurgood marshalls professional career he sought to enhance and secure equality in the personal lives of all americans his legacy is one for all to recognize and acknowledge marshall so aptly used our constitutional september 15 1993 c traditions to revive our democratic traditions it is today that we take great pride in rising to celebrate the contributions of the late supreme court justice thurgood marshall i would also like to acknowledge and welcome justice marshalls widow cecelia marshall as well as other members of the marshall family i join the congressional black caucus in celebrating the legacy of this prominent

thank my friend from new york for yielding the time the people of america should understand that this is the democrat budget it can all be summed up in just nine words tax tax tax spend spend spend borrow borrow borrow this bill is an insult to the american taxpayer it is an insult because the bill increases spending when the federal government is already 400 billion in the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going to increase the national debt under this bill things will only get worse it is an insult to the american people because the democrats in this house are raiding the social security reserves and other trust funds to the tune of 100 billion a year let me repeat that the trust funds in our country are being raided to the tune of 100 billion a year to cover the big spending that the democrats are pushing through this congress and under this bill social security will be raided even more yes social security is being taxed under this bill and the worst insult of all is that the democrats in this house want working families middleclass taxpayers and remember that tax cut they were promised americas senior citizens are going to pay even more taxes the american people should understand that under this bill the democrats will increase taxes on your social security benefits the democrats will tax social security and will tax social security benefits because the democrats in this house cannot control their big spending habits we republicans are opposed to taxing social security on february 10 the house republican study committee and the house republican research committee jointly held a congressional forum on the social security tax we revealed the damage that this bill will do to millions of senior citizens we detailed the unfairness of taxing benefits that average people earn through their lifetime of work just because the democrats in this house cannot say no to the special interest groups it is not only that they are spending money that upsets me it is that it is a payoff to the special interest groups yesterday i inserted in the congressional record the statebystate impact that this tax will have on senior citizens the democrats budget bill is an insult to the american people and it should be it must be rejected but if this budget passes the american people will know who is responsible for raising their taxes because the big spenders the democrats who control everything the house the senate the white house the bureaucracy all of the agencies are now marching on a new banner or i should say the same old banner tax tax tax spend spend spend borrow borrow borrow which is the battle cry of the

have decided to take this occasion to talk about the potential for bipartisan effort because i had so many different members of the house tell me that whatever side they were on last night on the nafta vote they thought it was really healthy it was a bipartisan debate and a bipartisan vote that there were democrats and republicans on both sides and they thought it was healthy for the country to have that kind of bipartisan effort in talking with a number of reporters today i was asked again and again does the fact that 138 republicans voted with 102 democrats to pass something in a genuinely bipartisan effort mean that there is a possibility for bipartisanship what struck me was that there are a lot of opportunities for bipartisanship my colleagues just heard a special order done by mr kasich of ohio a republican and mr penny of minnesota a democrat about the pennykasich proposal to cut spending which is a bipartisai effort put together by democrats and republicans working in a room trying to develop some real solutions and trying to do something which will help all americans i think it is possible to develop a series of bipartisan efforts in health care for example i know that there is a coopergrandy bill mr cooper of tennessee a democrat and mr grandy of iowa a republican have worked on a managed competition approach to health care and i am told that tomorrow there will be a rowlandbilirakis bill mr roland a democrat of georgia and mr bilmals a republican from florida who have been working on a commonsense bill that would bring together good ideas in a positive way so there are opportunities for bipartisanship and for putting together in a bipartisan way real reforms the question i have been asked of course all day is are there opportunities for the house republican leadership and for the house republicans to work with president clinton and with the clinton administration on good positive bipartisan efforts and it seems to me that there are in fact many opportunities for us to work together i would suggest that what we need to do in looking at next year as the president prepares his budget proposals and as he looks forward to the state of the union as he considers legislative opportunities is we need to recognize that we could work together to set an agenda for americans that would be very very powerful in a bipartisan way we could agree i think for example that if nafta the north american freetrade agreement goes through as apparently it will in the senate on saturday that we need a bill what i would call an economic growth after nafta a bill designed to create jobs to make american industry more competitive to give american workers more job security to create a better opportunity for american to compete both in the north american freetrade areas and in the world and i believe as people watch the president in seattle dealing with the asian nations and looking at trade in the pacific they will understand why we need an economic growth bill a job creation bill designed really to follow secretary bentsens advice to the japanese the secretary of the treasury said recently that the japanese need to cut spending and cut taxes and cut regulation and stimulate their economy and i think that is advice frankly that we should take here at home i believe it ought to be possible to develop a real welfare reform bill to require work as a condition of getting money from the government and i think that the work which has been done by congressman santorum and congressman shaw and congresswoman johnson and congressman gary franks of connecticut have put together a welfare reform bill which i think if the president could look at he would find would be in fact a very very useful beginning for a bipartisan effort to pass serious welfare reform to take a first step toward saving the inner city i think also that in the area of health i honestly believe that we in the house republican leadership and on the task force led by congressman bob mxchel our leader where we have worked for over 2 years to develop affordable health care now a bill which uses personal responsibility and market forces to improve the health of americans a bill which has medical savings accounts it has group insurance for small business it eliminates preconditions so every american can buy insurance it offers the same tax break for the selfemployed that large corporations get it is a bill which has malpractice reform to lower the cost of defensive medicine and which eliminates antitrust problems for hospitals so that they can work together to buy the best equipment and to cooperate in community health programs we believe that affordable health care now is a start but i believe further that if secretary bentsen were assigned the job of negotiating a health bill with his background on the senate finance committee that we could in fact draft a health bill which would pass the house and the senate and which would become law and which would have an overwhelming majority favoring it there is an opportunity for bipartisanship i also believe that on crime the country wants very strong measures taken particularly on violent crime congressman bill mccollum and congressman gerona gexas have been real leaders in developing the right kind of approach to look up violent criminals to build more prisons to provide longer sentences to have honesty in sentenoing to have an effective believable death penalty there are a number of steps we could take on crime that i think would have a bipartisan majority if the president would only help put it together i also think that it is possible for us to look at truly reinventing government the fact is we are going through an enormous information revolution we are going through a period of tremendous change in which it is possible to provide more goods and services at lower cost it is possible to use computers and information technology to use fiber optics and satellites that there are many many steps that can be taken to improve the quality of government without making it cost more but i believe that we have to face a central question here when i am asked is it possible to have bipartisanship my answer is yes if that bipartisanship is based on principles that are at the center of american life now what i mean by that is that if you go out and you ask the american people what they really believe in they are actually remarkably common sensible about 75 percent to 78 percent of all americans want a balanced budget in their government because they know they have to have a balanced budget in their business and their family about 77 percent of the american people believe in the death penalty as an effective deterrent for hardened criminals eightyone percent of southern blacks and 79 percent of southern whites favor a work requirement for welfare including for women with young children about 78 percent of all americans believe in voluntary school prayer and believe that beginning the day with a voluntary prayer is a good thing not a bad thing when you go through item after item after item the number of americans who believe that we should adopt much tougher laws on illegal aliens that we should stem the tide of illegal immigration an effort which in the house has been led by republicans such as congressman byron galleoly of california and congressman lamar smrrk of texas congressman hemy bonlla of texas and congressman bill mccollum of florida overwhelmingly americans believe americans of all backgrounds including first generation immigrants believe that while we should defend unprotected rights of legal immigration we should be much sterner and much tougher toward illegal aliens and we should be effective in protecting this countrys border from illegal immigration again and again we find this 75 percent 78 percent 80 percent 82 percent majority that consistently has a broad sense of values that would make sense and that i regard as the center of american policy in that framework if the president emphasized the new democrat part of his administration if he emphasized the reinventing part of his administration if he emphasized the part that emphasizes change i believe in that framework that it is possible for us to really make a difference but in order to understand the potential for that kind of bipartisan centrist effort to replace the welfare state by genuinely reforming things i think it is necessary to look at some of the steps that ought to be taken and i would simply suggest that until we are prepared to look at those steps nothing is going to happen let me mention an example of an area where there is i think tremendous bipartisan support for change but it is change which seems to be difficult to get in a congress in which trial lawyers have too much power we need malpractice reform we need liability reform today our legal system has become a tax on working americans every american pays a little more because we have a litigation system which is very destructive edwsars deming who fathered the quality movement and the man who taught the japanese a set of profound knowledge on quality asserted in his book out of the crisis that reforming our litigation system was one of the two most important steps we could take to improve the american economy the other was reforming health care now let me give some examples where a recent study of what the litigation tax and think of all of these extra government requirements for lawsuits as a tax a government required expenditure of your money and recently and i believe this was reprinted in one of the news magazines a study came out that looked at the litgation box here is what it found out if you go and buy an 8foot aluminum ladder and pay 119 in retail price the true cost of that ladder is 395 you are paying in effect a 24 litigation tax that is the manufacturer of the ladder the wholesaler who moved the ladder and the retailer who is selling you the ladder are paying between them 24 in insurance against the cost of liability lawsuits so you could buy the ladder for 95 but the american litigation system the liability lawsuits that you read about are costing you an additional 325 it gets to be bigger when you get to a heart pacemaker the current retail price for a heart pacemaker averages 18 000 the true cost is 315 000 the litigation tax is 3 000 that means that every person who is buying a pacemaker for their heart is paying 3 000 for the lawsuits the liability and malpractice litigation that is all too common in america a 2day maternity stay the retail price averages s3 s67 the true cost is 2 867 because there is a litigation tax an extra charge to make up for the cost of malpractice insurance of 300 just two more examples a tonsillectomy retail price is 578 the true cost is 387 the litigation tax is 191 a motorized wheelchair retail price is 1 000 true cost 830 litigation tax 170 let me go through and summarize again just so you understand how big the opportunity is to help the american economy by lowering the cost of goods making it easier to export and create jobs and lowering the cost to consumers i am going to repeat what we are paying in a litigation tax in malpractice insurance and litigation insurance and liability insurance and in lawsuits for the way we have a lawyerdominated political system and here is an area where i believe we could have bipartisan reform in trying to pass a malpractice and liability reform and we could put together a bipartisan coalition of republicans and democrats if only the clinton administration would work with us here are the tax numbers i mentioned an 8foot aluminum ladder you are paying a litigation tax of 24 for a heart pacemaker you are paying a litigation tax of 3 000 for a 2day maternity stay you are paying a litigation tax of 5500 and for a motorized wheelchair you are paying a litigation tax of 170 all of that could be changed dramatically with a bipartisan democrat and republican effort to bring together votes from both parties to pass real reform at the center let me give you a couple more examples a bipartisan opportunity that i think could help us i believe we could reshape our foreign service so it helps americans create local jobs through world sales i believe for example that we ought to introduce the idea and i am preparing legislation to have a special ambassador for exports to japan i think the japanese market is so big and the invisible barriers to trade are so great that we ought to have an ambassador whose only assignment is to work on trade with japan and i would like to see somebody like bob galvin the former leader of motorola one of the greatest export salesmen in the world someone who is a mature senior exporter who has practical experience in a large corporation selling in the japanese market become the special ambassador for exports whose only job would be to get up every day and to find new ways to sell american goods in japan creating american jobs here at home there will be a bipartisan initiative that i would hope we could pass on a joint republicandemocrat basis second i believe that we ought to design a new system where before a foreign service officer became an ambassador they were given a 1year sabbatical to work in an american export company that is for 1 year we would allow them and in fact require them to get to work learning what an export company is like what it is like to sell american goods around the world so that when they became an ambassador they would have had a practical commonsense real understanding of the world of sales because it is by selling goods around the world that we create jobs here in the united states i believe that would be something where we could in fact work together and where we could create the opportunity for americans to see the congress succeed as democrats and republicans work on a bipartisan basis to pass that kind of change my point is that there is a lot that can be done on a bipartisan basis last night did not have to be the only opportunity for us to work together but the democrats who have been in control of the house for 40 years and who now control the house the senate and the white house i think need to understand an old saying of a democratic president lyndon johnson used to say that if you wanted him to be in on the landing he wanted to be in on the takeoff what he meant by that is that he wanted to share in designing the plan not just voting for the plan he wanted a chance to have inputin how everything was put together not just have an input at the very end on whether to vote yes or no i believe that if the president would set up some bipartisan task forces that we could in fact have a number of bipartisan efforts that would get votes on both sides of the aisle republicans and democrats together to pass them i am very encouraged in that sense by a meeting that the gentleman from illinois the republican leader and i had recently with two senators senator kerrey of nebraska and senator danforth of missouri they have taken the lead in developing with president clintons help a bipartisan commission on entitlement reform this is a commission to look at the whole area of entitlements things which have been written into law so that people automatically are supposed to be getting and what they are going to try to do on a bipartisan basis is review all the ways the federal government automatically spends money on individual entitlements now there is a bipartisan opportunity which if we can pursue it together and if we can find some commonsense solutions at the center i think could be very effective i would hope that over the next few months the american people will see us working together on that area so let me just summarize i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on health i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on economic growth and job creation and after the passage of nafta i think it is more important than ever we do that i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on crime i believe we could have a bipartisan effort on illegal aliens i believe it is possible for us to work together on reinventing government to apply the principles of the information revolution and the contents of alvin tofflers third wave and edwards demings concepts of quality and profound knowledge to truly have a revolution in the cost and quality of government i believe it is possible for us to work together on a bipartisan basis to save the inner city i am prepared and i think the gentleman from illinois and the entire republican leadership is prepared to work to have a genuine bipartisan effort next year if that is the direction the clinton administration wants to go then it is important from the very beginning in planning next years budget in looking at next years legislative initiatives and developing the state of the union in a broad range of areas it is very important that we be bipartisan from the beginning it is very important that we work together i found frankly the last few weeks a very positive experience i found working with the clinton administration on the north american freetrade agreement to be a good thing i thought it was good for america to have democrats and republicans working in the same room trying to pass the same bill trying to get something done i think it would be tragic if the administration now felt that it had to move to the left that it had to become partisan and that it could not continue that tradition and so i wanted to take just a few minutes this evening to encourage my friends on the democratic side of the aisle to encourage the clinton administration to continue this experiment in bipartisan effort and i wanted to pledge on behalf of house republicans that we would like to work together to see if we could not cut spending increase the penalties against violent crime stop illegal aliens from coming into the united states pass a good health bill that would work and that would help americans and create jobs and economic growth so america can compete in the world market we are pledged that we will work in that kind of a bipartisan way if we can get cooperation from the democratic leadership and if the clinton administration is willing to continue this experience in bipartisan effort"], [5.448305728350533e-06, 5.448305728350533e-06, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for this special order tonight to discuss a very important issue that of our defense budget and our defense budget posture as i said before in our committee yesterday when we had secretary aspin and chairman colin powell in i have some grave concerns about where we are going and to follow up what my colleague from rhode island has stated about this being a bipartisan concern not only has senator sam nunn echoed his concerns in terms of the budget numbers and the process we are going through but our own chairman of our defense appropriations committee has as recently as this past week been quoted in the washington papers as saying i am beginning to see a hollow force developing again he is beginning to express his concerns and has said that in the out years it is going to be extremely difficult if not impossible to provide the budget cuts that the president is proposing and yet still keep up the missions that are being asked of our marines and other armed services around the world my first major concern deals with that this dollar amount was pulled out of the air in a direct question to secretary aspin yesterday i said mr secretary where did you get this number from was it based upon a threat assessment he said no was it based upon some staff work there in the pentagon he said no i said where did you get it from he said that it was based upon a number given to him by the office of management and budget and they got that by pulling it out of the air so we are in fact determining what the defense posture of this country will be not based upon reality and what in fact is out there in the real world and the hot spots that we know are there but we are basing it upon a budget number pulled out of the air that has now been told to us we have to fit the military into this configuration that is an extremely troubling situation to me my second concern deals with personnel cutbacks we are increasing the missions we are sending our troops to florida for hurricane andrew to the l a riots we have them over in somalia we are talking about sending them to bosnia yet we are cutting back the support that in fact will allow these troops to be put around the world as advocated by members of this body many of whom do not support the military in terms of their funding requirements i spoke yesterday in committee and mentioned that while i was in somalia 2 months ago we talked to some troops who told us that they had been deployed for three of the last four christmas holiday seasons they had been in desert storm they were on troop exercises in okinawa and they now found themselves in somalia they didnot even have the time to resupply their ships to provide the basic support materials necessary to complete the somalian operation we are stretching our troops to the limit in fact general mundy this morning in our hearing said the same thing we cannot keep asking our marines to do more with less money that is in fact where we are my third concern is morale you cannot ask the military to do all of these new assignments to be an allvolunteer force to transfer from base to base as we realign bases and then tell them on top of that that we are going to freeze their pay and that in fact we are going to reduce the amount of opportunities that they have to achieve higher levels of rank in the military this certainly is not putting people first my fourth concern is a very real one and that is economic impact the president has stressed repeatedly his need to create a stimulus package to create new jobs he has told us that this stimulus package that we in fact have passed in this body without my support would create 500 000 jobs the american people are smarter than that they understand that over 5 years we in fact will be causing one out of every two american defenserelated workers to lose their jobs now this is not my assessment in fact i would like to quote for the record two studies that i provided to my colleagues on the committee on armed services first of all the office of technology assessment came out with a report that said in fact that if we continue the cuts that we are currently planning for the next 5 years that we could see the amount of layoffs in defenserelated jobs lost total to 2 5 million men and women as a matter of fact in addition to that the congressional budget office has said in a document that they just recently released that up to 1 8 million men and women could lose their jobs this figure of 1 8 to 2 5 million is out of a total work force of 5 5 million american men and women who work in defenserelated jobs now here we are talking about eliminating perhaps an average of 2 million jobs while the president is talking about stimulating 500 000 new jobs i would say to my colleagues that we had better look carefully at this because these american men and women who are being outplaced not just ih the pentagon but from mcdonnell douglas from boeing from grumman have no place to go there are no jobs of equal pay with equal status that they can move into so this notion of retraining is a farce right now because our economy cannot sustain these kinds of massive cuts that gets into my fifth concern and that concern relates to what i think is on the part of the administration an oversimplification of defense conversion defense conversion is not going to happen by some stroke of lightning from this body or from the white house in terms of creating new jobs it is not going to happen by putting money into retraining if there are no jobs to retrain these people for it is not going to happen by trying to force companies like grumman and mcdonnell douglas into new industries we tried that back in the 1970s and many of those workers for those companies remember what happened they were not successful in that process conversion can work but it has got to be a slow and deliberate process and it certainly is not going to be dictated by anything we do legislatively here in this body but with all of these concerns that i have my no i concern out of the six concerns i have listed and the overriding concern that i think my colleagues here have is what is being talked about quietly in the halls of the congress what is being talked about by my colleagues on the democratic side as well as my colleagues on the republican side but it is a low level of discussion and that concern is the concern that what is being said about this president is that he just does not care about the men and women serving in our military i am not going to use my quotes i am going to use some quotes from a retired army colonel don snyder who now is a defense analyst for the center for strategic international studies in a recent article in the baltimore sun that ran nationwide he said more than 60 days into his administration he has not appointed the third person at the pentagon the military has some rude things to learn namely that this guy does not care about them what a tragic thing to have to deal with that the american men and women serving in our military in fact are seeing a growing concern in america that this president does not care about them and it is nothing that he can solve by giving words or by stopping at a ship to show concern and show caring he has got to involve himself in the problems and the concerns that these young people have so with all of the other things that are happening in terms of our defense budget the thing that troubles me the most is that fact and i think it is something that the president is going to have to deal with there have been numerous articles in the washington press and the national press about this president really having a problem in relating to the military he is the commander in chief and he deserves the respect of our armed forces but i would also say that our armed forces deserve the respect of the president and his entire administration that i think is my biggest concern and i know it is a concern which is shared by the gentleman in the well i thank the gentleman for yielding for this very important special order"], [1.0894393199123442e-05, 1.0894393199123442e-05, 0, "this afternoon the topic of my special order will be before we raise taxes i want to emphasize theopoint that before we raise taxes we need to examine carefully every aspect of government as my colleagues know this is a city washington where the objective need to raise taxes is almost overwhelning and every time we turn around somebody has a new reason why we need to raise taxes and they always talk in sort of casual terms we need 10 billion here 15 billion there a littie consumer tax wouldnt hurt anybody 20 billi6n 30 billion there i want to suggest that we are all forgetting because of the nature of government language that this is about real money involving real families and that it is a question to go back to president clintons inaugural address of who sacrifices first and it is fine to talk about sacrifice but somehow it always turns out to be the working american the taxpaying american the retired american who sacrifices and the government bureaucracy and the government employee unions and the trial lawyers who do better and better i would suggest that this is a real test of the family budget versus the government budget and which one is more important to those of us who have been elected now we talk about a billion dollars that dulls the senses because the truth is no family budget in america is at the billiondollar level even billionaires are only down in the 50 or 100 million a year level and for normal americans 100 is a lot of money a 1 000 is an enormous amount of money as my colleagues know at 1 000 we are talking about helping our child go through college at 1 000 we are saving up for a down payment on a house or a car at 1 000 we are talking about a lot of money for most americans and at 1 million we are talking about a thousand families talking about 1 000 and when we get to 1 billion we are talking about a million families with 1 000 each so it is very important to get these discussions down to real amounts for most people 5 is real 50 is real 100 is real but 1 billion is just government and so we sort of get numb it is almost like an anesthetic when we start talking about billions of dollars we sort of forget what is really involved the decisions we will make this spring on who sacrifices on whether we decide to change the government or to change the family budget on whether the real choices need to be made back home by working americans in their homes and their businesses or whether the real changes need to be made in washington by the bureaucracies and the welfare state these go to the core of where we are at i believe there are three very large very tough questions that need to be answered before we raise taxes we need to ask first are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking our american families for more money we need to ask second even if the system is efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do with their money and third we have to ask if we want to cut the deficit is raising taxes the right answer or will a tax increase so weaken the economy that it will kill jobs cripple revenues and increase the deficit all three of these questions i think need to be answered before we raise taxes now let me start with the question are we using the money we already have wisely enough to morally justify asking other americans to take money out of their families i just want to suggest that anybody who comes to washington and watches the federal bureaucracy for a couple of days will understand that we do not have the moral right to ask american families to tighten their belts to send the money to washington anybody who has watched the frugality of a small business that carefully monitors everything it is doing in order to stay in business or who watches the family that carefully saves pennies and decides whether or not they can afford to go to a movie and whether it has to be the twilight movie that is 3 50 rather than the evening movie at 7 understands that for most americans in tight times there are real decisions about saving even a few dollars and when you come to washington or any aspect of the federal government you can see that we are nowhere near the kind of frugality we need i recently last monday did a speech entitled renewing american civilization i talked about applying five pillars of freedom quality technological advance entrepreneurial free enterprise the principles of american civilization and psychological strength let me say that three of those quality as defined by edward demming the concept of profound knowledge technological advance using technology to do things better faster for less and entrepreneurial free enterprise using the basic principles of the free enterprise system those three pillars could dramatically lower the cost of the federal government imagine for example if president clinton were to invite 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 of the top corporate downsizers to the white house people who had downsized ford downsized ibm downsized xerox people who are in the process of downsizing sears roebuck and said to them if the key is to save money in bureaucracy and if modern computers and modern information systems allow us to save money in bureaucracy what have you learned by doing it to a bureaucracy of a hundred thousand that i can now apply to a bureaucracy of 2 million what would the department of agriculture or the department of labor look like or the department of health and human services look like if we applied the same downsizing principles for that matter what will the pentagon look like if we require it to go through the same quality transformation that say the ford motor co or xerox has gone through what we know is we would have a lot fewer bureaucrats and a lot fewer offices shuffling a lot fewer papers what we know is we would be dramatically less expensive and we would be in a position to talk seriously about how much less the federal government would cost let me also suggest that when you look at what we are subsidizing in waste waste in education in places like the new york city school bureaucracy or the washington dc school bureaucracy waste in the unionized work rules of philadelphia and detroit and new york the kind of institutionalized waste of money it makes no sense there was one report last year that in philadelphia the union work rules literally required three people at the philadelphia airport to change a ltghtbulb because one person had to come and take the various lighting fixtures off a second person had to come to change the bulb and a third person had to come to sweep around the area after the first person put the light fixtures back on now we cannot afford that kind of waste in government i recently talked here about the problem of the new york city custodians who are given a brandnew jeep every 5 years by the school board and if they do not use the jeep at the end of 5 years they get to take it home as a personal vehicle and then they get a new jeep so all the alternatives in the new york city system are for nonuse of the jeep so it can become a personal vehicle with minimum miles on it and minimum waste and there was the recent custodian for the public schools in new york city who was indicted because he was sitting on his yacht when he was collecting money for supposedly cleaning up the school my point is that there is a tremendous amount of reform in local state and federal government that is needed before we raise a penny in taxes let me go a step further and suggest that precisely what made americas biggest corporations inefficient and ultimately economically insecure was their unwillingness to go through dramatic change general motors would be a healthier company today if over the last 10 or 15 years it had gone through change and sears and roebuck would be a more competitive company today if over the last 10 to 15 years it had gone through dramatic change now we see the private market forcing change at that level we see what is happening to these corporations in order to stay alive they have got to become leaner more competitive and more customer oriented yet what do we hear from the government not any talk about dramatic bold change not any talk about dramatic management reforms not any talk about downsizing the bureaucracy instead what the government says is that we really cannot change anything except in your pocketbook we cannot threaten any of the public employee unions we cannot talk about changing any of the bureaucracies we cannot think about changing the civil service laws or the personnel laws or the procurement laws all we can think about is getting more money out of working americans but before we raise taxes i think we owe it to the american people to apply the same management toughness to government that we are seeing applied throughout the private sector there is a second question we need to ask before we raise taxes even if the system is efficient and i do not believe it is or even if we went through that process of making it efficient are we in fact doing what the american people want us to do there is a very simple test of this which congressman bob walker of pennsylvania has put in the record it is a bill that would allow all taxpayers to set 10 percent of their tax aside to go directly to the debt they could set aside anything from 0 up to 10 percent let us say you paid 3 000 in federal taxes under the walker proposal you could designate anything from 0 up to 300 to go to the federal debt and the congress would receive an instruction to lower federal spending by the same number of dollars the congressional budget office suggested that congressman walkers bill would probably balance the budget within 5 years based on public opinion polls of how many people would be using the 10 percent deficitcutting mechanism but notice what it says it says that you do not have to pay for any more government that you think is wasteful or that you think is not useful it says that you could make decisions to force the congress to cut the size of the aggregate federal government i think that is a very useful idea and a better idea than raising taxes so one of the things we ought to look at is before we get around to tax increases before we raise taxes passing congressman walkers 10percent deficit setaside to allow the american people to vote by their pocketbooks on how much of their taxes up to 10 percent could go to reducing the deficit and forcing the government to set priorities let me carry it a step further what if we were to set priorities what if we were to say to the american people here are the 30 least important bureaucracies in washington could we close them down what if we were to say here are the 20 least important programs not that they are not good programs if you have a milliondollarayear income it is amazing what you can do that you would not do if you have a 20 000ayear income you do not need as many priorities and you would not have to make nearly as many tough decisions at a million dollars a year what we have in washington is a congress and a government which has an openended idea about how much they want to spend but has a fairly limited actual amount of revenue coming in and the deficit is the gap between our unwillingness to set priorities and the size of the real revenue if we were to actually test the system here is what we would find out eightyone percent of the american people want us to replace welfare with workfare it is an astonishing number eightyone percent of the people agree that we need to require people to work if they get money that by the way would dramaticallyohange the cost of welfare yet we are hearing talk that we ought to raise taxes on working americans to subsidize the welfare system and take care of people who are not working that is something 81 percent of the people object to seventyfive percent of the american people believe we ought to have malpractice reform and tort reform so we would have fewer lawsuits and fewer gigantic settlements and so we would have less litigation that would save more than 5 billion and the estimates go on up to 30 billion or 40 billion a year it would save money oa defensive medicine it would save money in lawsuit costs it would save money in court costs and it would save money across the board in terms of not having to pay professionals to do extra things just to be prepared to defend ourselves we ought to pass malpractice and tort reform before we talk about raising taxes then we come to an area where people do not want change and yet it is one of the areas that the democratic administration is talking about changing i am fascinated by this this is a wire story which was brought to my attention just a few minutes ago it talks about president clintons economic aides and i want to share this with my colleagues this is an associated press story in the first word of what clintons longdiscussed proposal will look like clintons aides said the presidents package would consist of 16 billion in immediate spending increases for fiscal 1993 which runs through sept 30 in addition the package will contain 15 billion worth of investment tax credits a tax break given businesses that invest in equipment there is no word in that story about any offsets this is a 31 billion increase in the deficit we remember that ross perot ran promising to cut the deficit and bill clinton ran promising to cut the deficit he was going to cut the deficit in half in his first 4 years the first proposal we are now hearing is a 31 billion increase in the deficit if my memory serves me that is around a 9percent increase on the current total deficit projection so we are going to actually increase the deficit on the way to decreasing the deficit does that not sound like something we have all lived through before where the politicians promise anything to get elected and then rapidly begin to figure how they are not going to do any of the things they promised we notice also that the new term in washington is investment investment has replaced pork barrel it is a good washington word and people who love big government and love the welfare state believe if they run around chanting investment long enough people will not notice that investment is just a new word for spending the article goes on to say thisand i am quoting from the associated press story that came over the wire a few minutes agothe administration officials spoke of a raft of upperincome taxes that arwe under consideration the official said in addition panetta spoke of the need for a shared burden in deficit reduction the off icial said although he did not specify what he meant the former house budget committee chairman has been an advocate of finding savings in the social security program panetta has been a supporter of one proposal under consideration the elimination of next years costofliving increase for the nations 41 million social security recipients the article goes on to say this also under consideration is a plan cc tncrease the amount of taxes social security recipients would have to pay on their benefits many senate democrats prefer that alternative since only the v4 bestoff retirees pay any taxes at all now notice this what are they talking about here when they talk about the concept of shared burden in deficit reduction now this is the democratic office of management and budget the director of the budget shared burden does not mean cutting the size of government notice this is an article saying they are going to increase the size of government by 16 billion so the bureaucracy the politicians the pork barrel recipients they are not going to suffer any shared burden shared burden according to this article is going to mean people on social security paying more taxes or alternatively people on social security having to give up part of their costofliving increase or even the elimination according to this consideration of the elimination of rext years costofliving increase now let me point out the one government program people actually seem to like is social security it is the one program where grandchildren seem to think it is reasonable to pay to help their grandparents grandparents are grateful they are getting money parents are glad that they are in a situation to help their own parents who are now retired and there is a social contract which is very deeply held this is the one program also by the way which has a very tiny bureaucracy we send out more social security checks with fewer civil servants than almost any other program in the government so which program do our friends in the democratic administration want to hit social security notice also to receive social security you actually were working you were actually putting money away you were actually paying the social security tax so once again who is going to get it in the wallet it is the working american in this case it is the retired version of working americans meanwhile is government going to get smaller no according to this article the very first step that the clinton administration wants to take is to increase the size of government by 316 billion exactly the wrong step here wehave not even the usual fig leaf let us vote for a tax increase and we will have smaller government because we will cut spending by the way that fig leaf is never kept the average over the last 20 years is that for every dollar of tax increase there is a 1 58 increase in spending but that is not the key here the key here is that you have an administration which is saying let us raise spending and raise taxes now what does that mean that means less money for retirees it wreans less money in social security it means less money in the private sector it means less money for families but it means a lot more money for bureaucrats a lot more money for politicians to give away as pork barrel and a lot more money for the public employee unions to be able to organize people now i think that it is very important for the american people to understand up front exactly what is at stake here this is the first shot in what is going to be a 4year process of the democrats attempting to raise taxes on working americans and retired americans to transfer the money to politicians and bureaucrats to have a larger welfare state and a bigger welfare system it is explicitly wrong and as long as the welfare state keeps growing i think we have an absolute obligation to fight any tax increase so before we raise taxes let us overhaul the entire welfare state let me go to the third question even if we were doing the right things and we were doing them efficiently would we want to cut the deficit by raising taxes or will tax increases so weaken the economy that in fact a recession will come on jobs will be killed revenues will go down and the deficit instead of decreasing will increase now notice everywhere around the world we are telling people who are trying to make a transition from big centralized governments that they ought to decentralize we are telling boris yeltsin in russia we are telling menem in argentina salinas in mexico privatize parts of your government shrink your bureaucracy go back to the free market go back to private property and yet here in washington we have all too many people in the democratic administration who are talking about bigger government bigger bureaucracy mora programs and higher taxes i believe that that will in fact kill the current recovery and put us back in a recession it might take 1 or 2 years but it will happen it will happen first because as they increase the size of government you are going to see interest rates go back up and you are going to see the inflation rate go back up i am now prepared to predict having watched for a couple of weeks we are now very very close to the low point for both inflation and interest rates we are at a 20year low it has taken us 12 years to recover from carters inflation it took a tremendous amount of pain both in the recession of 198182 and in the recession of 199091 but finally we are at the lowest interest rates for home mortgages the lowest longterm unitedstates bond rates and the lowest inflation rate we have seen in 20 years the result we now have liberal democrats promptly promising bigger spending bigger government higher taxes which will lead to more inflation and higher interest rates and i will be very prepared a year from now or 2 years from now to come back here to the house floor and defend that projection and look at what inflation and interest rates look like at that point i feel some confidence in talking about the economy because on august 22 1990 1 spoke at the heritage foundation on a speech entitled the was ington establishment versus the american people a report from the budget i want to take page 9 of that particular speech and share with people what i said in 1990 because i think we are right back in the same situation economic dangers i believe that we have to then take this analysts and look at a very real danger which can cause all of us enormous pain and that is a recession the world that existed at the beginning of the budget summit is over i went on to talk about the seizure of kuwait and what is happening in iraq we have the fact absolute fact in my judgment that the economy is clearly weaker today than it was a year ago and i want to make a point that is not made often enough in this city a recession is the worst enemy of a balanced budget if we have a recession and we have millions of americans put out of work the net effect of not paying taxes because you dont have a job and increasing unemployment and welfare because you need it will be to dramatically widen the budget deficit but there is a second hidden whammy now and that is the cost of the savings and loan bailout the government is now the largest seller of property in america therefore it has a greater interest than any other person or group in keeping property values up because if property values crash the cost of liquidating the properties goes up astronomically avoiding a recession now given those two objective realities and combining with them a caring humanitarian view that argues that a job is the best welfare program the number one goal on september 5th when the congress returns should be to adopt a proposal which will avoid a recession and for the life of me i cannot see how any member of congress or any member of the government could argue for anything else in terms of domestic policy we must be strong in the middle east and we must be strong in the american economy i believe we should have a tax cut package because we know what doesnt work and we know what does work in the 1970s we tried raising taxes going into a recessionthis was the famous hoovercarter policy and it didnt work in the early thirties didnt work in the seventies turns out when you raise taxes going into a recession you get a depression if youre unlucky and you get a very deep recession if youre lucky we also tried a different technique in the eighties called lowering taxes lowering taxes seemed to have a better effect than raising taxes now i am not an economist or a political scientist so i dont have any kind of linear projection here but as a historian i am willing to suggest that we would rather be like the eighties than the seventies now this is in washington by the way a very radical statement im serious large parts of washington want to raise tayes precisely to repudiate the eighties this is an act of purification and liberal democrats want to be able to go home and say you see we have finally done away with all the wicked things that ronald reagan did and now youll be safe and theyll say this to very long unemployment lines let me make the point that i said this on august 22 1990 and we were discussing at that time a situation in which we were in a budget summit and all the establishment figures of washington were saying raise taxes raise taxes as we all know president bush tragically gave in we raised taxes and what was the result it was exactly what i said in august 1090 recession was deeper the unemployment was longer the deficit grew bigger government revenues declined fewer people were at work they paid fewer taxes the result was the government had less money and the net result was a bigger debt and a worse economic situation sadly the final result was the defeat of president bush who finally looked back in august 1992 and said in houston at the republican convention that in fact it had been a great mistake to raise taxes in 1990 well let me just suggest to you that this is still a great mistake this economy is much weaker than its macro numbers when you see general motors talking about laying off thousands of people when you see sears talking about laying off thousands of people when you see ibm talking about laying off thousands of people when you see additional burdens being put on small business the fact is objectively we are a very fragile economy the german economy is in trouble the japanese economy is in trouble if we have one or two unexpected shocks we are going to go back into a recession now we have a very painful very hard bought gradual slow recovery under way and any effort to increase the deficit with bigger government spending is going to raise interest rates and that is going to weaken the economy and any effort to raise taxes is going to weaken the private sector and that is going to weaken the economy and the result is going to be more people out of work yet the fact is that in washington those obvious common sense historic lessons do not seem to get through to people i made that point on page 12 in the 1990 heritage speech when i said washington against america and we need to look at this city as a city which is almost totally out of touch with the american people today a city which has rejected every presidential election since 1968 in both parties they rejected the republicans and they rejected jimmy carter and then they rejcted more republicans this is a city which is proud that it has withstood all the screams of the american people for lower taxes less government and a replacement for the welfare state i think i could say that paragraph today and include bill clinton as well as jimmy carter what did we have last fall we had a presidential campaign in which a thirdparty candidate one of the most powerful of the 20th century campaigned against the deficit said we had to cut spending in washington we had to cut the deficit and what do we see we see the very first clinton socalled stimilus package giving the politicians and the bureaucrats 16 billion in bigger deficit because they are going to spend 16 billion more in washington we have as i said in 1990 a rejection of lower taxes by the washington power structure which wants higher taxes a rejection of lees government by the washington power structure which wants more government and a rejection of the concept of replacing the welfare state where workfare is supported by 81 percent of the american people by liberal democrats who in fact favor the welfare state now in that framework let me suggest that there is a book which has been a best seller which is worth looking at by folks by harry figgle jr with gerald swanson called bankruptcy 1995 the coming collapse of america and how to stop it this is a very powerful book which talks about deficits it is a book which talks about the need to cut spending and the need to cut the deficit i want to share with you a couple of key points that mr figgle and dr swanson make in their book this is a current best seller he talks about the budget reconciliation act of 1990 this lethe act which was passed against my opposition after the speech i made at heritage in august it was a deal made in october by the power structure of the city of washington to prop up the welfare state by raising taxes on the american people this from pages 59 to 61 is what mr figgie says"], [2.1918094716966152e-05, 2.1918094716966152e-05, 0, "yesterday president clinton complained on national tv that he couldnt get flood relief passed because the

bill on to our children it is no excuse to say we have done this before when you are 4 trillion in debt it is time to do something different yet the majority of democrats in this house are so addicted

compromise and how reasonable it is i just want to reemphasize that the local government all the affected local governments are strongly opposed to this bill i havebefore me a letter dated september 21 1994 from the county of humboldt in that letter it indicates that our reasons for opposition remain the same loss of productive timber land to the degree indicated in h r 2866 means loss of tax revenue to the county and local schools increased unemployment in a county with already high unemployment levels social and personal family disruption our board has supported the concept of a 4 500 acre headwaters forest proposal but remain adamantly opposed to the hamburg proposal of 44 000 acres signed stan dixon first district supervisor it indicates in the letter that they opposed this by a fourtoone vote of the board of supervisors i think the point needs to be made that the land in this 44 000 acres is already zoned for timber production under the humboldt county land use guidelines furthermore the point needs to be made that 90 percent of the property in this 44 000 acres has already been harvested at least once and in some instances twice so they have gone through it they have cut the trees once they have grown back they have cut them again and they have grown so let us not delude ourselves into thinking that we are protecting ancient redwoods in all of these 44 00 acres it just is not true the headwaters forest itself is about 3 900 acres in order to go the extra 10 miles in my opinion and provide buffer around that they threw in approximately an extra 600 acres just to make sure that everything would be nice and the county the maxxam has said they would be willing to entertain the idea of transferring the 3 900 acres of old growth redwoods with the 600 acre buffer for a total of approximately 4 500 acres they would be willing to sell that at market value to the unitedstates government that is something that would allow logging to go on in humboldt county this is the largest county in the first congressional district the people of that district are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill when we speak of old growth redwoods i think it is worth noting all of these red areas here show where we have protected timber lands and it is 265 000 acres of protected redwoods in the state of california the federal government presently owns 46 percent of our state not counting the california desert bill and not counting this bill 46 percent of the state of this 265 000 acres of protecter redwoods 91 000some acres are old growth redwoods already how much more public land do we have to have how can we hear impassioned speeches from the president and from members of this congress about getting the deficit under control and asking us to sacrifice by hiking our taxes and then come before us with proposals like this which are going to be proposing to spend money we do not have to buy land we do not need in order to eliminate jobs that presently exist i find it unbelievable that a com promise can be talked about when the men and women whowork in the forests who depend upon those jobs have not even been brought into the equation the two timber unions are strongly opposed to this particular bill because they will not have any jobs it is a jobkilling measure it is wrong for that reason to enact this legislation this is a bad bill and i would like just to urge all of the members please vote no on this bill if we want to talk about preserving ancient redwoods then maybe we can talk if you would have allowed the amendment which i sought to offer before the committee on rules i was denied that permission yesterday i was denied permission by adopting the previous question today we would have reduced the acreage to the 4 500 acres why should the taxpayers pay 1 5 billion we have a 4 5 trillion debt how much more public land do we need in the state of california we cannot manage what we have maxxam has been referred to have been a party to a compromise it does not include the men and women who work who are strongly and unitedly opposed to this particular bill maxxam bought pacific lumber co i think it was 1986 they bought it and all of its assets all of its land its capital assets et cetera for 900 million a proximately now we have a bill that basically proposes to spend 1 5 billion to buy 4 400 acres maxxam maybe thinks that is not

occasions when i would like to strangle some of my colleagues i have never wanted to strangle an airport the fact is that under the funding levels of this bill approximately 70 percent of faas discre tionary funds will be set aside for existing letters of intent because of the rapid growth of letters of intent in past years the faa has very little discretion funding left this congress has even less because what happens is that there is a tendency on the part of the executive for the purpose of their own reelection campaign to go out and grant letters of intent to key areas of the country on the election campaign trail to promise them some kind of permanent victory in the future what letters of intent do is bind future administrations they bind future congresses they give us less discretion those who are con cerned about the budget deficit sai that one of the reforms we ought to have in the congress is to have more discretion here in making funding decisions we have made entitlements of so many programs and many of them are out of control letters of intent amount to nothing more than casebycase entitlements we are seeking to curb them we do nothing to affect existing letters of intent in the pipeline we are going to have tolive with them we are going to have to live with those decisions of prior faa administrators for whatever reason but what we are trying to do is return more discretion to the faa and the congress so that some of the smaller airports that do not have lobbying clout at the faa that cannot press their case for an loi might have a better chance at getting some of these funds if we allow new lois to be added to those already in effect the entire program is basically put on autopilot with no flexibility for the faa to award grants based on changing needs this may be good for a few airports that get their funding looked in with in loi but it is really bad for the majority for the great majority of airports in the country which would find the well dry when their needs need to be addressed this provision allows the adminstra tion and the faa more discretion in their ability to award airport grants where they are needed on an annual basis and not simply because somebody somewhere issued a letter of intent for something i have heard the question raised that since the faa is not required to sign letters of intent today why should we prohibit them from signing new ones the reality is that there is great pressure on the faa to sign these inultiyear lettersofintent agreements perhaps they have not been as firm as they could have been in saying no to airports i know how difficult it is to say no to people believe you me after this year i know that but saying yes too many times to too many airports has led the faa to the problem that we have today now we have heard the statement of loi supporters that these agreements save money i can tell you that i have seen no evidence and we have asked this question we have seen no evidence that lois can save the federal government money even though the procedure has been in place since 1987 if significant savings exist i am certain that we would have heard about them by now i am also sure that the faa would have documented these savings but they have said nothing i have also heard the argument that since these projects are eligible for funding we should allow them to be funded on a multiyear basis without having to wait for future appropriations that the projects would be delayed if we waited for annual appropriations this is very dangerous thinking there is virtually an unlimited number of projects good projects around the country which could be funded if we did not have to worry about the annual budget constraints or the budget deficit or lois we could

continue past operations we believe that only 21 provisions of the 135 are new that have been proposed by the committee and could be considered in any way as real legislative amendments most of those 21 make very minor or technical changes in the law the eight that are more significant are as follows just so members know what the complaints are about and what we protected so members do not think that members of the committee on appropriations have some special privilege of sneaking their own individual amendments into this bill one would allow for both white collar and blue collar pay raises the second would require a report on internal revenue service tax system modernization the third would require a report from the drug czar a fourth would make funds available for construction projects not authorized by law the fifth would require new courthouse projects to meet certain standards the sixth would allow agencies to finance recycling through the sale of recycled materials the seventh would provide leave for federal employees donating bone marrow or organs the eighth would require reductions in staff when implementing buyout legislation those are the eight major ones and not all those are major of the 21 new the vast majority of the 135 that people keep alluding to fall into 2 other categories one agencies without authorization which the gentleman from iowa quite properly alluded to and the second are socalled good government provisions the agencie s without authorization which need to be protected under the bill and which the gentleman from iowa was urging protection

board office of government ethics and administrative conference of the united states finally the socalled good government provisions which would permit agencies to use funds to operate and maintain buildings purchase improvements automobiles equipment and provide awards require reports on controversial spending items and allow transfers among accounts those are the 135 to the best of the

the points of light program those are all folded in as well as the civilian community corps authorized in 1990 virtually every service program within our jurisdiction is folded into the corporation

should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period middleclass families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middleclass families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directiy to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in

to continue to make needed strides in medical and scientific advances at the same time i am confident that this legislation will not have undue consequences on industries vital to our economy such as the chemical industry the legislation is intended to solve existing problems not to cause new ones for industries that have functioned smoothly within the current system i congratulate congressman bill hughes chairman of the subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial administration and congressman carlos moorhead the ranking subcommittee member for their steadfast dedication to this issue the proposal before the house today reflects years of work on this issue with regard to the copyright provisions of this bill they are the same as were passed on november 20 1993 when the house adopted h r 897 by voice vote these provisions are designed to bring needed reforms to the copyright office registration process by removing bureaucratic obstacles to the protection and enforcement of copyrights h9284 again congressmen hughes and moorhead are to be particularly conmended for their fine work as leaders in the copyright field this package deserves the support of the house of representatives and i urge my colleagues to vote aye"], [0.010849833488464355, 0.48915016651153564, 1, "and the distinguished ranking member mrs meyers as well as their staffs for their willingness to work with me on this amendment i know they share my desire to improve the enforcement of child support and i appreciate their efforts i would further extend my appreciation and commendations to my l a todd tuten i said to him todd find some way in which we might be able to address this very abysmal picture regarding child support in this country he came upon this method and worked with the staffs of the committee and we were able to come up with this amendment my amendment is not designed to address the fundamental flaws in our nations child support enforcement system rather it is intended to send a clear messagethat paying child support is a fundamental civic responsibility parents who neglect that obligation simply transfer the costs to the rest of society and they should not be rewarded for such action my staff and i have worked carefully to draft language which will achieve this policy objective without being excessively broad in scope we want to ensure that the amendment will not exclude individuals who should rightfully receive assistance and that it will not impose any hardship on the small business administration in that regard the small business administration has informed me that the amendment would not impose a significant administrative burden on the agency briefly the amendment would require applicants for financial assistance to certify that they are not in violation of the terms of any administrative order court order or repayment agreement under which the applicant is required to pay child support applicants will only be required to sign an affirmative statementthey will not be asked to present documentation from the court or administrative body this requirement would be enforced through an existing provision of the small business act which establishes penalties for fraud in obtaining financial assistance my amendment will prevent the use of taxpayers dollars to assist those who refuse to satisfy their most basic parental obligationproviding ade quate support for their child however my primary intent is to encourage payment of child support in that respect the amendment can be likened to a carrot and stick approach by denying assistance only to those individuals who are currently in violation of an order or repayment agreement the amendment provides an incentive for noncustodial parents to pay their pastdue child support once the terms of the order or repayment agreement are met the individual is no longer precluded from applying for such assistance failure to pay child support is not merely being late or forgetful of ones obligations it is a violation of a lawful court order it may also be considered contempt of court thus it is not unreasonable to require applicants for sba assistance to comply with their legal duties i believe we must also look to the end result of failure to pay support a lack of financial assistance designed to ensure the health and wellbeing of children who are by definition innocent victims of the delinquency in conclusion my amendment is designed to send a simple messagethat we as a society place a high value on the health and wellbeing of our children i remain willing to work with my colleagues on any necessary refinements to the language of this proposal and i urge members to support this important amendment i reserve the balance of my time"],
