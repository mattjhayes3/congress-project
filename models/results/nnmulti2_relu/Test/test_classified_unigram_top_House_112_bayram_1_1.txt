he is at least the 11th land claims victims rights or displaced persons leader to have been killed in colombia so far this year displaced persons and victims rights advocates in the sucre region received a series of death threats during the month of june we dont know yet whether mendozas killing is related to these threats but i traveled to sucre in 2003 and can attest to the daily violence suffered by local leaders and displaced persons and campesino organizations on june 7 anna fabricia cordoba 51 a leader of the displaced and a land rights activist was shot dead by an unidentified gunman while riding on a bus in medellin she had fled her home in northern antioquia in 2001 after several of her family members were killed she had been campaigning for the restitution of lands to

against colombian human rights defenders the situation is getting worse every day i receive news about threats murders and disappearances of colombian labor and human rights activists and community leaders i recite this sad litany of recent murders to impress upon my colleagues that these are real people real leaders being murdered every single day in colombia will their murderers be brought to justice or will their deaths be just one more case that remains in impunity will the governments promises to their families to seek justice be fulfilled will other threatened leaders and their families receive real protection i hope so but we simply dont know yet promises are easy results take time commitment and political will to achieve this morning some of my colleagues will describe the dangers facing colombias labor activists colombia still remains the most dangerous place in the world to be a unionist but violence against colombias workers happens in the context of a very threatening landscape for anyone who has the courage to organize their communities run for public office or stand up for the rights of the poor the displaced and the victims of human rights abuse the source of violence are all the illegal armed actors the farc the eln the paramilitaries and criminal networks known as bacrim and also sadly it includes members and units of the colombian military and police before any trade agreement is brought to the congress for a vote we owe it to the brave people of colombia to give the santos administration time to demonstrate that it can carry out the historic reforms that it has announced as its priorities we need time to see if the initial steps required by the unitedstates colombia labor action plan actually result in changes on the ground inside colombia will workers be able to exercise their rights organize freely and bargain directly with their employers without the fear of death and we need time to determine whether violence against rights defenders and community leaders is actually reduced under the leadership of president santos and whether greater protections are provided and prove to be effective we need to see and we should demand to see results on the ground before congress takes up the free trade agreement lets use whatever leverage the unitedstates has in colombia to help end a culture of impunity and violence that by any standard is intolerable i cannot approve an fta on the basis of good intentions it must be based on results in conclusion let me just say trade agreements should be about lifting people up not keeping them down"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "almost one in four homeowners in our country is underwater meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth and all of this misery is due to wall

america can remain a leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and billionaires and bringing our troops home from afghanistan my friends on the other side of aisle want to cut medicare medicaid and social security benefits for those americans who need them i urge my

holiday season congress has chances a couple of chances right in front of them to do whats right for the american people and to side with the overwhelming percentage of americans suffering out there in this economy for an entire year the majority in the house has not offered a single bill to create a single job in fact the only thing that the congress has been doing is creating an environment where public sector jobs are cut and where private sector jobs though they have been growing are offset by those public sector cuts leaving us with an unemployment rate which were happy to have at 8 6 percent but within the historical context is still a national disgrace and an outrage to have unemployment at 8 6 percent for so very long but were happy to have it because it has been as high as 10 and now were threatening to leave more than 2 million americans including 13 000 in my home state of minnesota out in the cold during the holiday season by taking away their unemployment insurance right now 14 million people are unemployed and companies really arent hiring for most of these people unemployment insurance is the only thing thats keeping them in their homes and not out on the street according to the census bureau unemployment insurance has pulled 3 2 million americans out of poverty last year and thats why congress needs to make sure that all americans continue to have this vital lifeline available any credible economist will tell you that unemployment insurance creates jobs every dollar invested in unemployment insurance yields a return of 1 52 in economic growth at least 200 000 jobs would be lost if congress fails to pass the extension of unemployment insurance benefits congress must not leave washington for the holidays without extending unemployment

congress is going to be undermined by virtue of what he is proposing i rise in opposition to the rule which provides for consideration of a resolution to reduce what is being called nonsecurity spending to 2008 levels that resolution h res 38 sends a very damaging message that the congress will not stand up to protect those programs that are absolutely essential to jobs and the economy it also rejects a key principle that military leaders and presidents of both parties have clearly recognized foreign assistance and diplomacy are essential to united states national security that principle has been honored on a bipartisan basis ever since the tragic events of september 11 2001 on that terrible morning americans woke to the realization that while the cold war was over their safety and security could be threatened by much less sophisticated means the ideologies and the weapons of terror could not be thwarted by military power alone in 2004 the republicancontrolled congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act by a vote of 33675 it was supported by all the members who are now in positions of leadership in this body the speaker the majority leader and the budget committee chairman all voted for it the bill now public law 108458 states longterm success in the war on terrorism demands the use of all elements of national power including diplomacy military action intelligence covert action law enforcement economic policy foreign aid public diplomacy and homeland defense it continues to win the war on terrorism the united states must assign to economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority that is assigned to military capabilities in fact the portion of the bill that makes these findings is known as the 9 11 commission implementation act of 2004 it states the legislative and executive branches of the government of the united states must commit to robust longterm investments in all of the tools necessary for the foreign policy of the united states to successfully accomplish the goals of the united states all of the tools necessarythat includes diplomacy and foreign assistance which would be slashed under this resolution the 9 11 commission implementation act of 2004 goes on to say that these investments will require increased funding to united states foreign affairs programs in may of this year admiral mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff wrote to thenspeaker pelosi regarding proposed cuts to the international affairs budget the opening paragraph stated we are living in times that require an integrated national security program with budgets that fund the full spectrum of national security efforts including vitally important preconflict and postconflict civilian stabilization programs he was reinforcing a message that had also been communicated on several occasions by secretary gates when he wrote the diplomatic and developmental capabilities of the united states have a direct bearing on our ability to shape threats and reduce the need for military action it is my firm belief that diplomatic programs as part of a coordinated strategy will save money by reducing the likelihood of active military conflict involving unitedstates forces admiral mullen penned a personal note at the end which read the more significant the cuts the longer military operations will take and the more and more lives are at risk president bush when sending up his wartime supplemental request in fy 2006 integrated diplomatic and military spending he asked congress to provide the resources to win the war on terror the message from our military leadership this congress and even former president bush is clear unitedstates civilian agencies must be fully resourced to prosecute the fight against terror effectively a cut to the 150 budget harms unitedstates national security and puts american lives at risk and yet the chairman of the rules committee explained during consideration of this resolution that security spending does not include diplomacy and development he said no my definition my definition is as we have outlined in here this is discretionary spending other than defense military construction v a and homeland security the resolution itself does not define what is security or nonsecurity but the authors say they do not consider diplomacy and development part of our national security budget before voting on this resolution i would urge my colleagues to think about what the practical implications would be of major cuts in the international affairs budget in 2008 the vast majority of unitedstates assistance to iraq was provided by the military this year at long last we are withdrawing the remainder of our troops and handing over the job to civilians if we cut our diplomatic and development budget for iraq then all the investments weve made and all the american lives that have been lost will be in vain the civilian presence costs only a tiny fraction of what we were spending on the military but this resolution would make that civilian presence impossible the proposed cuts will mean snatching defeat from the jaws of victory returning to the past would also mean violating our memorandum of understanding with israel under which we pledge to help israel maintain its qualitative military edge against those who seek its destruction do my colleagues suggest we renege on our commitment to israel in afghanistan and pakistan we cannot defeat violent extremism by military power alone as secretary gates recently said without development we will not be able to be successful in either iraq or afghanistan our military strategy in afghanistan is often described as clear hold and build how can we succeed if there is no one to do the holding and the building foreign assistance programs protect us even outside the areas of active combat or potential conflict our efforts to stop the spread of hiv aids and other deadly diseases counter the flow of illegal narcotics prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction reduce human misery and halt environmental destruction all help to protect the safety and security of american citizens we cant afford to go back to the isolationist unilateralist policies of the past cutting spending to 2008 levels takes us back to a period when americas standing in the world was at an alltime low whether its finding new markets for unitedstates goods and services addressing climate change sharing the burden of peacekeeping enforcing sanctions against iran or improving travel and communications we need to build strong international relationships we all remember the period when the united states tried to go it alone unwilling to cooperate with other countries and demonstrate global leadership weve finally begun to turn that all around lets not go back to the bad old days when the unitedstates turned away from the rest of the world and lost so much of its influence and respect we all recognize the very difficult budget and economic situation that confronts us there is no doubt that wellcrafted reforms will help us to use our foreign assistance dollars more effectively and efficiently and ensure that aid reaches those who need it that is why i am continuing my efforts to develop legislation to modernize our foreign assistance policies and programs but what we need to do as one conservative blogger has suggested is to mend it not end it comparatively speaking diplomacy and development dont cost much and save us money over the long run international affairs funding helps promote unitedstates exports and saves unitedstates jobs our economy cant grow without creating and expanding new markets abroad our diplomats help to identify export opportunities help american companies navigate foreign political systems and level the playing field for american products around the globe we should also keep in mind that international affairs accounts for just one percent of the budget even if we eliminated such spending entirely it wouldnt balance the budget and it wouldnt make a dent in our national debt but it would devastate our economy and our national security as secretary gates said last fall development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers in places like haiti and sudan we provide assistance not only for purely humanitarian reasons but also because a failure to do so could lead to chaos and bloodshed that would be far more costly in the long run going back to 2008 levels of global aids funding would mean ending antiretroviral treatment for people who are currently receiving it it would mean abandoning pregnant women who run a high risk of transmitting hiv to their newborns it would mean fewer orphans and vulnerable children will get care and support and fewer people in poor countries will get hiv counseling and testing president bush made clear not only the need to not cut funding but to make greater investments in these programs when he wrote just a few months ago there are millions on treatment who cannot be abandoned and the progress in many african nations depends on the realistic hope of new patients gaining access to treatment on aids to stand still is to lose ground these are only a few of the most obvious and damaging implications of reducing the international affairs budget to

insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare

or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this

"i am grateful for the opportunity to allow members of the progressive caucus to continue this discussion and as well to continue to educate the american public it is worth noting that part of the discussion that occurred on the floor of the house is that we have come to this point if i might say through a peculiar process some might call it hostagetaking but certainly it is a process that has skewed if you will the regular order of this congress this little book the constitution of the united states that can fit into a document of this size even though it is found in law books and many major largesized books in the library of congress hopefully convinces the american people of the wisdom of the founding fathers it is noteworthy that they did not include a balanced budget amendment in the first group of amendments called the bill of rights and even as they proceeded they took the challenge of speaking to any number of issues the freeing of the slaves in the 13th 14th and 15th amendments giving the right to vote finally in the 15th amendment suggesting that there should be no obstacles to voting they went on to the 24th amendment to indicate that there should be no poll tax the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote but never did they feel the necessity to talk about a balanced budget amendment the reason i believe that they cast their lot on the responsible thinking of members of congress is because that is what we are supposed to do we are supposed to be responsible members of the united states congress with no intervening body no layered approach no handcuffing of our deliberation and thats what a balanced budget amendment is all about youve just listened to a portion of our debate we will go on into tomorrow mind you taking up 5 hours of time that could be dedicated to coming together around job creation the underlying premise of this bill is that twothirds of this body twothirds of the other body and threequarters of the states must consent to a balanced budget amendment thank goodness that our founding fathers made amending the constitution so difficult and that is because they wanted us to be thoughtful so when we think of the amendments that are in this book this little book that starts off with we the people a part of the declaration of independence and then the beginning part of the constitution says that we have come together to form a more perfect union theyve made it that challenging so that we could be thoughtful in our moving amendments maybe for those of us who are in certain types of church families whether it be baptist or the underlying overriding general protestant structure we know that there are pastors ministers reverends board of trustees a board or maybe a deacon board there is some sort of policy board and then there is a congregation the reason why i mentioned the faith community is because we can get very sensitive about how our places of worship are run how the business part of it is run and you would wonder how many congregations would welcome the overlay of some outside entityalbeit formed by membersthat was over the pastor that was over the board of trustees that was over the congregation thats what we have done and forced ourselves to do with the intervening supercommittee that was put together by the concept of needing to raise the debt ceiling and then adding into it another hot pepper pot and that is of course having to be forced to pass a balanced budget amendment i want to refer my colleagues again to a headline in a local paper sheila jackson lee cant slow down the republican balancedbudget amendment freight train its not necessarily because it was my name but thats just what we have experienced a freight train i have no doubt that there will be a strong vote tomorrow i am hoping that the debate will generate enough thought to cause many of my colleagues to reflect on whether or not we could in the regular order do some of the suggestions that have been made taxation of investment transactions where many who are well vested and who have experienced the bounty of this land would be willing to contribute and to understand how we should move forward the expiration of the bush tax cuts another revenuegenerator that would i believe increase the opportunities for reducing the debt getting rid of the mighty if you will bungled opportunity to help seniors becoming a gigantic handout budgetary fiasco medicare part dask every senior when you visit them at their senior centers are they begging for the closing of the doughnut hole but more importantly are they trying to get relief from medicare part d give them relief close the doughnut hole and you will find a huge amount of money going into the treasury going back to the affordable care act and implementing the public option and allowing the united states to negotiate the cost of medications prescription drugs under medicarejust watch the debt go down down down so i want to recite as i did on the floor of the house the words of chairman ben bernanke the chairman of the federal reserve who indicated to the committee on financial services we really dont want to just cut cut cut you need to be a little bit cautious about sharp cuts in the very near term because of the potential impact on the recovery that doesnt at all precludein fact i believe its entirely consistent witha longerterm program that will bring our budget into a sustainable position nowhere did he say well why dont you just do a balanced budget amendment with no thinking and not being able to deal with emergencies beyond another vote by the congress sometimes a majority sometimes even longer a balanced budget amendment was wrong when our founding fathers began to write the constitution it was wrong as the founding fathers wrote amendment after amendment it was wrong to think about it in world war ii to think about it in the 1929 financial collapse to think about it in the conflicts of the 1950s the vietnam war or wars thereafter such as the persian gulf the iraq war and of course the afghan war kosovo bosnia albania libya and places where weve been called to act on behalf of the american people in defending our honor and democracy and protecting the vulnerable around the world it is wrong wrong wrong what the american people who voted for members of the united states congress are asking us to do is what the progressive caucus is doing it is finding a way first of all to submit a reasoned budget that has seen a responsible approach to addressing the needs of revenueraising and belttightening what it is also asking is as the progressive caucus is doing drafting a major omnibus jobs bill that will incorporate a wide range of initiatives many not costly initiatives that will bring about jobs in america not only for those languishing 2 and 3 years unemployed but for our wonderful college graduates and others that are coming out of the institutions of higher learning but as dr jeffrey sachs said we have even more challenges because although we all point to college graduates and going to institutions of higher learning maybe i should wake up america and let you know that we have some of the lowest numbers of college graduation rates probably in the history of america white males at 34 percent african americans somewhere under 20 and hispanics 11 percent so the balanced budget amendment is not going to invest in the human resources of america its not going to answer the question in our competitive reach as we compete around the world its not going to respond to the numbers of ph d s that india is now producing probably in years to come more so than people in the united states or the number of masters and ph d s in china our reach in competition is way beyond our borders but everyone knows that americas marketability is our genius in invention and manufacturing our genius as it relates to prescription drugs our genius in medical science and medicine our genius in silicon valley and the little silicon valleys that are springing up around america our genius for example in the md anderson cancer center located in houston texas the fourth largest city in the nation magnificent research occurring in that institution seeking a viable 21stcentury 22ndcentury cure for this devastating disease but also branching out for creative thinking in the next generation of research that is the genius of america we are not broke and were certainly not broke in our genius let us be reminded as we debate the balanced budget amendment that our corporations are flush with cash our banks are flush with cash and countries around the world are eager to have us hold their money in the framework of loans that are being made to us if they wish to loan to anyone they are eager to loan to the united states why because they believe their cash is safe so it is important that we are thoughtful in the idea of a balanced budget amendment and why now why are we doing a balanced budget amendment in the course of the need to do as dr sachs has said longterm systematic changes in how we do business in the united states of america so just take a fact sheet on the question of the balanced budget amendment it came about because we went to the brink of raising the debt ceiling something that had been done many times since president eisenhower going forward to presidents thereafter many times under bush i the 41st president of the united states many times under the 42nd president of the united states william jefferson clinton many times under the 43rd president of the united states and lo and behold an african american president ascends to the presidency voted on by the american people and the debt ceiling becomes a crisis in the making and frankly the pundits economists around the world indicated it was not the question of raising the debt ceiling it was the debacle shown around the world that the members of congress were not allowed to get their business in order they were not allowed to debate this in a reasoned manner they were strung and strangled by voices that are driven by outside party politics in this instance the tea party and those who adhere to pledges governed by mr norquist so it is important that a constitutional debate be separated from the entrenched political views that would disallow a thoughtful discussion we could have raised the debt ceiling with a thoughtful discussion but it came with not strings but ladened with heavy steel bricks tied to our arms and body as we walked slowly and dragged down so we have a supercommittee with great respect for those working i have the greatest respect for our colleagues and wish them well we have the requirement of a balanced budget amendment a constitutional discussion dragged down by the requirement that youre not going to get the debt ceiling raised youre not going to be able to pay the bills for our seniors and our soldiers on the battlefield if you didnt hang with all of this weight to carry forth an instruction that really is not done thoughtfully so heres what we get with the balanced budget amendment we risk default by the united states by requiring a supermajority to raise the debt limit it destroys 15 million jobs and doubles unemployment to 18 percent if enacted in fiscal year 2012 nonpartisan economists with macroeconomic advisers llc estimate that enactment of a balanced budget amendment would eliminate 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate to 18 percent and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent remember what i said dragged down by steel anvils tied to our legs and arms our ankles around our necks this is what we will be doing tomorrow this is what the vote will entail tomorrow it harms seniors by cutting medicare and social security and veterans by reducing their benefits even though social security is solvent until 2035 requiring a thoughtful decision of how we go forward and even though there are ways to eliminate waste fraud and abuse from medicare without cutting providers we want to go with a balanced budget amendment which could result in medicare being cut by about 750 billion social security 1 2 trillion and veterans benefits 85 million through 2021 how many of us joined our neighbors in celebrating veterans day last friday i did we went to the veterans hospital and shook the hands of bedridden veterans and promised them by giving them cards of cheer that we would not in any way cut their benefits these cuts will result in draconian cuts worse than the ryan gop budget it opens the doors for courts to interveneand the gentleman from illinois may want to comment on thisin federal budget decisions by placing the balanced budget amendment into the constitution it will generate enormousin fact there will be a line to the courthouse on constitutional challenges on cutting pell grants and cutting food stamps and cutting housing and cutting veterans benefits as i said

addresses all regions meets the needs of all of our producers so we can as farmers and ranchers meet the needs of the great american consumer one of the key points in the motion to recommit before us addresses the question of doing a 5year farm bill thats a sense of congress i happen to think that that already is the sense of congress i would suggest to all of you that if you want as badly as i want a comprehensive 5year farm bill then the process here is to take these pointsthey may be validbut to take these points and bear them in mind go home and see your constituents for the next 5 weeks go home and discuss the drought in that 65 percent of the united states thats suffering go home and explain to them why from the livestock producers perspective theres no assistance in a bill that was promised when it was put together in 08 or they thought they would have access to go home and explain that and build the momentum to come back here and do the farm bill then in regular order on the floori know its kind of a strange conceptwell debate these and many more amendments and well make refinements to what the committee has done but right now lets reject this motion and lets go home and

federal government are going to be out of a job thats significant but whats really significant in the long term is that this is sending a signal to the world not just america that the american political process is fundamentally broken if we are unable to reach an agreement on a 1week continuing resolution to keep government going what are the prospects for us when we face the challenge of a budget next year what are the prospects for us when we face the challenge that looms ahead of us in may of raising the debt ceiling so that america can honor the obligation that it has to pay its

the chairman and ranking member of this committee i rise in support of the thompsonberkley amendment which is nearly identical to h r 1832 the bipartisan servicemembers telemedicine and ehealth portability act or step act this amendment will bring essential reforms to how our servicemembers and veterans access care and will bring commonsense nocost changes to how the department of defense administers health care currently the department of defense has a limited ability to allow its health care professionals to provide care when a patient is in a different state the department of defenses hands are also tied when it comes to civilians or contractors who have stepped up to fill shortages in desperately needed positions especially mental health as a result many in the military are required to travel long distances in order to access care this can add undue stress and financial burdens to the everyday lives of our service men and women too often these circumstances contribute to those going without who need help the most and in some cases contribute to their falling through the cracks by removing location requirements this amendment will allow the department of defense qualified and credentialed health care professionals including contractors and civilians to get to their core mission of helping their compatriots in need this will allow our national guard reserves veterans and retirees quicker and more efficient access to care and will open the door to allow for the modernization of department of defense health care delivery this amendment will allow for new technologies in telephone and internet communications to expand into the department of defense which will greatly expand access especially in rural america it will also allow more specialists to be involved in providing care when it comes to behavioral health the guard and reserves have been hit especially hard this amendment will allow for the guard and reserves to access behavioral health care right from their homes immediately when they need it the most this has been a very important issue to me ive met with our military and veterans over the past several months and have closely examined the behavioral health issues affecting our young men and women recently vice chief of staff of the army general peter chiarelli said the army like the larger american society is suffering from a shortage of behavioral health specialists and that is in fact a national crisis efforts in telebehavioral healthallowing specialists to meet with patients through teleconferencing technology for instancecould increase the effectiveness and reach of a limited number of providers but the general then said there are challenges regarding the credentialing and licensing of specialists to work across state lines this amendment will directly address this issue and has the means to dramatically improve and change how our nations warriors access care with these restrictions removed it opens new doors to how the department of defense can administer and expand its health care programs to be clear there is nothing in this amendment that is intended to change or to be the basis for any future change to the department of defense or statebased scope of practice laws or regulations ultimately this amendment is about technology and modernization it is about new ways for servicemembers and veterans to access care it is about fulfilling a pledge to take care of our veterans regardless of where they live at no new cost to the taxpayers this bipartisan amendment has broad support from the pentagon and military community some of the most notable groups include the air force association the american legion the association of the united states navy the enlisted association of the national guard iraq and afghanistan veterans of america mental health america military officers association of america national guard association of the united states reserve enlisted association and the veterans of foreign wars i ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense bipartisan nocost amendment as memorial day approaches we owe our veterans and servicemembers as much i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
