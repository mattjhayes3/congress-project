rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [5.364418029785156e-06, 0.9999946355819702, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman

5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors

back here for another session of good and hard work i represent a pretty diverse district i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs and cook and will counties a lot of industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our tax code we have legislation today which now has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house that is cosponsoring the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 cosponsored by myself and the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from indiana as well as 230 members of the house that is why it is so important we want to bring fairness to the tax code that is why i am so pleased that the leadership of this house led by the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has made a decision to move a standalone piece of legislation a standalone bill which wipes out the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of those who suffer in the next few weeks the speaker intends to bring that legislation to the floor that is good news as we work to bring fairness to the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i was just informed earlier today that the president in his state of the union speech tonight is going to discuss eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is good news because it is time to make it a bipartisan effort and while the president and vice president gore vetoed the legislation last year he is now coming our way i am very pleased let us make it a

stop wrongdoing an article in the british guardian newspaper indicates that in dragash two members of the kpc and three others were arrested by u n police in connection with the killing of an ethnic gorani it goes on to say the u n report cited three charges of illtreatment and torture in pec a man was beaten senseless in the kpcs headquarters suffering head injuries and severe bruising from a rifle butt in prizren a man from the torbesh minority was kidnapped and beaten up by a kpc member and three other men and in prizren kfor suspended alleged torturers from the kpc a gao report on

carrying unauthorized weapons and engaging in violence and intimidation against ethnic minorities so the goals of the u n as stated in u n resolution 1244 are actually being impeded by the kpc these goals include deterring renewed hostilities demilitarizing armed groups ensuring public safety and order and protecting and promoting human rights the u n itself cited the kpc for threatening u n personnel in efforts to intervene in wrongdoing so not only is the kpc responsible for human rights violations but the kpc is making it harder for the u n to accomplish peace in kosovo an amnesty

people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is

sensitive countries includes in addition to china and russia india and pakistan the official indicated that different criteria were used for putting countries on the list and that india and pakistan were included because they are not signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty i too am deeply concerned about the persistent pattern of chinas theft of our nuclear secrets i have come to this floor on several occasions to call for more safeguards against chinese espionage as well as to focus more attention on chinas documented actions with regard to nuclear proliferation which include providing nuclear and missile technology to unstable countries like pakistan but in the case of india we clearly do not have the facts to support the conclusion that india is involved in the same types of activities as china thus i would urge members of the senate and the house as well as the administration not to jump to any conclusions about india without the facts what we know is that unitedstates india relations have suffered in the past year because of the nuclear tests conducted by india last may but one key fact that is often overlooked is that indias nuclear program is essentially indigenous developed by indias own scientists export controls on supercomputers and other dual use technology have been in effect against india for years forcing india to develop its own highly advanced r d infrastructure another very important point is that india has kept its nuclear technology to itself out of the hands of rogue regimes and international sponsors of terrorism this is in marked contrast to china which has not only stolen our technology but has shared very sensitive information with unstable countries in asia and the middle east i fully agree that we need to be more wary of china this is an authoritarian country a oneparty state the communist party with a terrible record on human rights and a record of intimidation and aggression against its neighbors indeed

this opportunity to commend my colleague from california mr calvert for his work on this important issue and for bringing this bill to the floor ori marchl 27 1996 i intoduced h r 3173 the consurner products safe testing act this legislation was introduced to promote more humane business practices increase the efficiency of the federal government encourage scientific innovation and most importantly ensure continued consumer safety while eliminating unnecessary and inhumane product safety testing on animals today h r 4281 the iccvam authorization act of 2000legislation that is the successor to the bill i originally introduced in early 1996represents the culmination of efforts which began over 5 years ago h r 4281 is a nonpartisan noncontroversial bill that emphasizes the protection of both human health and animal welfare by facilitating the development acceptance and implementation of nonanimal product safety tests this bill comes to the floor with an impressive marriage of diverse interests working together to support it distinguished members from both political parties industry leaders and animal welfare organizations have joined forces to produce a commonsense piece of legislation that safeguards both human and animal wellbeing i am honored and delighted that h r 4281 is supported by the procter gamble company the gillette company the colgatepalmolive company the american chemistry council the american humane association the humane society of the united states the doris day animal league and millions of americans who have demanded safe and reliable alternatives to product safety testing on animals for over fifty years federal regulators have conducted product safety tests on animals in the last decade however biotechnology companies have researched developed and manufactured alternative testing procedures that have proved to be just as safe reliable and in many cases much more cost effective yet these innovative technologies have never had an established protocol for receiving approval by federal agencies in addition industries desiring to implement alternative testing methods have endured a frustrating and confusing federal process for alternative test method review and approval despite the fact that many industries have committed themselves to ensuring human safety while eliminating unnecessary inhumane animal test methods now for the first time this legislation which we are considering here on the floor of the house today will enable industries to cut through bureaucratic redtape and speed the implementation of safe and reliable nonanimal test methods while functioning solely on an adhoc basis the interagency coordinating committee for the validation of alternative methods iccvam has established sound criteria for the validation and acceptance of alternative methods to product safety testing on animals and it will require federal agencies to consider the iccvams recommendations on alternative test methods more importantly h r 4281 eliminates the incentive for industries to prefer status quo animal tests by giving the iccvam the authority to make an otherwise fragmented regulatory process coherent cost effective and more readily accessible the adoption of h r 4281 will demonstrate a commitment to increasing the alof health and environmental safety of all americans by simplifying the process by which industries implement more technologically advanced methods of research into their product safety testing protocols we must ensure that as we enter the 21st century the federal govemnment is working efficiently to incorporate scientific progress into product safety tests and not solely relying on antiquated and inhumane animal tests to safeguard human health with

for supporting this bill including the pay raise for our armed forces and the health care for our retirees i want to add one more reason to vote for this bill and that is because of the provisions which enact an important agreement to save the drinking water for 25 million citizens in the southwest united states these provisions would move the largest uranium mine tailings pile that has ever threatened a drinking water supply in the unitedstates the dangerous radioactive waste currently sits only 750 feet away from the colorado river near moab utah where it threatens the drinking water of oneseventh of the united states including people who live in las vegas arizona and the southern california urban areas of los angeles and of course the city i represent san diego i want to thank my colleagues the gentleman from california and the gentleman from utah for their leadership in moving this pile which is as big as 118 football fields rather than what was previously suggested which was capping it in place we have all fought for 3 years to prevent the nuclear regulatory commission from doing just that capping the pile because that would ensure that the poisonous waste would continue to leach into the colorado river for almost 300 years this bill gives jurisdiction to move the pile to the department of energy which has the expertise and experience to relocate it to a secure permanent location safely away from the colorado river i want to congratulate all those who have worked so hard to cement this agreement into law instead of allowing the capping of this huge pile of

the amendment offered by representative largent to the district of columbia appropriations bill this amendment would prohibit unmarried couples from jointly adopting children i believe that local governments should be allowed to make the proper decision concerning adoptions based on the universally accepted standards that regards the best interest of the child family law is not an area that congress generally addresses because it is a local concern state and local jurisdictions are better suited to address issues of domestic relations there is no reason to deny potential parents the right to adopt a child based on their marital status if we do not deny single people the right to adopt then an unmarried couple should not face such a restriction this amendment places the children that are currently waiting to be adopted at risk for remaining in the foster care system that would not be in the best interest of any child these children need consistent care and a safe home this amendment suggests that an unmarried couple cannot provide a child with a proper environment to develop intellectually and socially but this amendment only makes that suggestion of the residents of d c currently d c and 48 other states allow lesbian and gay couples to adopt when it is in the best interest of the child it is clear that two loving parents offer a child greater stability than one parent yet we would make this distinction if the couple is unmarried living in d c i oppose this amendment because i believe that the needs of children to be in a loving environment should not hinge

crisis i cannot say how terrible it is relative to the farm economy in north dakota i have with me today some auction bills we have been seeing a lot of these auction bills consider that each auction bill represents a sale of a family farm the end of literally generations of tradition of farming the land it goes on for pages recently ag week periodical which covers the red river valley the most prosperous part of agriculture in my state published 150 farm auctions this is 150 individual operators throwing in the towel ending again the tradition handed down for generations of making a living off their land in each case it is a tragedy and something to be avoided one friend of mine and i am going to offer this for the record who is selling out after 120 consecutive years of production on this family farm wrote an oped to the newspaper and he has on the title of it now at least we do not have to wonder anymore there are an awful lot of families wondering tonight whether or not they will be able to get a crop in the ground this spring imagine we all deal with career uncertainty surely as members of the house up for election every other year we really never know until the election is over what we are going to be doing but we have people at this late point in the spring not knowing whether they will be able to put a crop in the ground right now obviously if they cannot get the financing to get a crop in the ground they have no idea what they are going to do to put shoes on their kids feet to put food on the table we have got a fullblown crisis in agriculture directly related to the financing capital farmers need to get their crop in the ground this spring for that reason the administration advanced several weeks ago emergency funding requests so that we might have additional loan authority funded the request is for 152 million and it is part of the supplemental appropriations bill sent up by the white house 109 million of that would make 1 1 billion in additional lending authority available to farmers 42 million so that the usda could actually hire additional staff to process these applications and get the money out here is what has happened in light of the collapse in commodity prices farmers have had terrible losses as they sit down with their regular bankers they are unable to show cash flow and therefore unable ineligible in many cases for the financing that they had otherwise expected now there are programs available for these farmers fsa lending programs direct lending programs usda loan guarantee programs but because so many have had trouble in lending in the normal course they have come to the usda and overwhelmed the resources available for those usda loans right now north dakota we have a backlog we do not have enough money to meet the loan need now and it is anticipated that that loan need is going to increase dramatically over the next few days there is 4 4 million in unmet loan need that has come into the north dakota fsa offices over the last 2 days alone this is a crisis and it is a crisis with a very narrow window of time for us to address if a farmer cannot get the crop in the ground in the spring the money coming along here in july or august is not going to do a lick of good the window is gone they have lost the chance to plant and for these operators that means they have lost the farm i would say to my colleagues please let us move this supplemental appropriation request along everyone knows of the urgent straits in farm country not just in north dakota or south dakota but throughout the country and we must respond to this by getting that loan guarantee money replenished so that it can get out to the farmers so they can get their crop in the ground this spring so they dont lose their farms it is as simple as that it is very straightforward this is a body that unfortunately sometimes cannot operate very quickly but there is just no mistake the urgency is now we have to act failure to act is
