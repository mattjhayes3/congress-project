of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0003484487533569336, 0.9996515512466431, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that

budget we have heard today presents it as a noble and responsible attempt to respond to the harsh economic realities facing our nation and our people but when we examineit objectively we cant avoid seeing the reality behind the pretense the bill is designed to do everything it can to protect the record tax cuts for the richest of americans for the majority that is more important than educating our children or providing health care to the veterans or helping americans raise themselves out of poverty or even protecting our country from the consequences of either national disasters or mounting national debt the authors and supporters of the legislation will tell us that if we wish to avoid increasing our national deficit which they have already driven to unprecedented heights we have no choice but to spend on the programs that americans rely on the most while they are busily cutting out the revenues that come into the government but once again they are offering a false choice for 5 years they have forced the massive tax cuts through the congress last week they made the most recent down payment on the cuts one was 70 billion while president bush signs that bill into law today republicans are asking us to pass this bill which adds another 158 billion to those cuts so in 2 weeks we have made those massive cuts and any justification melts away when we realize who is benefiting from it they are not for the poor they are not for the working class they are not for the middle class they are for the oil companies they wont spur our economy or help the average person afford their morning drive to work they are instead the cuts for billionaires and millionaires pure and simple they are not going to help the economy but they will indeed help people who dont need it and that assistance will come at the expense of everyone else but as always the case despite objections not just from democrats but much of the american public reducing or extending these cuts isnt even on the table here it never is they are considered too sacred to touch and just tonight in the rules committee once again we turned down an opportunity to pay for more by taking away part of their tax cut what do we get in exchange for this giveaway well the majority offered us a budget that will cut domestic spending between 1 and 2 percent every year as a result the party that tells us to support the troops is cutting veterans health care by 6 billion and we worry and fear for the over 20 000 young soldiers in iraq and afghanistan who have been grievously lifealtering wounded will not be able to get the care they need when they come back republicans who promised to leave no child behind will be cutting education funding by 45 3 billion and the budget of the department of education by 2 2 billion now not content to make education less rewarding in the present they apparently want to make our students worry more about loan payments in the future the bill eliminates all mandatory spending on student loans leaving congressional appropriators to somehow find 600 million to meet the students needs the majority wants to cut environmental protection efforts by 25 billion and take over 1 billion from community development and social service initiatives which we desperately need the poorest of the poor wont find any relief at all in this legislation in fact they will find the opposite the budget will underfund housing and child care assistance by 447 million over the next year and over 5 years the funding for them will fall almost 15 billion short what will the results be well consider the fate of the commodity supplemental food program which provides nutritious meals to 420 000 lowincome elderly and 50 000 mothers and children at a cost of 111 million a year the budget eliminates it entirely it may make sense that they are forcing the cuts through congress so they can afford the handouts to the rich but perhaps that really is what todays republican party stands for but apparently they also stand for something new contrary to their rhetoric irresponsible government spending the legislation before us will increase our deficit without a vote by 410 billion over the next 5 years at the same time it increases the debt limit by over 650 billion by 2011 the limit will stand at 9 6 trillion when the clinton administration left office the debt limit was about 4 5 trillion and they left us the greatest surplus we have ever had the majority claims the bill will make us more fis cally secure but what they really do is sow the seeds of greater insecurity both now and for years to come when we realize that it isnt necessity driving this bill but rather a world view that puts the richest americans ahead of everybody else we are not left with much else to say but shame we dont share these values democrats believe instead as did that great republican president theodore roosevelt and countless other americans that investing in the middle class which is disappearing quickly and guaranteeing broad prosperity is the surest way to ensure sustained economic growth"], [0.00042128562927246094, 0.9995787143707275, 1, "i just want to make sure mr ryan that the american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.0007070302963256836,

fiscal year of 2006 and with no budget in place for fiscal 2007 i commend my distinguished democratic colleagues on the budget committee for takingthis time to call americas attention to the fiscal challenges resulting from the republicans misguided policies and the wrong choices they have made for our economy misplaced spending priorities and bad decisions have consequences they are leading us further down the path to fiscal ruin and expanding the wedge between middleclass families and the superwealthy i am proud to join my colleagues to highlight the hypocrisy of the overriding republican economic philosophy that extending dividends capital gains and other tax cuts for millionaires and corporations create a rising tide that lifts all boats five years after the presidents 1 5 trillion tax cut our national debt now approaches 10trillion if our tax cuts performed as promised by those across the aisle an exploding economy would have wiped out this debt we have already proven that more needs to be done than just hope that sooner or later tax cuts will reach americans who need help the most but those who do need help must get in line and hope that the benefits of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will ultimately trickle down to them perhaps the expanding gulf between the haves and the almosthaves is best illustrated by the fact that wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of gross domestic product since the government began keeping records on that in 1947 while corporate profits continue to break alltime records meanwhile the buying power of the minimum wage has sunk to its lowest level in 50 years what is missing are policies that ensure that the benefits of higher corporate earnings productivity and globalization are widely shared such as real government support for higher education a progressive tax code and affordable health care when choices are made at the expense of our safety net choices that benefit the top 1 percent who will never struggle to pay a mortgage never struggle to keep up with gas prices never struggle to put their children through school it is clear that a new direction for our economy is long overdue how can the republicans argue that this economy is bound in the right direction when our nation is saddled with recordbreaking deficits over 4 consecutive years combined with deep and painful cuts to hospitals to schools and to security at least the republicans budget outlook since 2001 has been consistent americans could bank on the american budgets to slash funding for proven homeland security programs veterans benefits education and health care priorities all the while cutting taxes for millionaires who need the break the least as reallife indicators of poor federal spending choices such as stagnant wages soaring crime rates and rising health care premiums and drug prices begin to take their toll on americans it is our responsibility to react instead inaction reigns under the direction of the current leadership in some cases this inaction has yielded to halfhearted solutions such as an energy bill that does more for oil aild gas companies than lower gas prices a medicare bill that does more for drug companies and hmos than make lifesaving drugs affordable a pension bill that takes it easy on corporate boards while ignoring the decline of traditional defined benefit plans eleven days away from the start of the fiscal year the record of this republican congress on the economy shows that we have not completed a budget or a single appropriations bill fiscal irresponsibility has reached unprecedented new lows depending on how you look at it the debt limit has been raised for the fifth time in as many years to almost 10 trillion perhaps we shouldnt be worried after all the presidents budget director said last month that 200 billion annual deficits are sustainable indefinitely apparently normal budget rules dont apply to this administration but they do apply to a middleclass family of four living on long island whose monthly costofliving expenses due mostly to rising gas prices and health care costs are rapidly exceeding wage increases perhaps their creditors and collection agents will understand that outstanding debts owed by families sinking deeper into red ink are sustainable indefinitely we can fix this mess we have the blueprint a new direction for america and we only need to look to past and proven methods like the payasyougo budget rules that were enforced in the previous administration and produced surpluses that helped us start buying down our national debt indeed we democrats resolve to restore what should be the goals of our federal budget to reflect the priority of our nation to build a strong economy and to set policies

erroneous action of the bushcheney administration in their war of choice on iraq its no surprise that bush cheney and rumsfeld seek this late coating of whitewash that this resolution attempts to provide the war on iraq was unjustified has been egregiously mismanaged and has made all americans less safe americans were told repeatedly by president bush and vice president cheney that iraq had weapons of mass destruction none were ever found president bush and vice president cheney repeatedly implied that iraq was involved in the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 the preponderance of intelligence before the attack on iraq contradicted that and no such evidence has been found the conduct of president bushs war of choice has been plagued with incompetent civilian leadership decisions that have cost many lives and rendered the war on and occupation of iraq a strategic policy disaster for the united states the incompetence and corruption involved in the reconstruction have rendered that expensive effort largely ineffective the most critical muchcited incompetent decision on the part of the bush administration was to commit far too small a force for the huge dangerous and multifaceted tasks at hand because of that egregious blunder in judgment and planning by the bush administration our severely overextended troops took many more casualties than necessary and they could not stop the looting of the treasures of iraqs ancient culture and the public institutions of present day iraqits schools universities and hospitals seize control of saddams huge conventional weapons depots which have been used to kill our service men and women throughout the insurgency control the borders against the influx into iraq of senior terrorists from bin ladens international network who wanted to be part of killing americans provide the iraqi civilian population security from the sunnibaathist insurgency as it grew in strength and hold the ground fought over with insurgents in search and destroy missions which left whole cities in ruins and whatever remained of the civilian population a fertile recruiting ground for more insurgents the incompetence regarding body and vehicle armor rises almost to a level of criminal negligence the militarys own report says that onethird of deaths and casualties could have been avoided if proper body armor and vehicle armor had been provided from the start of the war our soldiers civilian leaders did not follow a first maxim of war protect your troops american service men and women deserved better and the civilian leaders who failed them should be held accountable but instead of honoring our soldiers now with an honest debate about the war its conduct and its prospects we are presented today with a thick coating of whitewash this resolution is dishonest on its very face even though there was no connection between afghanistan and iraq h res 861 seeks desperately to make that false connection it seeks to transform the bad decision to wage war on iraq as a valid component of the global war on terror it seeks to cast the missteps and incompetence in iraq as progress in the global war on terror even though there was never any philosophical or operational connection between saddam hussein and al qaeda the president and his republican allies in congress seek by this resolution to rewrite history and recast the war on iraq as having positive implications in the war on terrorism exactly the opposite is true after 9 11 in part because so many nations lost citizens in the world trade center america enjoyed virtually total global support and willingness to collaboratively destroy the bin laden al qaeda network the opportunity was there to work carefully with the entire world including almost all muslim nations to make americans and the whole world safer by isolating and~shutting down al qaeda did we complete that mission no bin laden is still at large and the conditions in afghanistan are deteriorating instead president bush started a second war unrelated to 9 11 and the hunt for bin ladens networks and his followers weve now spent well over 350 billion on an effort that has not achieved its own goals and due to its astronomical cost and resource drain has severely undercut our ability to pursue and destroy bin ladens international terrorist network with its many cells that existed in 2002 continue to exist today and certainly will exist into the future twentyfive hundred fine young american men and women have lost their lives 95 percent of whom have been killed since president bush declared mission accomplished more than 3 years ago america has also forever lost the service of thousands of good soldiers who are now disabled as a result of battle wounds in iraq many others will need mental and emotional rehabilitation before they can return to normal life the multiple redeployments of guard and reserve troops have severely undercut the retention and recruitment prospects for the fighting force we depend upon to protect us president bush and his administration have defended torture and rendition and ignored the geneva conventions america has lost the moral high ground with the rest of the world and we have fewer allies as a result president bush and his administration have undermined the war on terror by using tactics outlawed by international treaty and condemned by even our closest friends and finally president bushs war on iraq has provided al qaeda a training and recruitdlent ground that it could not have hoped for in its wildest dreams as well as a golden opportunity to target americans right in the unprotected center of the middle east president bushs war on iraq is viewed broadly in islamic communities as an attack on islam and thus the president has alienated a large part of one fifth of the worlds population the most extreme individuals and factions in islamic countries are now more motivated than ever to kill americans and the number of potential terrorists has greatly expanded so a truthful assessment of how america is doing in the war on terror as a result of president bushs war on iraq is that we have been set back by decades bad decisions and incompetence have achieved a vast determination in countless desperate impoverished disaffected and oppressed young muslim men and women to take out their anger and express their fundamentalism and radicalism by attacking americans and american interests we are far less safe as a nation and will remain so throughout our lifetimes and our childrens lifetimes clearly a stable unified and democratic iraq cannot be achieved militarily by the unitedstates our servicemen and women have done the best job that can be done in the situation into which their civilian leaders have placed them and they deserve the highest level of gratitude from all americans they have already taken too many casualtiestoo many dead too many woundedbecause they were too few and too poorly provided with the armor they needed to succeed safely if a unified and stable iraq is to emerge out of the ethnic and sectarian violence that is so perilously close to civil war the iraqi people and their government must make the political compromises necessary to secure a successful democracy they must find in themselves a new nation we cannot do that for them we can only give them the opportunity to do it nor should we accept the presidents mantra when the iraqis stand up we will stand down a nice slogan but that is simply a recipe for an unlimited occupation we need to make it clear that we will withdraw from iraq within 6 to 9 monthsso that the iraqis will know that they must stand up and defend the opportunity given to them we should immediately state that we will seek no permanent military bases in iraq in the remaining months we should focus on achieving more robust international involvement in training of iraqi soldiers police officers judges teachers and doctorsall key elements needed to end the sectarian and civil conflict and build iraqs future and we should prepare for the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops the bush administration has made many grievous and costly errors in iraq over the past 31 2 years and made little if any progress in the war on terrorism thereby it is time to bring our young people home"],

found on page 1 the american people have given up on the republican party because the republican party has given in to special interests the republican vision for america is to let the privileged few run the country thats what the record demonstrates as incredible as it is the american people today are subsidizing oil companies democrats introduced legislation months ago to end the taxpayers subsidy but republicans will not even debate it at a time when the american people are paying 3 a gallon for gas they are paying even more to big oil in taxpayers subsidies republicans are out of touch with the american people their taxpayer subsidy pipeline flows your money to big oil so does the doughnut hole that the elderly are beginning to fall through because republicans care more about drug companies than they do about the american elderly a report released by the house ways and means committee democrats concludes that 88 percent of seniors who bought a drug plan through medicare bought one with a big financial hole in it dug by republicans we are talking about 7 million seniors within a month they will have to pay their drug bill even as they continue their insurance premium to big business under republican rules special interests got special treatment and the seniors fell in the hole the republicans have left no special interest behind college tuition is up 57 percent at

interest rates on student loans republicans also passed sweetheart rules to indenture the american people to banks after personal bankruptcy it is worth noting that the number one reason for personal bankruptcy in america today is staggering unpaid medical expenses what have the republicans done they have allowed the number of uninsured in this country to swell to almost 47 million people they gave the rich a tax cut called health savings accounts out of reach for most americans out of reach out of touch the republican party caters to the top 1 percent the republicans gave the superrich on average 100 000 a year in tax breaks while the average american gets 50 bucks then the republicans held hostage the democrats proposal to raise the minimum wage for the first time in 9 years they do not care about workers and while republicans talk a lot about being afraid they fail to protect the american people by implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 commission republicans

deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we

opportunity to thank house democratic leader nancy pelosi for the opportunity for the 30something working group to talk for an hour about the things that we know are important to our generation and also to explain and discuss our views on our generations perspective on a lot of the issues that are important and facing americans today tonight i am really pleased to be joined during womens history month by two of my distinguished colleagues who are also members of leader pelosis 30something working group congresswoman stephanie herseth from the great state of south dakota and congresswoman linda sanchez of california the three of us make up a very unique body in this group we are three of only four women younger than 40 years old in the united states house of representatives we are here this evening to celebrate womens history month to remember those who have contributed to our progress tor recognize the women of our generation who are changing communities today and to highlight the challenges that many women under 40 face as a result of the flawed and failed policies of the bush administration this years theme for womens history month is women builders of communities and dreams this theme speaks to the legacy that women leaders have built over the generations mr speaker as advanced and progressive as america has been on issues improving the lives of women our country continues to lag far behind in terms of policies to assist women in their struggle to lead or achieve today women represent more than half the population and are among the most knowledgeable and important thinkers in every field of policy from science to education to health care and national security as the mother of two young daughters it is so important to me to see that strong women walk in all walks of life and i want them to see strong women in all walks of life particularly so that we can see that those women join our ranks here as policymakers i want them to understand that from title ix to the equal pay act that they are standing on the shoulders as we do here of the courageous women who went before them e 2000 none of the three of us would have had the opportunity that we did at our stage in life without our colleagues who came before us in this body without their shoulders to stand on and i want them and other young women and girls to have the same opportunities that we have been given unfortunately the president apparently does not share those same views because in his 2007 budget proposal he slashes programs established to give young working mothers a leg up like medicare medicaid housing food stamps and child care he cuts programs aimed at preventing domestic violence and programs that provide domestic violence victims with housing and legal assistance i am saddened to say that domestic violence affects far too many women and an even growing number of young women forty percent of teenage girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age that has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend and 26 percent of girls in grades 9 through 12 have bedn the victim of abuse so tonight we are here because training education and employment statistics clearly indicate that women still face barriers in pursuing traditionally maledominated fields for instance while the number of women pursuing degrees in higher education has increased dramatically the rates of women pursuing engineering degrees lags far behind recent data shows that women account for only small percentages of students earning engineering degrees including only 20 percent of bachelors degrees 21 percent of masters degrees and only 17 percent of ph ds we are here because the republicans prescription drug plan is a particularly bad deal for americas women women are frustrated and confused and if you think government health and prescription drug care is only for the aged you should know that 63 percent of medicaid beneficiaries were between the ages of 18 and 44 in 2001 and 37 percent of women ages 18 to 44 report that they use at least one prescription drug on a regular basis those are not senior citizen statistics we are here tonight because 36 percent of the 9 4 million women in executive administrative and managerial occupations are under 44 years old and on average women are still making about 76 cents for every dollar that a man makes we are here because opponents of the family and medical leave act are working to hamstring that program even though it is in its 12th successful year and more than 50 million americans have displayed their enthusiastic support by taking job protective leave to care for a new baby a seriously ill family member or to recuperate from their own serious illness and the gentlewoman from california is going to be covering how the administrations policies have impacted working women and working families in particular and we are here because there are not toomany of us to speak up and we must make our voices heard there are 26 men under 40 serving in the united states congress they have several voices more than several we are here because if we do not stay late on this floor if we do not stand up and try to make a difference on behalf of young women and young families and bring these issues that are important to them to the table the three of us together 3 versus 26 then who will that is the question that we

in it was done by immigrants most of them did not make much money and most of them died poor but they had a deep love for america america and constantino brumidi was no exception he was exceptional i want to thank the gentleman from ohio chairman ney and the committee on house administration for bringing the resolution to the house floor i also want to thank the gentleman from florida for managing the resolution the gentleman from florida has been the foremost leader in the congress in promoting brumidis prolific life and his extraordinary legacy it reminds me a bit of a sculptor a famous italianamerican sculptor gaetano federici who came from italy and his sculpture exists all through the metropolitan area in new jersey and new york similar backgrounds came here not to accumulate a tremendous amount of wealth but to reflect their love of america and they showed it and communicated it in their art so it is a personal honor for me to lead the house of representatives in remembering brumidi with the gentleman from florida the last time he was recognized in congress was in 1980 at the 100th anniversary of his death the late congressman peter rodino whom we eulogized just a few weeks ago at his passing a great american constituent my friend an inspiration hosted the service i know that congressman rodino is looking down on this ceremony today and will be here next week perhaps he is with george washington in what brumidi properly named in his most famous work the apotheosis of washington twentyfive years later i am humbled by the opportunity to continue a legacy that congressman rodino pursued with passion yesterday i enjoyed a discussion with a roomful of italianamerican high school students from all across the nation they traveled to washington on a trip to explore the roles that people of their ethnic background play in the federal government we discussed our grand italianamerican heritage we discussed ways to advance its image and when i fielded questions one student asked what is being done now to elevate the positive image of our ethnic community i was happy to respond to this timely question i told the students that today congress would act to authorize a ceremony to honor constantino brumidi the artist of the capitol an american immigrant of both italian and greek descent i explained that we live in a nation of immigrants that brumidi is one of the greatest that we ever welcomed he left rome under unfortunate circumstances having been imprisoned in the great fight in italy for independence with both the vatican and the state romes loss was americas gain when the french occupied rome in 1849 brumidi was accused by the church of being a revolutionary the work he had been doing in the vatican came to an end he set out for america where he hoped our free way of life would allow his talent to flourish he arrived in new york city think of that day in 1852 he was a proud citizen 5 years later heai me 5 years later in fact he was known to sign some of his work c brumidi artist citizen of the united states how fitting after traveling the country for work in 1855 brumidis unique style found its way to the empty walls of the united states capitol he was commissioned by the congress brumidi soon provided a unique ability to apply a classical style to create american themes though paid handsomely at the start of his career brumidi was not inspired by financial gain after 2 years of work he never got a raise but his work continued it continued in the frieze of american history in the brumidi corridor in the senate appropriations committee in the reception room and in the presidents room just to name a few and on february 19 1880 exactly 25 years to the day after brumidi began work at the capitol he died of a kidney failure he died in poverty and following his death brumidis name and work slipped into obscurity much of his artwork was painted over in fact he was looked at as irrelevant it was immaterial it was not until 1952 that his grave site was recognized by the congress the congress that he dedicated his life to physically enhance it was not until 10 years ago that his work has truly begun to be restored brumidi was driven by enormous talent he was driven by enormous patriotism his passion allowed him to adorn the capitol of his adopted country with the grand symbolism of a democratic grecoroman legacy the event that this resolution will authorize takes a step to ensure that americans will never forget one of our greatest historical figures it will work to ensure that every american italian greek or whatever will recognize the name of constantino brumidi one of the greatest immigrants to ever grace america this is the 200th anniversary of his birth this is the 150th anniversary of the beginning of his artistic career and this is the 125th anniversary of his death it is only fitting that congress honor constantino brumidi in this showplace in the capitol rotunda

of the stature that some of those folks hold right now if you are making an argument to support your side of the case there are a number of them that are lets say not at the height of popularity as we speak here today but just to mention a couple of things that the gentleman touched upon especially the environmental concerns for example there is nothing in this bill that would prohibit the protection of land for environmental health and safety reasons however if the land is so regulated as to deny the owner any use of it then yes the owner needs to be paid just compensation the fifth amendment does not have an exemption for environmental laws or any other laws in fact the best approach would be to purchase the land possibly through eminent domain rather than trying to pull a fast one and harm the property owner or take that persons property without just compensation the basic idea is that individual property owners should not bear all of the costs of protecting our communities a few land owners should not have to sacrifice their own land and economic well being for the betterment of a town or a city rather the town should give them just compensation that is what we are supposed to do in this society if we are taking it from a particular individual and they cannot use their land as they want to see fit the rest of us through the appropriate way should give them just compensation the fifth amendment should apply in all taking cases and we should not be carving out exceptions when it comes to public health and safety just like in the kelo legislation we passed we did not carve out exceptions for the private use of eminent domain because some property is not as desirable to the community at large all property should be treated the same and if there is public health or environmental needs to take the land owners should be compensated for its taking there are limits to what the government can do and that limit is called the bill of rights when the government takes private property owners must be fairly compensated fortheir land"], [0.004294395446777344, 0.5042943954467773, 0, "i have read reports received letters and seen documentation which

states ahmadinejad described israel as a disgraceful blot on the face of the islamic world as well as a place that must be wiped off the map as islam is a selfproclaimed religion of peaceful teachings president ahmadinejads words are anything but his portrait of islamic fury that wishes to burn israel turns the entire civilized world against him what kind of leadership is that unfortunately ahmadinejads words are not the only ones of this kind coming from the mouths of iranian leaders in 2001 the president of irans expediency council ali akbar hasemirafsanjani threatened israel with nuclear attack these words are the latest in a string of defiant moves against the international community by iran its uranium enrichment program openly disregards the wamings of the international atomic energy agency and we are all well aware that iran also has been credited with harboring terrorists and relaxing border security with iraq to enableentry into that fledgling democracy these attempts byithe government of iran to destabilize iraq are absolutely despicable and cannot be tolerated if iraqs democracy is to grow in addition to these destabilizing activities in iraq iran has openly supported the violent actions of terrorist groups of hamas and hezbollah both of whom have repeatedly called for the annihilation of israel and have repeatedly backed up that threat with suicide bombings inside israel how can the united states and our allies attempts to spread democracy and promote peace be effective when nations such as iran are protecting and bankrolling such groups this has been a landmark year for the middle east and persian gulf especially in iraq israel and in the palestinian areas we have seen the extremely successful constitutional reforms and democratic elections in iraq unwavering in the face of security risks israel and the palestinian authority reached a milestone agreement regarding the controversial gaza strip settlements in addition lebanon

dollars spent on federal contracting i would like to highlight one important difference between this bill and h r 5060 which passed the house in june the database created under h r 5060 was missing a key component information about federal contraet spending contract information is essential to meaningful public oversight as federal contract spending increases and from 2000 to 2005 it has soared by 86 percent from 203 2 billion to 377 5 billion there is a vital need for the public to be able to track and understand this spending i want to thank chairman davis and majority whip blunt for reconsidering their position on the contract information issue and hope that our efforts today will make federal contract information freely and easily accessible to the public i also want to commend the hard work of senator coburn and senator obama on this legislation as members of congress we have a responsibility to increase public understanding of federal spending and public access to information about how taxpayer dollars are spent currently the public has access to a grants data system the federal assistance award data system that provides limited information about domestic grants but this system is unwieldy and difficult to use in addition there is a publicly available database of contracts the federal procurement data system fpds but it is too plagued with problems so today we try to improve on those systems the key to success will be implementation without it we will be where we are now with poor access to information if implemented properly public oversight of

before last mr reilly described it as a love story that began 43 years ago when mr hoyts son rick was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth leaving him brain damaged and unable to control his limbs the hoyts were told rick would be a vegetable for the rest of his life and that they should put him in an institution they refused when rick was 11 they took him to engineers at tufts university to ask them if there was some way to allow him to communicate they were told no way nothing was going on in ricks brain tell him a joke mr hoyt said they did rick laughed they had noticed the way ricks eyes followed them around the room there was a lot going on in ricks brain the engineers rigged up a computer that rick could peck letters on by hitting it with a stick attached to the side of his head his first words were go bruins after a high school classmate of ricks was paralyzed in an accident and a charity run was organized rick pecked out the words dad i want to do that mr hoyt who

all of us from the government and large corporations to small businesses and of course to indi viduals our countrys infrastructure relies on secure information networks that ensure the reliable functioning of ev erything from public finance and control of water systems to the operation of electrical grids and emergency response systems for all of us all americans our information infrastructure is an integral part of our daily life allowing us to communicate with friends and family and pay bills and manage our business imagine if we go to the atm and our money is gone and this

networks these networks that are so much a part of our lives and that is why it makes it such a great potential for targeted attacks by people who wish to harm us and this type of attack would be devastating to our physical safety as well as the economic security of our country that is the reason i think that government needs to be a leader in the field of cyber security when i was talking to some of my companies about this they said the simplest thing abodt like over 50 percent of the people that use a network system do not use passwords we should be using passwords those who use passwords may use something like the name of our dog or our pet well anybody who knows you can guess that or can get that name so i went through and i changed my passwords and i changed gretsky off of my passwords and everything else why because we need to these are very simple individual things that we can do because if once a person gets into the network it goes much wider than that and can go into banking institutions and can go into the house of representatives et cetera so i urge my colleagues to support the goals and ideals of national cyber security awareness month i hope every small

acknowledgment of the extraordinary leadership that the gentleman from new jersey has provided long in the house as a defender of religious freedom and the topic before us with this resolution is one that i kiow is very dear to his heart and so i am grateful for his leadership on this topic this resolution is simple and selfexplanatory any truly free society must by definition accord its citizens freedom to seek a relationship with god according to the dictates of their conscience and choose spiritual leaders whom the worshipers believe are best suited to guide in establishing that relationship recently the peoples republic of china violated the religious freedom of its roman catholic citizens by imposing beijings choices for bishops rather than allowing the vatican to make these appointments this resolution condemns that action and calls upon the chinese government to refrain from any further unauthorized ordinations there are few actions more central to religious practice than choosing the spiritual leaders of a congregation each sunday catholics throughout the world celebrate mass and communally recite the apostles creed which includes a statement of belief in the holy catholic church as an intimate part of that belief catholics acknowledge the supreme leadership of the pope of rome in all spiritual matters and as the chief administrator of the church i am sure none of us would tolerate government coercion of any type in choosing the leaders of our churches synagogues temples and religious organizations nevertheless the chinese government does not allow catholics to run schools or recognize openly the authority of the papacy in many fundamental matters of faith and morals the chinese government also continues to insist as a precondition for establishing diplomatic relations that the vatican cede its role in the selection of bishops to the governmentcontrolled catholic patriotic association a government that purports not to believe in god at all has no business choosing religious leaders the leaders of china consistently seek to position their country as one of the leading nations of the world the chinese people make no secret of their goal to establish their nation as an equal to the united states well leadership brings responsibility religious repression is wrong wherever it occurs and civilized nations rightfully deplore the lack of tolerance found in many backward and regressive societies china however claims to aspire to a higher standard which is why their recent actions are so disturbing china is an ancient nation with a proud history they are the fountainhead of eastern philosophy the birthplace of confucius possibly the greatest secular thinker the world has ever known analects 15 23 of the teaching june 12 2006 of confucius states what you do not want done to yourself do not do to others the early chinese emperors embraced this teaching and china was providing shelter and refuge to nestorian christians when europeans were still burning heretics at the stake unfortunately while religious freedom has been moving forward in western democracies it appears to be on the retreat in china nevertheless china became a signatory to the uniform declaration human rights when they joined the united nations the ordinations that we today condemn are a direct violation of article 18 of the uniform declaration of human rights which states and i quote everyone has the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest this religion or belief in teaching practice worship and observance no one forced china to join the united nations or to ratify the uniform declaration of human rights they did so freely and without coercion indeed the government in beijing worked diligently for many years to displace taiwan as the recognized government of china consequently they now have a responsibility to live up to their standards and their great history proud traditions and u n obligations my resolution calls upon them to do just that i hope that my resolution will focus attention on the advancement of religious freedom not just in china but throughout the world and particularly in our own country thomas jefferson taught us that god who gave us life gave us liberty can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever whatever liberties we may possess whatever privileges we may earn whatever prosperity we may enjoy as individuals or as a nation the most fundamental freedom of all is the right to establish our own relationship with god this is the seminal freedom of all other freedoms that we cherish whenever wherever this core freedom is under assault free people everywhere have a fundamental responsibility to defend it we cannot ignore the suppression of religious freedom in china and expect it to endure in the united states now while we can congress must intrusively and decisively take a stand on behalf of chinese catholics and all others who wish to worship god in a manner and through a confession of their own choosing we must insist that all members of the community of nations respect individual religious freedoms as the condition for mutual respect any nation that interferes with individual religious freedom and the freedom of spiritual communities to order their own affairs to the degree that the chinese government has intervened in catholicism cannot aspire to a place of leadership in the modern world repression is like a cancer left untreated it will grow in size and power until it overwhelms the entire body only by vigorous early intervention can a doctor stop the spread of infection or a free nation prevent the spread of repression if we do not stand with the catholics of china now who will stand with us in the future and if we dont stand with chinese catholics how can we aspire to be a symbol and defender of freedom
