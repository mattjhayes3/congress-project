memorized it at the time another one our ship is sinking our light is going out do not let the bolshevik tide overrun us that was radio free hungary and then it went off the air my wife was as pregnant as you can get with our second child bob junior who was born november 9 1956 a few days later i kissed my 9month pregnant wife goodbye we went down to operations we drew up our maps to fly to seymour johnson air force base in north carolina and then to the azores and then to a nato country and i do not mind saying what country it wasturkey we were going to stage out of there with what was then the worlds best fighter aircraft the soviets had no supersonic aircraft at that time except in a dive these were production straight and level f100 supersabers capable of supersonic straight flight in afterburn we were going to stage out of there and support the hungarian freedom fighters after all we had told them over radio free europe to revolt and we told them for months that under a 5star general and a pretty good president ike eisenhower everything cut loose that month the suez canal was going on britain and france and israel fighting the egyptians and eisenhower had a mild heart attack everything kind of went to heck eisenhowers vice president richard nixon was at the bridge watching the people come across as in the darkness tonight because managua is on chicago time just 1 hour earlier so it is 6 20 dark down there now still in winter and they are now coming across in the drought to low level across the rio cocos river which constitutes more than twothirds of the border between honduras and nicaragua those kids are coming across fording that some of them are wading dragging their compatriots freedom fellow fighters so that scence at the andau bridge is going on right now nixon witnessed that and told me he could never forget that it haunted him we told them to revolt and indicated we would help them and 7 days lateri looked this upi looked up how many members are in this chamber that were here in april 1961 when we did recruit and train and clothe and arm and put on the beach at the bay of pigs another latin fighting force with promises of air cover twentyone members where here including bob michel our leader and our other great leader as great as bob bill broomfield his colleague from michigan our senior man on foreign affairs they were here mo udall missed being here by 13 days that is the cutoff point he won a special election 13 days later but those 21 must have sat here and the house did not have responsibility then that was all a covert operation that had been set up initially under president eisenhower and john f kennedy opted to execute but pulled off the air cover now the words of the beach commander i usd to know his name fernando something his code name was pepe his words on april 19 the day it was all collapsing as two sovietexcuse the freudiantwo cuban given by us t33 jets which had been turned into p80 shooting star fighters because they put the 455caliber machine guns back in the nose our intelligence did not see that even with the best satellites you cannot see what is happening in hangars they were strafing the beach and they had tanks on the bluffs they were raking thesepeople in the crossfire so the beach commander the enrique bermudez of that operation who miraculously survives to this day to tell this horrible story is up to his knees in the surf and he is saying command that is the united states command this is pepe we are in the surf we are engaging in handtohand combat where is the promised air cover my men are being slaughtered do not let us die like dogs in the water give us the air cover where is the air cover and the dilettante nice man but he had a problem with coming to decisions in his life executing them the ambassador up at the u n adlal stevensona littleknown story about mr stevenson as a young boy he picked up a 22 rifle that he and some friends had been dealing with in a wealthy home in the chicago area as young lads they were doing the manual of arms with it and a little 13yearold girl a family friend appeared in the doorway and he inexplicablynobody could figure out kids do strange thingshe picked up the rifle and fired at the young girl and struck her between the eyes killing her dead on the spot without being an amateur psychiatrist people have analyzed for years that that incident which haunted his life a few weeks later as though she were still alive the little girl as though she were still alive in the letters that were found with no mention that he had killed her accidentally a few weeks before some people say that is why he was never able to come to a decision but he was in the u n and called up president kennedy and said how can you embarrass me with this incident he had been clued in on the intelligence operation of trying to liberate the cubans from 30 years of horrors and aids the aids epidemic that they brought back from central africa the killing of black young men and women freedom fighters that they are doingengaged in right now with soviet officers in angola right now that summer offensive is still trailing off with the forces of freedom probably going to win that one or at least fight to a standstill until the next dry season when the soviets will put in more armor more migs and more commanders down to the company and battalion level but with this order of adlai stevenson telling kennedy call off the air cover or i will quit kennedy supposedly a naval officer and a man of action in the south pacific called off the air cover those men were slaughtered i guess the only answer was pepe swim for it baby i do not know how you say that in spanish they started to swim out some of our young coast guardsmen navy men who were driving those landing ships the oldfashioned open type like at tarawa iwo jima with the falp in the front where you hear the bullets hittling tile flap and you are on the other side right before it does down and worrying about whether a bullet is going to catch you in the face some of those men came into the beach and circled under firewe lost some of thoseand tile men that survived that sinking got out and made it to other landing barges and they went out to the coast now what was classified top secret until recently is the unitedstates aircraft carrieri asked tom moorer in our republican study committee hearings if this was all true because he was then commander of the joint chiefs of staff from 1972no he was in a naval assignment he was commander in the pacific later in the seventies he became the chairman of the joint chiefs i said was not the unitedstatess essex not off the coast with the promised air cover he said yes i said did they not have the navy version of the f86 sabres called the fk fury on the decks ready loaded with bombs and bullets to give help to those men on tile beaches yes he said and i said were those planes spraypainted with the american insignias off as though they would be part of this strange covert operation of these mysterious unmarked you know americanprofile jet fighters shooting down the two t33s and buzzing the beach and he said yes absolutely what is also not known by most people in this or the other body is that the alabama national guard played a role in that because they were then flying obsolete b26 dodglas invader bombers they took them off active duty you know you put the resignation down in the bottom drawer of the squadron commander they went to nicaragua and appeared hence this obsession of castro to crush nicaragua and make it communist someday out of nicaragua a long 6 7hour flight to the combat zone these men from the alabama guard flew these older b26s they were to hit and take out the cuban air force on the evening of april 16 to set up the invasion the next day on the 17th they were sharpthey pulled off that raid and they did not catch these t33s with the guns in them making them shooting star fighters then the next day they came back the t33s shot down the alabama guard b26s one of the commanders one of the pilots a colorful character known all through the guard squadrons of the united states at that time because he weighed over 250 pounds was named riley shamberger you could not miss his portly body his body his corpse laid there in the wreckage of his b26 castro went over and put his foot on captain riley shambergers corpse and bragged about his t33s had shot down the one little effort of our air power used on the eve of this bay of pigs tragedy in our history and kennedy said he will never again believe anybody in government he got his answer quickly the next year with the missile crisis of october when nucleartipped missiles were in cuba what is the lesson we ought to learn from that here is the advice and i solicit please your comments what i would have done had i been president kennedy was i would have said look the men are getting slaughtered and if we are not going to give them air cover to try and make a successful beachhead and see if the people will get rid of this communist castro who betrayed his revolution as did he and his brother and the ortega brothers have we must at least give air cover to the rescue operation lets startlets call it a failure and lets extract these cuban lads that we put on the beach the 2506 brigade i will never forget president kennedy in the orange bowl holding up the flag which the survivors begged for years and finally got back from senator ted kennedy and kennedy held up that flag and said someday this banner will fly again over a free cuba holding up the banner that they rescued off the beach in the last terrible moments when we deserted them if i had been president kennedy i would have said extract them give them cover and try to save as many lives as we can because i have decided not to give air cover to the military operation you and i mr burton flew in honduran jets last september september 5 we flew in those little casa 101s one of them had a c47 painted on the side where they had shot down a drug airplane we saw the morale of those pilots the commander navarro who i flew with you flew with one of the young squadron commanders what the gentleman did not see and what i saw on a subsequent trip up at la ceiba on the coast were the ones flying the israeli super mysteres the very planes that turned back the arab attempt to annihilate israel in the lighting war of 1967 those young pilots when i went and walked in if i squinted i would not have told them from americans or british or fighter pilots anywhere in the world those young guys are straining at the bit tonight as we speak to take the few viable super mysteres that are left and go down to that nicaraguan border never penetrate their airspace just defend the sovereign soil of honduras and shoot those an26s and mi17s out of the air and the only reason they are probably not going down there is because president azcona whom we met with the next night and told him of our flying with his great young pilots in the honduran air force is wondering if we are going to follow through are we going to do to honduras what we did to thailand and malaysia pull out of this whole mess and stare down the barrel of this hemisphere and watch the consolidation of another communist country and then duartes fragile democracy begin to unravel as the farabundo marti continue their newly returned urban terror what are we going to do i suggest the least the president can do and i am telling him this through tile television in front of the american people who track this house the very least we should do is unleash the honduran fighter pilots many of them trained in this country their planes reworked up here in texas to keep them flyable these 25yearold frenchbuilt mysteres if we will not unleash them and not get them involved but just back them up that we will protect for example their bases at palmerola and la ceiba if we will not do that much then i think we owe it to ricky bermudez who stood in that hallway when i asked george miller of california to conic out and at least meet the military commander and he says i am not going to meet with any of your thugs dornan we owe it to bcrmudez and his men to maybe violate their airspace not to prosecute with some military operation but to do the minimum that kennedy failed to do and that is to give cover even if it is with our navy airplanes introducing combat americans only in a rescue operation to tell these hondurans lets get out of it we are getting the men out we are getting the nicaraguan kids out of there we are going to give them cover and extract them in amnerciful rescue operation and there would not be ally shooting if we told ortega you win this round you commie you communist you but you had better back off and let us get these kids out of there that we put in there and we will bring them to the united states hopefully to settle them at fort worth in your district jim waights district now what do you think mr burton of at least a rescue operation if we are not going to do anything else

nose at you and the sad thing is you do not even know it please spare us the sophistries about bipartisanship there is no role for the president or the administration in this scenario here the intelligence committee in the house 11 to 6 democrat one vote on the democrat side for the contras is going to be operative force in this that is not bipartisan centuries ago my friends there were people called alchemists who through incantations and formulas tried to change base metal into gold what you have here is an effort at political alchemy whereby with the magic formula of negotiation you are going to change base communists into golden liberal democrats what a glorious time this is may i say to hand over nicaragua to the communists with colombia near chaos being controlled by a cocaine cartel with panama overwhelmed by corruption and a 400mile trip from nicaragua to the canal and you hand over nicaragua to the communists chaos cocaine communism that is the legacy of this sort of legislation the arias peace plan and the speakers plan are based on a fantasy that the sandinistas will do what no communist regime has ever done in history voluntrily yield power these are the same leaders who said what was won by the gun can only be lost by the gun they have also said why would we lose 50 000 lives to surrender the revolution but my friends you have got to understand that many of the most fervent advocates of the speakers plan before us are indiffernt to the takeover of nicaragua by the communists they do not see that as a problem at all all you have to do is to read the democratic study groups letter that they sent to the peace groups where it says and i quote like the refusal to provide more military aid these provisions send a strong message to the contras that our support for their war is over the sooner the contras understand that fact the sooner the fighting will end and the sooner we can begin addressing the real problems of central america of poverty maldistribution of wealth well poverty is a problem communism is not going to fix that maldistribution of wealth is a problem marxism has never fixed that anywhere in this globe but what about a soviet base on the land bridge between texas and the canal that is a matter of blithe indifference to the people pushing this plan at least they do not advert to it in their letter so i just ask them doesnt a soviet base in our hemisphere in addition to cuba bother you it bothers me now the speakers plan achieves the supreme goal of every communist government unilateral disarmament of the resistance meanwhile the sandino communists are arming to the teeth my friends we have had 70 years of experience with the communists with the soviet union do we not learn anything refusal to learn from history goes beyond invincible ignorance i think it approaches what is called congnitive dissonance the refusal to see reality when it bites you in the neck that is precisely what the speakers plan does it is a manipulative cellophane fig leaf it is a search for the lowest common denominator on the left to avoid responsibility for losing nicaragua my friends it takes away much more than it gives it gives a token of beans and bandages and blankets that are undeliverable you cannot deliver them there is no mule train going to carry them into nicaragua you have got to fly them in but if you fly them in you had better have antiradar jamming equipment because the sandinistas have soviet radar and they are not going to let you feed and clothe and bolster the contras except on their terms which are surrender so who are you kidding who are you kidding you are not even going to get the humanitarian aid that you are so proud of in to the people who need it so you are not giving them much but you are taking away much you are taking away their hope this bill is an invitation to a funeral the funeral of freedom i say to you in all sincerity when the last freedom fighter is huddling

conferees for the outstanding work they performed in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience

this legislation"], [3.274247137596831e-05, 3.274247137596831e-05, 0, "hefners daughter was on one of our excellent interview programs the larry king show and i saw the rerun over the weekend and she

shrank back and said oh let him wreck his life but he is wrecking those kids lives we are more graphic in lustful sex exploitation material in 1988 than we were last year or the year before twenty years or so of the sexual revolution has not run its course and one of the ironies i would like to point out to my good friends is that they even tried to use the war in vietnam to push this sexual permissiveness the main battle cry of the war and you can ask any page who was an infant or not even born then what is the most memorable expression that comes out the war and i will help them a little bit and say was it ho ho ho chi minh or hey lbj how many kids have you killed today and they will eventually say i know what it was make love not war of course whether it was woodstock where the young girls were running around naked and young guys that was not just making love we are talking about lust just happenstance encounters like dogs in an alley that make lust just having sex for the celebration of recreational sex in and of itself and then they try to play off against it instead of going off to war as if our young soldiers were over there enjoying the battle that was going on and the irony is as i pointed out earlier we are now seeing more people die at least in the homosexual community because of casual multiple contacts from the public latrines down to the massage parlors and the hot tubs and the clubs that the people hang out in all of these deviant lifestyles and more people are going to die because of lust in the 1980s than died during the decade of the vietnam war by far it was not just a casual little expression thrown out make lust not war it is coming back to haunt us in the worst way i do not believe this member does not believe that we have

crisis to cite one example the subcommittee on oversight and investigations which i chair began looking into the adverse effects of unfair foreign trade practices on our balance of trade as early as 1983 over the next few years we held over 30 hearings in an attempt to understand the growing problem and to capture the attention of the present administration the many other committees involved in this trade legislation have also been working consistently on this issue while the administration seemed unwilling to acknowledge the severity of the problem the congress has responded forcefully and

who have lost their jobs due to imports the omnibus trade bill includes an important provision that would expand the federal governments commitment to workers who have been paying the price for our

would include job training education job search assistance and counseling for dislocated workers over the past decade the manufacturing economy of southeastern wisconsin has been devastated by increasing imports according to the wisconsin department of industry labor and human relations over 50 000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the state between the years 197884 in the years 198087 in

year the chrysler corp announced plans to shut down its stamping and assembly operations in kenosha by the end of the 1988 model year if chrysler goes ahead with its plans 5 500 workers will lose their jobs the kenosha plant first opened in 1902 it is the oldest auto plant in the nation the new worker readjustment program could mean a bigger pot of money available for programs to benefit chrysler workers in kenosha who may be laid off later this year and workers throughout the state who have lost their jobs because of foreign competition another important provision in the trade bill would expand and improve the trade adjustment assistance program this essential program provides training assistance and cash allowances to workers who lose their jobs due to imports currently taa training funds are provided on a cashavailable basis the conference agreement would make this portion of the program into an entitlement with an annual cap on payments of 80 million this provision would ensure that eligible workers receive training funds in the form of cash or a voucher unfortunately the conference agreement does not include the gephardt amendment this provision would have required countries which engage in unfair trade practices and have the biggest trade surpluses with us to reduce their surpluses by 10 percent annually the conferees adopted a much weaker provision

the needs of the military are constantly changing and some bases have outlived their military usefulness current law and the skill of members in fighting the closure of bases in their own districts

republican member of the committee on armed services recognized this problem and introduced h r 4481 the bill before us today the bill was considered and amended by a total of four different committees by the time the bill had been worked over by four committees its original chief sponsor found it had changed almost beyond recognition in his written statement presented to the rules committee yesterday the gentleman from texas mr armeyi stated as follows the bill as it emerged from committee is vastly more complicated than current law and certainly more complicated than the bill as introduced it contains a number of new obstacles to closing bases that will make it even more difficult to achieve savings in this area than it is today because the amended bill is so different from the original proposal the gentleman from texas in a letter signed by a total of 101 members asked the rules committee to make in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute which would be similar to the original bill the rule before you today does that it allows for consideration of the armey substitute because there were so many committees involved the rule makes in order as an original bill a substitute which contains elements reported by each of the committees involved in amending the bill both the new committee substitute and the armey substitute will be open to amendment on the floor a waiver of the germaneness rule is provided for the new committee substitute since it contains congressional review procedures and expedited review procedures which were not in the original bill points of order are also waived against both the committee substitute and the armey substitute because technically they both contain appropriations in a legislative bill the waiver is included because each substitute allows the general services administration to be reimbursed directly from the proceeds of a military base sale for any expenses incurred in selling the property since the money goes directly to the general services administration rather than back into the general treasury and then through the appropriation process to the general services administration technically there is an appropriation on legislation and the waiver is necessary the administration supports house passage of base closings legislation in the form of the armey substitute in lieu of the version recommended by the house armed services and government operations committees the administration supports the armey substitute because it would facilitate an efficient and timely base closure program the administration opposes the armed services government operations version because it requires explicit congressional approval of the base closure package which would likely derail the entire program moreover the armed services government operations version contains several objectional provisions according to the administration particularly in regard to the new economic and environmental requirements and the time during which cost savings must be achieved which in combination would make base closures more rather than less difficult because this rule at least gives the house an

their ranching operations to the area north of the arsenal the lands claim that both the family members and their livestock suffered neurological disorders eventually half of mr lands calves developed symptoms similar to pneumonia and died the surviving cattle suffered teeth damage and did not mature the lands hired a veterinarian who conducted water and diet tests on the cattle and concluded the sickness was caused by poison in the water during the 1970s the army denied responsibility indicating that the contamination was not emanating from rma on october 6 1976 the army sent a letter regarding mr lands claims to the lands attorney samuel l mcclaren the army indicated that no pollution to the area occurred due to government activities the armys 1976 letter was sent several years after the colorado department of health outside the rma boundaries after the cdhs december 1974 and january 1975 tests indicated the presence of cdpd the army notified cdh that tests taken in the

consume i rise in strong support of h r 2707 a bill to reform the disaster relief act and prevent erosion along the great lakes this legislation clearly bears the mark of the public works and transportation committees chairman jim howard ranking republican john paul hammerschmidt and subcommittee chairman henry nowak through their hard work and leadership we are able to bring before you today a truly bipartisan and widely supported bill i also want to commend congressmen tom ridge jim oberstar and bill clinger for their efforts they have certainly been instrumental in mobilizing congress to reform the disaster relief program in addition i would like to thank the other committees for their cooperation in moving this legislation swiftly h r 2707 has three titles title i the disaster relief and emergency assistance amendments of 1988 contains needed reforms to femas disaster relief program it makes very few substantive changes to h r 2707 the bill which congressmen ridge clinger oberstar and i introduced last june and which has received over whelming support title ii the great lakes erosion damage assistance and prevention act of 1988 addresses erosion and flooding problems in the great lakes states due to high lake levels title iii increases the appropriations ceiling for a project in new york harbor to collect and remove drift and debris in july 1987 the water resources subcommittee held an extensive hearing on h r 2707 and possible amendments to the disaster relief act title i of the committee reported bill contains h r 2707 virtually unchanged except for various perfecting amendments and finetuning provisions to reflect the views and comments of emergency management officials the new bill builds upon the strong base of h r 2707 clarifying the federal governments response authorities and financial responsibilities and establishing a stronger partnership among federal state local and private entities it strengthens femas existing program by adding needed uniformity consistency timeliness and above all else fairness in general title i reorganizes the disaster relief program to clearly define presidential authority to respond to major disasters and emergencies major disasters would include primarily natural catastrophes or in certain instances nonnatural catastroplies while emergencies would include any occasion or instance in which federal assistance was necessary the committee however does not intend for emergency declarations to be available in responding to public health problems such as aids epidemics or environmental or nuclear catastrophes for which federal assistance is already available nor do we intend to interfere with existing federal emergency authorities or the comprehensive crime control acts law enforcement emergency assistance provisions perhaps most importantly the bill clarifies cost sharing requirements under the law establishing a minimum federal share of 75 percent for major disaster expenses the bill also details what eligible assistance state and local governments can expect to receive besides improved cost sharing requirements the bill provides greater recognition of hazard mitigation by encouraging measures which would prevent a recurrence of a major disaster or minimize the damages that might be sustained the bill authorizes federal grants for hazard mitiga tion and increases the amounts of money available for disaster prepared ness grants to the states this small increase in federal funding should provide enormous dividends in the future since local governments and even private homeowners will find greater incentives to prevent rather than merely react to disasters the bill also injects greater discipline into the planning procedures of state and local governments by conditioning future federal disaster assistance upon flood insurance requiring floodprone areas to obtain flood insurance and participate in the national flood insurance program should save the federal treasury millions of dollars in the future h r 2707 also makes administrative reforms in response to femas 1986 proposed regulations this legislation contains important provisions on eligibility of communities for federal assistance the date of eligibility and the ability to advance payments and wave cost sharing requirements when necessary we recognize fema should have flexibility in determining threshold questions of eligibility however we do not condone and will not allow arbitrary decisions based solely on sliding scales or mathematical formulas involving population or income h r 2707 will also help to cut the redtape experienced by individuals and state local and private nonprofit entities people should be able to receive assistance when they truly need it and without endless hassles this bill helps ensure that happens without creating a drain on the federal treasury or unnecessarily increasing the federal governments role title ii of h r 2707 establishes within fema a 5year grant program to help the great lakes states prevent or reduce shoreline damages attributable to high lake levels the bill encourages wise shoreline development and environmentally protective responses but steers clear of any kind of federal land use planning the basic message in title ii is we know we cant completely control the lake levels just as we cant control mother nature but we can minimize or prevent future damages by establishing incentives for improved lake shore management and environmentally sensitive development thus title ii conditions federal assistance upon certain state and local activities to receive funding a state must provide a plan for assisting shoreline homeowners and local governments describe present and future efforts and meet 70 percent federal and 30 percent nonfederal cost sharing requirements no funds however can be used in an area where the state or local government does not enforce 30year erosion setback and 100year flood plain requirements frankly i had hoped for even tougher requiremenits such as 50 or 60year setbacks gut to be consistent with newly enacted provisions in the national flood insurance act we have agreed to the 30 year setbacks this is not a federal bailout nor is it a reward to states for previous failure to participate in the national flood insurance program or the coastal zone management program if the great lakes states want federal assistance they should be expected to do their part first they should participate in the coastal zone management program they should adopt tough erosion setback requirements and they should not build in the flood zone title ii also authorizes the corps of engineers to provide emergency assistance to prevent erosion or flooding damage to provide technical assistance to compile and disseminate information on water levels and to demonstrate lowcost methods of damage prevention in addition title ii encourages where feasible the use of natural nonstructural measures to control shoreline erosion this is an important environme tally protective policy and i am proud to support it title ii also encouragesbut does not requirethe use of dredged material for beach nourishment when feasible and mutually acceptable to the parties nothing in this bill however conditions the issuance of a section 10 or section 404 permit on using dredged material for such purposes i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation h r 2707 is timely and important we need to pass it now to continue the road to comprehensive reform in providing

issued by the department of the interior it created some concern among the environmental groups throughout the country the orme dam was objected to which was part of the central arizona project it was objected to by the environmentalists because it was going to flood the fort mcdowell indian reservation and mightthey said it wouldinterfere with the habits of the bald eagle the bandit eagle which nested in that area in 1977 the administration stopped any further consideration of orme dam and in 1978 the central arizona compromise was started to be worked on to work out an alternative to orme dam in 1984 it finally came about the secretary of the interior approved plan 6 which was to not build orme dam but to raise roosevelt dam to raise the stewart mountain dam and to build cliff dam it further provided storage in new waddell dam west of phoenix all of these were to provide water both industrial as well as municipal water for the city of phoenix and flood control in 1985 then the unitedstates wildlife issued their statement that cliff dam would not jeopardize the bald eagle but again found some objection in 1985 suit was filed by audubon society and some other environmental groups this committee has been caught in the middle somewhat when the issue came up again this year the committee agreed if a compromise could be worked out with the delegation in arizona that the committee would go along with it so today the committee does accept this compromise worked out within the delegation from arizona to not build the cliff dam and the lawsuit would be dropped by the

i believe the harsh reality of the drug menace deserves the attention that we are lavishing upon it i am pleased that a particular concern of mine is addressed in the billthat of the laundering of drug money for too long the drug kingpins have been able to stand off from afar and pull the stringsreaping the profits while others pay the price in blood and ruined lives worse yet this money is often cleaned up and then recirculated into otherwse legal enterprises thus the drug lords continue to build their empireslike a large pyramid built on the lives of countless unfortunates it is the height of injustice that these crooks have long gone undetected while we intercept drugs at the border and arrest drug pushers im glad that we are interdicting record amounts of drugs at our borders the improvements in interdiction are commendable and will pay dividends likewise we need to keep after the drug pushers but if we do not go to the source to the drug lords who are pulling the strings and raking in the profitswe will fail in the battle we are fighting until recently it has been nearly impossible to nail the big guys the one very promising avenue we can pursue is to catch them as they try to launder their profits recently we have seen that it can work the money laundering provisions passed in 1986 have already begun to bear fruit they have enabled us to go right to the source operation cchase is the most recent example of how enhanced enforcement procedures can lead to a big payoff in fighting the drug cartels in this case agents were able to go after the bank of credit and commerce international in an effort which netted 87 persons including several highranking members of the medellin cartel this is the most significant money laundering case ever brought by our government but it is only a small part of what we can accomplish if we give the enforcement agents and prosecutors the right tools there are several new money laundering provisions included in this bill which will toughen up the law so that we can keep the pressure on the guys at the top one important improvement is that banks will now be required to transfer information on transactions of over 3 000 to the appropriate federal agencies instead of the previous level of 10 000 up to this point drug dealers have been able to launder large amounts of money by depositing and withdrawing cash just below the 10 000 level in addition two amendments which i sponsored have been included in the bill and will provide commonsense improvements to the process of investigating and prosecuting money laundering drug kingpins in the first case the requirement that notice be given to a subject of an investigation will be waived currently a federal agency can obtain relevant data on a suspected drug dealer from a financial institution without notifying the suspect however if those records are simply transferred to the attorney general the suspect must then be notified this unwarranted notification enables drug dealers to obstruct the investigation in limitless ways or as we have often seen simply flee the united states never to return second an amendment was adopted to modify a imeconsuming and expensive requirement that prosecutors must physically present all documentary evidence to the grand jury sometimes this means actually busing the grand jury to the location at which the records are kept since the volume of the records is simply too large to transport the new provision will still require that such records be presented but if they are too large the prosecutor may provide the jury with a description of the conterits this will greatly help our overworked prosecutors and will also save the government money i would like to note for the record that under the section entitled restrictions on laundering to united states currency that the criteria included in subsection e are intended to identify countries that may be characterized as drug money laundering havens these new moneylaundering provisions are commonsense changes which will be potent weapons in our battle against the merchants of death of course this bill is not the end of the drug story it is

from secretary of defense carlucci he is very concerned about this program i would like to read the letter at this time it says drai mn dickinson last fall as assist ant to the president for national security affairs i was involved in negotiating the socalled budget summit agreement under this agreement the congress and the adninistration adopted an overall framework for budget reduction according to this plan the department of defense was required to reduce its planned program for fy 1989 by 33 billion to 299 5 billion this was well below the level that the administration felt was necessary for our security but in the interest of reducing the overall budget we agreed to accept greater risk in our national security posture since assuming my responsibilities as secretary of defense in november the task of making the very difficult decisions required to meet this agreement fell on my shoulders i cannot overstate how difficult these decisions were they involved cancelling a number of programs delaying others and making reductions in our overall force structure the budget i submitted represented the soundest overall defense program under these difficult budgetary constraints i am gratified that to date the congress has not reduced overall defense spending below the level agreed to in the budget summit agreement however i am very concerned about congressional reductions to a central element of our defense programthe presidents strategic defense initiative sdi program sdi is the cornerstone of our overall defense program it holds the promise of a more stable and effective deterrent posture based on a balance of offense and defense the hopes we had for a more stable and safe deterrent under the abm treaty regime have not been realized the soviet union has continued to modernize and expand both its strategic offensive and defensive forces in an effort to blunt the credibility and effectiveness of our deterrent it is time we recognized this and took the steps necessary to rectify an increasingly unstable situation the case for the sdi program is further strengthened by the disturbing proliferation of ballistic missile technology the administrations request for department of defense sdi activities in fy 1989 is 4 5 billion this figure represents a reduction of 1 7 billion from what we had previcusly planned to spend in fy 1989 i recommended this reduction to our request with considerable reluctar ce us congressional reductions in sdi funding to date have already resulted in substantial delays in the lwogi w n hoever i felt that i had made a conlitnient to present the minimum overall budget requ et thatwhile accepting greatcr risk wsns consistent with our security requ remvnts the request the president submied for the sdi program reflects a balr~ice between our legitimate sccuri~y requirerrnnts and existing budgetary constraints and it is a sound technical program i regret the redections recrnmended by the armned servires committee

strongest po sible terms to oppose any such amendments if the congress sends the president a defense bill that contains a funding level for sdi that is in my view inadequate i would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill while i would make such a recommendation with regret i would not be living up to my responsibilities to the president or the nation if i failed to do so the point is that we came into this budget cycle with a budget summit agreement providing total defense spending of 299 5 billion after this agreement the armed services committee took the funding allotted to us for defense spending went through a series of hearings and came out with recommended funding levels for research and development for procurement for sdi and for other defense functions the committee itself came up with 3 7 billion for sdi to reduce it further i think is reckless is counterproductive and is a breach of faith with the budget summit agreement the amendment that i will offer will be 3 7 billion which is simply a re statement of the committee position restated i would urge the members of the committee not to cut sdi further we have already cut the presidents request of 4 5 billion
