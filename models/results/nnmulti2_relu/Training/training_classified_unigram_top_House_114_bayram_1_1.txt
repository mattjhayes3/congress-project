clarity to this debate today democrats have always believed that innovation is what keeps america number one i think that that is a view that is shared by all of us in the congress our commitment on our side of the aisle i know is to science and to research and development which create jobs launch entire new industries and give the miraculous power to cure for americans to continue to lead in the 21st century for us to meet the challenges of our time for us to secure a strong and sustainable future for americas families and the next generation we must commit to fueling the engines of innovation when president kennedy challenged americans to reach for the moon he reminded us that america must lead in innovation the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we are first and therefore we intend to be first our leadership in science and in industry our hopes for peace and security our obligations to ourselves as well as to others all require us to make this effort however according to the american academy of arts and sciences these days the united states has dropped to 10th place in national r d investment as a percentage of the gdp as their report makes clear unless basic research becomes a higher government priority than it has been in recent decades the potential for fundamental scientific breakthroughs and future technological advances will be severely constrained instead of meeting this urgent need and challenge republicans are coming to the floor of this house today with not one but two bills that do violence to that aspiration first of all we have the socalled republican r d bill a completely unpaidfor permanent and deficitexploding tax extension democrats support the r d tax credit and we will be offering a motion to recommit for a 2year extension to give congressdemocrats and republicanstime to work together to pass comprehensive tax reform that closes loopholes and pays for making this tax credit permanent with this bill alone republicans will explode the deficit by 182 billion this is just a part of a larger package of permanent completely unpaidfor republican tax measures this year that will add almost 600 billion to the deficitover half a trillion dollars added to the deficitincluding this bill their bill to hand 269 billion to the 5 400 richest families in america 5 400 families and their estate tax bill would be getting the benefit of 269 billion paid for by the middle class in our country depriving us of investments in our childrens future the fact is that house republicans have spent this entire congress blowing up the deficit with unpaidfor tax giveaways overwhelmingly tilted toward wealthy special interests my colleagues hear this it is worth noting that this bill on the floor has nothing to do with enterprising startups that are unable to claim the r d tax credit some of you have said to me well we have all these startups in my district by and large they cannot benefit from this bill the way it is written we would like to have written our motion to recommit to go further to do that but the parliamentarians say because you prevent it in your base bill we cant go further this is what is really stunning in the look of it all on the same day as you are saying we are going to do a gotcha bill on r d and challenge you all who support r d not to vote for our approach on the very same daylest anybody think that this is an overwhelming interest in r d on the republican side of the aislerepublicans are bringing to the floor a competes act that completely undermines everything to do with science and innovation in our country it completely upsets our innovation agenda in the 110th congress we put forth the innovation agenda a bill developed in a totally nonpartisan way anna eshoo zoe lofgren and george miller took the lead going across the country getting input nonpartisan input academic input venture capital input technological input into an innovation agenda that innovation agenda really calls for making permanent and modernizing the r d tax credit we see the relationship between science technology innovation and progress to keep america number one with r d tax credits but not done this way as we do here this is a trap in order to keep us from investing in innovation agenda and that was something that bart gordon as chair of the science and technology committee fought for and achieved arpae you know that to name one thing but instead today republicans are bringing a bill that totally does violence to all this i hope members will listen to and support the alternative presented by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson our ranking member on the committee but anyway the original competes act by the democratic congress was supported by an overwhelming number of republicans a majority of the republicans defied their leadership and voted for the competes act in the 110th congress and that original bill passed in a bipartisan way we laid the foundation for new industries that provide jobs for our workers that open new markets for american products that ensure that we continue to rise above the gathering storm norm augustine and others led the way to show what the gathering storm was unless we made those investments in science and technology as i said we created arpae so important this republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did the republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did it is an assault on science and a plan to surrender american leadership on innovation instead of investing in research and development their bill slashes funding for essential initiatives at the national science foundation the national institute of standards and technology the office of science and technology policy the department of energy research it cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy r d by 496 million it is huge halfabilliondollar cut nearly 30 percent below what was appropriated last year it cuts arpae by 140 million 50 percent below the level in the energy and water appropriations bill passed last week most insidiously republicans are attacking science they dont even want to hear just because you dont want to hear it doesnt mean it isnt true in this competes bill that they are presenting they are trying to silence the climate environmental and social science they have consistently tried to ignore the republican bill goes so far as to forbid federal agencies such as epa and ferc from using any research funded or developed by doe a brazen attempt to divorce their decisions from scientific inquiry so again the very idea that on this floor today they come out with this masquerade of r d tax credits 182 billion added to the deficit with the impression that they care about r d r d into what r d into nothing that is about innovation to keep america number one these republican bills represent a perfect manifestation of republican trickledown economics the choice that our country has to make in the economy as we go forward is trickledown economics versus middle class economics trickledown theories have not worked they are what got us in trouble in 2008 and it is exactly what the republicans are trying to take us back to today is one manifestation of that republicans are seeking to ransack our nations investments in the future our commitment to science our commitment to our childrens education our commitment to bigger paychecks and our commitment to better infrastructure for every american family we need to come together in a bipartisan way and that is very possible we did it with the competes act before to pay for r d tax credit extension we need to reject this republican assault on science that will happen later today we need to invest in the future of innovation of our country of hardworking american families we need to reject failed trickledown economic theories and accept that the success of our nation depends on bigger paychecks for americas working families r d tax credits made permanent and modernized are a significant part of that but they are not a part of it if they take us deeper into debt preventing us from making the investments in the future i urge my colleagues to vote no on this fiscally irresponsible r d bill no on their destructive competes act and yes on the proposal made by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson who i thank for her great leadership for keeping america number one"], [9.171938017971115e-07, 9.171938017971115e-07, 0, "i thank mr rothfus my friend from pennsylvania he is exactly right we have so many people across this nation who understand the tragedy of taking a childs life before it is fully born i know there are some people like our friend donald trump who say planned parenthood has done a lot more good but the trouble is so often planned parenthood takes money from the federal government and then just refers the women out of course that has been perpetuated by this administration in its making it sound like planned parenthood does mammograms and other things that they dont do they refer people to other people why not have that money not get held up at planned parenthood why not have that money go directly to the thousands of healthcare providers that actually provide the care that the women are seeking and not have it go to planned parenthood so that they can get money from the government and then keep their abortion business going that also leads right into this article today from the national review jim geraghty regarding obamacare headline deductibles increased in 41 states under obamacare it reads freedom partners unveils a new deductibles tracker showing how much deductibles have increased on average in each state i know this will shock you but most people are finding their deductibles are going up and in some cases way up their analysis shows deductibles have increased in 41 states under obamacarein some states like mississippi by over 1 000 seventeen states representing over half of total exchange enrollment are seeing doubledigit spikes the largest increases were in mississippi which went up 39 percent washington state went up 31 percent south carolina went up 26 percent louisiana went up 24 percent florida went up 23 percent minnesota and vermont went up 22 percent arizona went up 21 percent north carolina went up 20 percent what makes it so incredibly difficult is knowing there are federal dollars that are being used for abortion and being used for purposes that are against the religious beliefs of so many americans when we think that the whole object we were told for having obamacare and passing it against the will of the majority of the american people was so that we could make sure everybody had insurance now it appears that there has not been much change in the net number of people covered under insurance oh yes it is true there are some people who were paying for their insurance who no longer have itthey cant afford it anymore it is true that we have some people who were not paying for it who are having it provided now but it really appears to have been more a transfer of working peoples money to people who were not working it appears that we have been moving into a socialist agenda for some time and that goes back to what president obama said when he first ran telling joe the plumber that he wanted it to be about spreading the wealth around the pilgrims found out that at least in this world if you try to share and share alikethe early new testament tried it and it didnt workand if you start allowing people who are not working to have the same benefits as those who work you will have more and more people who are not working i hear from so many of my constituentsi know i hear from others of my friends here in congressthat constituents are hurting their insurance is costing more and like this article points out the deductibles have gone higher ask one of my staff who is not making very much if you make 30 000 and if you have a deductible of 6 000 as a healthy young person what that basically means is that every dime you are paying into health care is not going to help your health care whatsoever you are paying for the new irs agents the new navigators and the new government union workers who will never spray bactine on anybodys cut who will never put a bandaid on they will just keep adding forms adding requirements taking more time away from the true healthcare providers and more money away from the true healthcare providers for bureaucrats i know back when i was an exchange student in the soviet union and when i went and toured some of the most uptodate facilities in what was the soviet union at the time i thanked god that i lived in america i thanked god that we had such incredible health care and that i didnt have to rely on what appeared to have been 30 or 40yearold antiquated healthcare methods and equipment for my health care even living in the small town of mount pleasant as i did i knew we had a lot better healthcare facilities in my hometown where i was growing up than they did in one of the largest citieswell the largest city in ukrainekiev where i toured facilities i toured a medical school and i couldnt believe how far behind our medical schools that they were it is what happens when you continue moving towards socialized health care i know mr trump initially wanted the government to provide everybodys health care but apparently in his being informed that conservatives dont like that he is now saying no that that is not where he is going we know that president obama back before he was president was caught on video saying that we want to go to single payerin other words socialized medicinewhere the government is in charge of everybodys health care i know i have got conservative friends who say louie we dont have to worry we dont have to fight obamacare because socialized medicine always fails they are wrong socialism always fails as margaret thatcher said eventually you run out of other peoples money you incentivize not working and penalize working and that is what we are doing here in america now we are moving in that direction toward socialism the only time true capitalism true free liberty entrepreneurism in the marketplace fails is when it starts moving into socialist tendencies and adopting socialist ways then that can spell doom for capitalism those who want to have a dictatorial federal national government that is where they want to see things go but it is ironic that when a free market society struggles it is when they start incorporating socialist tendencies and rewarding improper conduct or nonworking then you have a lot more people not working you incentivize people not to hire you penalize people for hiring you penalize people for hiring more than 50 people like obamacare does i have talked to people that still say that they could hire more but they are not going to because of obamacare that means there are people walking around today going from business to business looking for a job that will not find that business that will hire them because of obamacare when you have young people with 5 6 7 000 deductible health insurance they are paying for the bureaucracy they are not paying for health care apparently some religious beliefs dictate against birth control mine doesnt my christian beliefs but i absolutely respect the religious beliefs of those who are against it they should not have to pay for people to violate their religious beliefs that used to be the way this country grew and was blessed by god but as we turn further and further away from what was a blessing to america then the world hurts i have seen it in africa the middle east asia south america when we are not strongas i have said numerous times quoting a south african gentleman when you get weak we suffer please tell people in washington to quit getting weaker we suffer when you are weaker these kind of programs obamacare make us weaker when we provide the resources the ability for the largest supporter of terrorism in the world to have over 100 billion which they say some of it is for sure going to be spent on more terrorism that is the kind of activity that will not be blessed that is the kind of activity that brings a nations demise so health care is costing more deductibles are going up people are paying more for higher deductibles less coverage yes there are some who because of the government subsidies are saying well mines a little less than it was before but the people that are working are paying more and it is devastating it is critical that those of us who have a voice in this city make our voices heard for those in our districts you cant be listening to the talking heads in this town and think you have heard from america i mean look at politico last week they said i had a close race tuesday with one opponent spending tremendously more than i did two opponents i won with 82 percent so that is what politico calls a close race i know that i didnt win with 82 percent because of my looks and certainly not because of the way i sound it is because i make my voice heard for the huge majority of people in east texas with all the common sense they have got that is what i am hearing from them they are outraged that we have allowed obamacare to last as long as it has they are suffering they are outraged that this administration has turned on our friend israel and seeing that iran is rewarded for their massive misconduct as they have continued to be the largest supporter of terrorism in the world with this administration as an accomplice as an enabler there are consequences to nations and governments that enable crime and misconduct and terrorism and abuse for those who believe in the bible it was hosea god was explaining why he was about to come down on the children of israel i love the rather loose translation when he says that it is because they have selected leaders who were not my choice so people around the country can say all they want well this president is not my president this governor is not my governor this person is not my elected representative i dont agree with them but everyone in the country will suffer the consequences of poor choices as leaders that is the way selfgovernment works now i have been reporting from this very podium for years about the misuse and abuse and providing our security by homeland security i am very grateful to judicial watch in their lawsuit against homeland security they have been able to obtain records that verify what some of us have known to be true because of whistleblowers providing us information while some whether cnn and other places belittle what we have said we knew what we were talking about but we couldnt give the sources judicial watch this headline says homeland security records reveal officials ordered terrorist watch list scrubbed it says judicial watch announced today that it obtained 183 pages of documents from the department of homeland security revealing that the obama administration scrubbed the law enforcement agencys terrorist screening database in order to protect what it considered the civil rights of suspected islamic terrorist groups the documents appear to confirm charges that obama administration changes created a massive hands off list removed data from the terrorist watch list could have helped prevent the san bernardino terrorist attack i would also submit that we have seen the emaili believe senator grassley requested more information about it to my knowledge we have not seen additional explanations or information about the email about a persons terrorist ties indication that he was a radical islamist the email response was oh this guys on the secretary of homeland securitys handsoff list we have read stories about the white house allowing at least one or more individuals with terrorist ties to come to the white house there are consequences for ignoring the law ignoring the lawbreakers and not protecting our homeland the article says the new documents were produced in response to a judicial watch february 2015 freedom of information act foia lawsuit filed back on february 13 2015 it should be noted i mean that that is over a year ago the freedom of information act request should have been answered promptly but this administration is too caught up in trying to cover up their own tracks that is why we havent even gotten the attorney general to provide members of congress the documents showing support for terrorism the boxes of documents that were provided to people who were convicted of supporting terrorism the justice department provided it to them i have asked repeatedly and the most i have gotten is reference to a few web sites they covered up their own wrongdoing they have covered up ties to terrorism they have covered up for people who have supported terrorism and there are consequences for that you learn more when you leave this town washington d c but when you have people in africa egypt jordan uae india and afghanistan telling you that your administration in america is supporting violence by not standing up against radical islam and when you hear that from muslim leaders who recognize the failures of this administration then you know that the whole world is seeing what is going on and it is only here that people have become so blind i know there are people in the republican establishment that just cannot believe that a man like trump who has spent his whole life taking one position could be leading so big in different contests and yes my friend ted cruz is doing quite well it is nice to see somebody that has been consistently doing well but around the world they see what is going on the republican establishment doesnt seem to understand people are furious they are furious about obamacare they are furious that we turned on our friend israel they are furious that we have enabled iran to continue their terrorist ways all of this at the same timeof course this wasdonald trumps big issue that shot him to the top is border security this article from today from krwg news border crime taking a toll on residents in southwest new mexico arizona says residents of new mexicos bootheel and parts of southern arizona say human smuggling and drug trafficking is taking its toll on the region the deming headlight reports that residents are scheduled thursday to express their concerns to federal officials during a meeting at the animas community center in animas new mexico judy keeler a longtime resident of the rural border region says her home was recently burglarized and its not an unusual episode for other residents residents have said state highway 80 has become a favorite for mexican cartel drug runners who manage to navigate out of the peloncillo mountains along the arizonanew mexico border they want an even more increased presence from the unitedstates border patrol apparently they are not going to get it we still hear people say there is no way to secure our entire border but this brings back a recollection in history one of my least favorite presidents woodrow wilson secured the border after pancho villa had some of his thugs come across the border and kill american families americans back then with good sense said we cant have that they spurred the president on until he sent tens of thousands of what we call national guard troops now and they secured the border nobody came across our border that we did not want to come across he did it back in the early 1900s and we cant do it now well the truth is we could do it now but you have to have an administration with the will to provide for the common defense of the american people instead we have enabled a massive amount of crime across the border regions that is spilling into other areas of the country drugs are spreading around the country we have heard also from the fbi director himself there are isis cells and there are isis investigations in every state in the union so when are they going to be triggered we know that when they are triggered with reports like we have just read here the administration has continued to cleanse our homeland security records to purge training material for the fbi for intelligence for homeland security so they dont actually learn exactly what radical islam is they dont actually learn the verses in the koran that are relied upon by radical islamists when we do finally have a muslim leader like president sissi in egypt who stands up in front of a room of muslim imams and demands that they take back their region from the radical islamists this administration chooses to try to punish him and not help him like this administration did and wanted to do more for the muslim brotherhood i am tired of hearing from foreign muslim leaders their question why is your country still helping the muslim brotherhood dont they know dont you know the muslim brotherhood has been at war with you since 1979 and you keep helping them well that is the way you lose a country you lose it we have got our choice fiscal irresponsibility which is immoral instead of doing like all preceding generations in this country which have always had as their theme we want to make our country better for our children than we had it now we have gone through a couple of generations who have said you know what forget the future generations we want future generations money spent on us now fifty years ago seventyfive years ago one hundred years ago even when cars were first invented you would not have seen a bumper sticker like is not uncommon today retired persons say we are spending our childrens inheritance you wouldnt see that because they wanted to make the country better than they had it i know you personally and you and i and our colleagues we talk about it we have talked about it todayheated conference because we want a better country even than we have had with more opportunity more freedoms as we see freedom slipping away adam kredo has a story here the flow of illegal immigrant children into the united states is expected to rise to recordbreaking numbers in 2016 as deportations decrease according to leading members of the senates judiciary committee at least 20 455 unaccompanied minors have been caught during fiscal year 2016 along the unitedstates mexico border as of last month according to committee chairman senator chuck grassley who warned that if this trend continues the number of illegal minors could eclipse a massive 2014 surge that strained the resources of the department of homeland security and prompted investigations into the obama administrations handling of the issue now one of many problems is you have people that are coming to america because there are more opportunities here which begs the question why are there more opportunities here than there are in their home country when you analyze the situation what you find is the reason they dont have businesses booming in their home country is because of graft or corruption or a corrupt government or a dictatorship because as the old saying goes capital is a coward money to capitalize or invest always goes to where it feels safestthat is why it is capital is a coward and it is not very safe in countries where the government is corrupt the rule of law is not applied across the board and the laws are not enforced across the board one of the great ironies in the world right now is that people are leaving countries where there is violence and the rule of law is not enforced they are coming to america where for most of our history we have done a better job than most any country ever in enforcing the law across the board once here illegally those same people are saying now that we are here we want you not to enforce the law across the board we want you to ignore your law on immigration and law on becoming citizens ignore it if we do that it will make us like the corrupt countries they came from and make us a land of no opportunity where people will have to go to some other country where they enforce the law i have had even members of congress say well if it all goes bad we will all pack up and head to australia but i was talking to some people from australia this year and i mentioned that to them and they didnt laugh they looked very somber they said you know if something happens to the united states you are not going to be coming to australia because china will take us over like that if the united states is not standing strong they said our country australia will be gone china would grab us up in a heartbeat it is important that america stand strong you cant stand strong when you are financially bankrupt you cant stand strong when you are morally bankrupt we seem to have our choice of ways we could meet our demise our military is being degraded under this administration the navy going back to its size back inwas it the early 1900s before world war i weakness is provocative i havent heard anybody else notice maybe there is no correlation maybe there is it seems historically from my study of history that when a nations enemy sees that nations biggest friend pulling away and not being as good a friend then that enemy is provoked to attack but it was in may of 2010 when this administration sided with israels enemies in demanding that israel disclose all their weapons systems including any potential nukes i was shocked by that the united states had never sided with all of israels enemies like that before i thought about the bible story of king hezekiah when the babylonian leaders had come to visit and schmoozed with him and isaiah asked him what have you done with the babylonian leaders of course this is a texas paraphrased version but he bragged about i have taken them and shown them all of our treasure the most literal translation from the hebrew says and i showed them all the defenses we have in our arsenal our armory isaiah explained you are going to lose the country you dont show your enemyyou dont even show your friendsall of your defenses and yet we were demanding that of israel within 48 hours israels enemies launched a flotilla to go challenge the lawful blockade of the gaza strip all that israel was doing was trying to prevent more rockets from going in because the rockets were being launched at them every daytotally legal they were trying to defend themselves against rocket attacks and created a terrible situation at the blockade but as america continues to help fund irans desire to support terrorism and as this administration has turned its back on nations like nigeria ethiopia kenya i hear from leaders in those countries where they say you know all we wanted was a little help against our enemy of course in nigeria having been there and having met with so many of the parents of girls who were kidnapped by boko haram radical islamists we then hear that our administration here says oh yeah we will give you some help but you have got to change your religious beliefs you have got to change your laws so it supports samesex marriage and you fund abortion and then we will give you more help the president in kenya basically said at a news conference in effect you take care of your country you are not going to come tell us what our religious beliefs and laws should be as a nigerian catholic bishop stated our religious beliefs are not for salenot to president obama not to anybody but there are consequences in world history when one nation tries to destroy the religious beliefs of another countrytheir closely firmly held religious beliefs there are consequences when a nation forgets to say thank you god for all of our blessings thank you god for protecting us thank you for allowing us to live in the greatest country a country in which there is more opportunity more assets per person than anywhere in the world this is the one country where the number one health problem for our nations poor is obesity it is a terrible problem that we need to deal with but where in history do you have a country where the nations poor have as their number one health problem obesity this nation has been blessed beyond anything that people could have ever dreamed when this nation was founded but the founders did see one thing they saw the threat of giving more and more power to a federal government i was fortunate to call justice scalia a friend a group of seniors from my hometown of tyler texas from my church green acres baptist came up to washington d c they said hey you are supposed to be friends with justice scalia we would love to meet him that is one thing we really want to do in washington so i called over and justice scalia bless his heart he said sure come on over so they arranged it we had the meeting he walks in they are all seated there the seniors from my church and justice scalia could be very talkative i treasure meals with him exchanging jokes and stories it made you feel good about the world he walks in and leans up against the table at the front so you want to meet me what is your question what questions have you got it kind of took them by surprise one said do you think we are the freest nation in history because of our bill of rights justice scalia in his inimitable style said oh gosh no no the soviet union had a better bill of rights than we did i had forgotten i made an a on a paper in college that i did about the bill of rights and the constitution of the soviet union yeah they were promised all kinds of rights but the government was given the power to erode all of the rights that were said to be protected he said no the reason that we are the freest country in history is because our founders did not trust government and so they wanted to make it as hard as possible to pass laws see the founders thought that gridlock was a blessing gridlock was a great thing because it meant that as people anticipated passing laws it would be tough because many laws regulate what you can and cant do the more laws you pass just as this administration has shown the american people as it has set alltime records for the most pages of regulationsthere are over 79 000 new pages of regulations every year how can anybody make a living with that kind of regulation coming out year after year certainly for the last 7 incredible the founders knew that they wanted to make it hard for any governmental agency any government bureaucracy to create laws that took away freedom because they had some libertarian tendencies justice scalia said so they wanted it hard to pass laws so what do they do they create a legislature with two houses and certainly that was part of the compromise but in england the house of lords is not particularly powerful but they wanted both houses with the power to stop what the other one was doing they wanted it very difficult in one house to pass a law i think they would cringe if they saw all the bills that are just passed with unanimous consent or on suspension that we do more and more and more because they wanted it tough to pass laws i have friends say you guys should be in session more often i say you dont know what you are asking for because every day we are in session we pass some new bill we pass some new law many of those laws take away freedoms of americans the founders knew that that is why justice scalia said they created two houses if one house got a law through it the other one could stop it cold but that wasnt enough to protect our freedom we want an executive but not one like a prime minister the prime minister is elected by the legislature we dont want that we want it tough we want independence so we are going to have a chief executive a president that is elected totally separate from the legislature even if the house and senate finally agree on something we will give him the power to just say no i am not going to let it happen but that is not enough we want more gridlock so lets create a judicial branch as they did in article iii that could turn around and say no the house senate and the president may have agreed but we dont agree it is not consistent with the constitution justice scalia said that is why we are the freest nation in history because our founders did not trust government so it concerns me when i see voters begin to think that our hope is going to arrive on air force one one of my greatest thrills was becoming friends with chuck colson as chuck colson said our hope will not arrive on air force one the old saying the axiom is true democracy ensures a people are governed no better than they deserve if you want a good president you have got to be a good country an immoral country is not going to elect a great leader they are going to elect an immoral leader when you see christians who believe that the only way to the saving grace of jesus is to ask for forgiveness and as the bible says believe in the lord jesus christ and you will be saved it is amazing to see christian leaders saying they are going to put their faith in a guy that says he has never had to ask for forgiveness but that was modified later to well i dont think gods concerned with trivial things like that if i were god i wouldnt be but thank god i am not god he seems to care about every individual if you believe the bible that is what it says and then if there is not enough bad news this comes from kpnx today attorney general report possible smuggling trail between the middle east and arizona border we have talked about that before long before the attorney general indicated that there appeared to be a trail between the middle east and the arizona border we have this story this week from stephen dinan from the washington times top border chief to agents who object to obama amnesty look for another job there you are when the head of the border agency says they are not going to enforce the laws that exist then one of two things either that is what the country deserves because it has become immoral and lawless or the country rises up and says we will never have another administration like this as long as we are alive we are going to make sure we have an administration that enforces the law no matter who it is apparently since people govern no better than they deserve we now find out that hillarys highly paid it guru at the state department had no actual national security experience so apparently we elected an administration that ensured people were governed no better than they deserve and apparently they felt like we didnt deserve a state department with national security experience is it any wonderi thank godthat there have been more benghazis under that kind of attitude one was too many we see yesterday that the justice department grants immunity to the staffer who set up the clinton email server i have been a prosecutor i have been a judge i have been a chief justice when someone grants immunity they are closing in on a prosecution that is the intent you dont grant immunity to someone and someone doesnt normally seek immunity unless they are concerned that they may have violated the law they seek immunity because they violated the law immunity is granted when with the prosecution the investigatorsin this case the fbifeel that laws are being violated so we are going to grant immunity to this person so that we can get the person further up but i still maintain that as long as hillary clinton does not condemn or expose the obama administration to any of the truth about what went on in benghazi and about the handsoff list of terrorists and homeland security i do not see her getting indicted it is a good insurance policy another article from the new york times as campaign unfolds so do inquiries into hillary clintons emails so many voters dont seem to care why because people are governed no better than they deserve if they are more concerned about themselves than their children they are going to get what they deserve well we had mitt romney come out today just before we voted condemning donald trump as phony and a fraud everybody knows that people across this country are furious with the establishment so if that idea was donald trumpsto get mitt romney to come out and condemn himit was a brilliant plan because that is like asking mary levy to tell you how to win the super bowl after he lost four of them in any event this country is in grave danger i was all over the 12 counties that i represent this country has so many great citizens they deserve better than what they are getting i hope and pray the majority in the country will wake up and see the dangers to our own national defense to our own national security from government intrusions into our private lives from drugs that are coming in through mexico and from terrorists that are coming into this country the fbi director himself says we have got them in every state we are in big trouble it is time the american people woke up and said as our parents did we dont care what has happened before we are going to

presidentsi started to say his executive order but actually in the case of his majestys program on amnesty there actually was no executive order that was signed by the president like you find in a lot of countries around the world where there is a dictator there was a speech made and comments made by the ruler then the secretary of homeland securityin our case secretary johnsonwrote a series of memos to carry out the dictation from on high and they overrode the laws that were duly passed by both houses of congress and by previous presidents that is where we run into some trouble that is where you run into trouble in doing what benjamin franklin suggested might be possible to undo as we know a lady asked him at the constitutional convention what did you give us and he said a republic madam if you can keep it one of the ways you do not keep representative governmentselfgovernment through the electing of representatives to do the will of the peopleis to go and have those elections and elect people who pass lawsi mean the founders wanted government to have gridlock as i mentioned before justice scalia in talking to a group of 50 or so senior citizens from my district explained that the reason we are the freest country in historyor at least we used to be the indicators indicate we are not the freest country anymore but the reason we became for a while there the freest country in history was that the founders did not trust government they knew that if it were too easy for a government to make laws or to just dictate what would happen in a country then people would not be free they pledged their lives liberty sacred honorthey pledged everything manymost actuallyof the signers of the declaration of independence did not have very pleasant lives after the signing of that many lost their treasures their fortunes they never lost their sacred honor they pledged it and they never lost their sacred honor when you look at all of the sacrifices that were made to try to allow us to have representative selfgovernmentand as difficult as it is to pass a bill here in the house and have the senate pass the same bill or a similar bill and if they are not the same to go to conference and try to work out a bill that is the same and get it passed in both houses and send it to the president and get the president to sign it and have the supreme court say yes that it is consistent with the constitutionthat is very difficult all of those things have happened with regard to our immigration law that the president talked about as any good ruler would and of course as any good ruler he had a secretary of homeland security who did memos and said okay we are going to just not pay any attention to that law here is the new law i was amazed to hear all of the major networks including fox news talk about here is the new program here is the new plan after memos were concocted that overrode the laws that were duly passed in the house and senate and signed previously by the president who just overrode the law and said we are not going to do that we have in their opinion the discretion to just ignore the law and do what we want there is a good article out of the hoover institution journal written by michael mcconnell it just came out on april 15 i thought it did a good job of discussing these issues that are coming up before the supreme court on monday also by way of further preface the decision originated in the southern district of texas before united states district judge andrew hanen who happened to be one of the smartest people in his class and actually going through law school one of the more liberal people in our class in law school but a brilliant guy the more he delved into issues the better lawyer he became he was with one of the best firms in houston he has become a profoundly good arbitrator of justice as a united states judge so judge hanen wrote a very lengthy order in which he enjoined in carrying out the wishes that were dictated by the secretary of homeland security because they violate the law they say we are ignoring the law and the judge could see that there are massive consequences although right here in this very room the president said that we are not going to cover people that are illegally in the country with his obamacare it turns out that that wasnt true we have apparently massive numbers who get the income tax credit whether legally or not i have people constantly telling me they work for different income tax services and they provide services to people that dont have social security numbers that are legitimate they all know about the earned income tax credit and they all want it on there they all claim it whether they can tell you where their kids are or not they want that credit there has been some massive projections of just how much in millions or billions is being paid out we previously had reporting about just in one little community how numerous people claim to live in one home and claim to have as many as 30 kids or so in that home so they could claim all those earned income tax credits so they could get a big refund there is massive amounts of money that is being taken from those who earned it and given to those who have come into the country illegally i dont have the articles in front of me there are articles out this week talking about that actually by more than the current unemployment rateeven the real rate not the one that is just made upit doesnt include the 94 million or so who are eligible to work have tried to find work and given up trying to find work but either number you care to use we have that percentage of people who have immigrated to america thank god for legal immigration perhaps one in six people working in america are firstgeneration immigrants that is great but the trouble is that a huge portion of those are illegally in the country the president can say all he wants to well they are doing jobs that americans wont do when wages are lower that are being paid to americans looking for work and working it affects their homes it has affected their standard of living it has caused people to be unemployed who would be employed if they werent competing with people that took lower wages because they are here illegally of course yesterday we learned that the irs commissioner the head of the irs koskinen is an accomplice he has been complicit in the use of stolen illegal social security numbers because he says it is okay if they use stolen social security numbers for a good basis we just dont want them to use it for a bad basis apparently for him somebody filing a perjured and fraudulent income tax return and getting a refund of money that they very well may not be entitled to at all and should not be entitled to is one of the good purposes he clearly needs to be impeached and removed from office as head of the internal revenue service hopefully that will be happening in the near future there has to be consequences for violating the law for helping others violate the law by looking the other way and announcing you are looking the other way while people violate the law america is in trouble we could very well be greece right now if it werent for the united states having the dollars the international currency and having our ability to print our own money neither of which greece has this case being taken up on monday by the supreme court has the ability to basically make congress a nullity by saying you know whatlook the president was elected 8 years ago and 4 years ago so if he wants to just ignore laws and do what he wants that is not according to the law shouldnt that be okay it is incredible how some even who have advanced degrees are so uneducated on how you keep a republic well michael mcconnell says one of the most closely watched cases before the supreme court this term is united states v texas the immigration case that is scheduled to be argued on april 18 the supreme court surprised most observers when it asked the parties in that case to address a question they did not raise in their briefs whether president obamas deferred action for parents of americans dapa order violates the take care clause of article ii of the constitution the take care clause has never before been enforced by the court and most people have probably never heard of it let me insert here my dear friend from florida congressman ted yoho has been advocating for some time we pass a bill that just sets out an enabling statute that says what take care means under the constitution and sets some requirements out so we actually have some hard requirements against which to measure a presidents performance in order to determine whether he has violated the take care clause and ought to be removed from office before you can determine the latter you really need to know has the take care clause been violated to a level that would justify high crimes and misdemeanors i appreciate so much andrew mccarthys book regarding impeachment where he lays out really impeachment was intended to be a political issue the founders did not want impeachment to be like a criminal case where the prosecution has to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt it is a mechanism by which we avoid revolutions and military coups which have happened in countries around the world here we have not had to have ever thank god a military coup or another revolution since 1776 we have had massive movements for which we are grateful like the abolitionist movement that got rid of the atrocity of slavery led mainly by christian churches and the civil rights movement of course which the ultimate leader was reverend martin luther king jr an ordained christian minister so these movements have not required revolution have not required a military coup because the founders created something called impeachment according to andrews bookand im sorry i cant do it the justice it deservesbasically impeachment is a political mechanism to allow people to remove from office someone who may not have violated a criminal statute beyond a reasonable doubt but more than half of the countrymore than half of those representatives elected in the country believe that he should be removed then we avoid a revolution a coup those kinds of things this article from the hoover institute goes on dapa is a set of executive branch directives giving some four million illegal aliens who have given birth to children in the united states what the orders call legal presence even though they are here in violation of the law this legal presence entitles dapa beneficiaries to work permits a picture id drivers licenses social security earned income tax credits medicaid obamacare and other social welfare benefits until the 2014 election president obama repeatedly and emphatically stated that he did not have authority to issue such an order without congressional action then when he didnt like the results of the election he went ahead and did it anyway he had said i am not a monarch i cant just do these things and when he didnt like the result of the election he decided to go ahead and be a monarch and do them anyway the article goes on twentysix states have sued the federal government to challenge the legality of dapa the courts below held that the orders violate the administrative procedure act because they were issued without public notice and comment as is required for agency actions with the effect of law and because they are in violation of the underlying statute the immigration and nationality act ina by adding the take care clause to the questions presented the court is taking care that the constitutional dimensions of this case will not be swamped by the administrative law details but for most people including most lawyers the take care clause is a great unknownuncharted territory so what is the take care clause and what does it mean the take care clause found in article ii of the constitution the executive power article is comprised of only nine words the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed but an understanding of those nine words requires an appreciation of their roots in english history like many other structural features of the united states constitution the take care clause derives from the long struggle between parliament and the crown over the extent of prerogative powers that is the monarchs asserted powers to create laws or otherwise to act unilaterally absolute monarchs rule by whim what they say goes even before parliament existed however the barons of england insisted that monarchs rule in accordance with law rather than mere executive whim or decree king john 11991216 ad was a major offender against the rule of law he arbitrarily increased taxes abused the kings court mustered soldiers for military misadventures foreign and domestic and hanged innocents in wales things came to a head in 1215 at runnymede faced with armed insurrection john agreed to the great charter which established the principle that the king is not a law unto himself even the king must act through settled law to bind his subjects thus began a centurieslong struggle between law and royal prerogative the term prerogative refers to powers invested in the executive that are not governed by law john locke who was read by so many of our founders and discussed during our nations founding john locke defined the term in his second treatise on government john locke said this this power to act according to discretion for the public good without the prescription of the law and sometimes even against it is that which is called prerogative the kings prerogative powers included the veto the pardon the powers of war and peace the power to create and fill public offices and the power to dissolve the parliament all these he could do without the need for statutes passed by parliament and statutes passed by parliament could not touch limit or regulate these prerogative powers prerogative powers are not all inconsistent with constitutional government under the constitution for example the president has certain defined prerogatives such as the pardon power and the veto which are committed to the presidents discretion of course we know the prerogative of veto can be overridden by congress so it is not an ultimate prerogative but much of constitutionalism consists of replacing prerogative with law the framers of the unitedstates constitution carefully reflected on the various prerogative powers claimed or exercised by the english king and granted denied or limited those powers when creating the article ii executive now the early controversies over prerogative powers left that one of the most dangerous prerogative powers asserted by english monarchs was the proclamation power that is the power to create new law without parliamentary approval the term modern americans would use for proclamations is executive orders disputes over the proclamation power came to the fore during the tudor dynasty which was 1485 to 1603 henry viii believed his royal proclamations should have the force of law as though they were made by act of parliament the great 18th century historian and philosopher david hume later called this a total subversion of the english constitution after henrys death parliament repealed the act of proclamations the struggle over prerogative accelerated under the four stuart kings prior to the glorious revolution of 1688 james i was an ardent believer in the divine right of kings he wrote a book on the topic shortly before he ascended to the english throne called the trew law of free monarchies in james is view kings are unrestrained by law their authority comes from god and therefore the king is accountable only to godnever to man or law in 1610 james i issued a royal proclamation prohibiting new buildings in and around london and the making of starch of wheat the legality of these orders was tested in case of proclamations lord ellesmere the royalist jurist argued that the courts should maintain the power and prerogative of the king and that in cases in which there is no authority and precedent the judges should leave it to the king to order it according to his wisdom chief justice cokewhose whiggish constitutionalism later informed the views of american framersheld that the king could not lawfully change any part of the common law nor create any offense by his proclamation which was not an offense before without parliament coke concluded the law of england is divided into three parts common law statute law and custom but the kings proclamation is none of them chief justice coke reiterated the point in the case of non obstante or dispensing power coke observed that the king does have some prerogative powers for example a royal pardon grants mercy notwithstandingor as english lawyers said at the time non obstantethe lawful conviction but coke insisted that the kings non obstante or dispensing power never can be used to annul statutes if the king attempted to dispense with a statute coke held the kings effort would be void for an act of parliament may absolutely bind the king parenthetically of course since our laws were derived through this knowledge of what was done here the framers believed that the law would absolutely bind the king that lives in the white house the principles of the case of proclamations and the case of non obstante are part of the american constitutional tradition the steel seizure case of 1952 our supreme courts foundational separationofpowers decision held that the president cannot make law that is exclusively congress job in other words executive orders have the force of law only when implementing statutes treaties and the constitution notably many if not all of these controversies over the reach of royal prerogative arose when the king took a precedent that prior monarchs had used in modest and relatively uncontroversial waysas elizabeth had funded defense against the spanish armadaand stretched it to cover significant usurpations of power in ways contrary to the will of parliament that has continued to be the pattern in american separation of powers struggles including the one over dapa it is a very good article that goes on and discusses other concepts but dan stein had a good article regarding why united states v texas is the most important case the court will decide this year according to stein the supreme court has decided to review certain elements in united states v texas he goes further than that he says the most dramatic of these actions were two programs designed to grant de facto amnesty and work authorization to an estimated 4 7 million illegal aliens the first of these amnesties was an expansion of deferred action for childhood arrivals or dacaa 2012 executive action that has thus far benefited some 800 000 illegal aliens who arrived in the unitedstates when they were under the age of 16 or at least i will add parenthetically based on what i have observed at the border who said they were under 16 i have been there all hours of the day and night on the border and have been astonished beyond mildly being amused that people who clearly could grow full beards would claim to be under 16 i have seen them in the middle of the night when a group of them would have to go through being processed by the border patrol reading their little pieces of paper they had and exchanging and then each of them showing this is what i have for identification purposes i was amused how their identities seemed to be interchangeable because they could pass them among each other and decide which identity each wanted to take but this article points out that unitedstates district judge andrew hanen issued a temporary injunction halting implementation that injunction was subsequently upheld by the unitedstates court of appeals for the fifth circuit the obama administration appealed that decision to the supreme court and they will hear arguments that will be on monday while hanens injunction was based on the governments failure to comply with the requirements of the administrative procedure act the high court has indicated that it will also consider whether the executive amnesty programs violate the take care clause of the constitution i also want to insert here since i know the intellectual integrity and brilliance of judge andrew haneni have not talked to him in a number of years but when i read the order that he drafted he could have just had a onepage oneparagraph order implementing in the injunction but it was lengthy and thorough and i knew what judge hanen was doing having been a judge and chief justice i understood exactly there are times when you dont want the lawyers as smart as they may be to misinterpret the actions you have taken and you know that you are capable of writing a good law review article as judge hanen was more than capable and by himself has won an award for a law review article i knew as a judge what i suspected judge hanen felt in this case this could end up before the supreme court and i dont want any misunderstanding or some court coming back down the way that says oh i probably meant this or i intended to do that when that was not my meaning and it was not my intent so judge hanen issued a very eloquent and lengthy order so that even some of the normal majority of the unitedstates supreme court would have to really twist and abuse his words in order to get the wrong meaning of what he was doing he laid out his legal basis he laid out the facts and he made very clear that both the law and the facts supported what he did and the reasons for which he did them so it should be a lesson i know as a judge often it is easier when a litigant prevailing litigantthe way it usually goes they supply an order with their motion with their petition for injunction here is the order and it is a lot easier for a judge just to sign that and go on but on important matters i hope other judges who truly appreciate the constitution the way judge hanen does will take the time to write their own order as he did and scrupulously so and i certainly hope that come monday during and after oral arguments in this case the justices on the supreme court some of whom may not be quite as smart as judge hanen intellectually will at least give credence to the trouble that he endured in order to write his own order and make sure his legal reasoning was as clear as judge hanen made it well done good and faithful judge hanen 1230 this article says under these two newly announced programs talking about dapa and daca nearly 40 percent of the nations estimated 12 million illegal aliens would be granted legal presence and permission to work in the unitedstates according to an analysis by the migration policy institute an organization that is generally supportive of president obamas immigration policies combined with the 40 percent of illegal aliens covered by daca daca and dapa the other policy directives issued by secretary johnson would have exempted 87 percent of all illegal aliens from enforcement actions that is extraordinary if the president doesnt like the law he says i have the power to exclude certain people from prosecution and hey i can issue pardons in specific cases so i am specifically making 87 percent of those illegally in the country legal we might as well pronounce the next president king or queen if they are going to have this kind of power further down in the article mr stein says to the contrary congress has taken explicit actions to limit the discretionary authority of the executive in the area of immigration enforcement in the illegal immigration reform and relief act of 1996 which congress passed and president clinton signed congress indisputably intended to prevent delay in the removal of illegal aliens under the ina congress has enumerated two mandatory statutory responsibilities to the secretary of homeland security the power and duty to administer and enforce all laws relating to immigration and the mandatory duty to guard against the illegal entry of aliens under the obama administration neither secretary johnson nor his predecessor janet napolitano have faithfully complied with these statutory responsibilities in fact through his acts of november 20 2014 the secretary has affirmatively shirked those responsibilities and blatantly attempted to substitute presidential policies in the place of a comprehensive system of constitutionally enacted federal laws that define who may enter and remain in the united states and under what conditions needless to say when the supreme court delivers its ruling in june the implications for unitedstates immigration policy will be profound what is at stake is nothing less than the entire premise of more than a century of immigration policy namely the legitimacy of laws that restrict immigration in order to protect the social economic and security interests of the american people let me insert here lets look at who is most harmed by these vast amnesty programs of millions of millions of people to compete with people legally in america for the jobs you have got over 94 million americans that are so tired of looking for work and being turned down for jobs they quit looking perhaps some of those 94 million should be given the chance to have those jobs and of course knowing the way free markets are supposed to work labor is paid what the free market would require but you convolute the free market by bringing people in and i do say bringing them in because homeland security as border patrolmen have told me are called logistics by the drug cartels because they get them across the river and then homeland security becomes logistics and ships them wherever they want to go in the united states or they may be so callous as to just give them a notice whether they are a killer as has happened here lately and say by the way come back to court some time in the future for which they of course do not return but in any event the article concludes even those justices of the court who might agree with the presidents views on immigration policy generally should appreciate the precedentsetting decision they would be making by allowing the president to run roughshod over the constitutional separationofpowers doctrine those who support granting amnesty to illegal aliens should recognize that a ruling in favor of his vast new claims to power to change the law would be a pyrrhic victory it would emasculate the abilities of congress to set immigration limits and standards and it would render the courts irrelevant in ensuring the enforcement of the very same so this is a big case coming up the supreme court also has heard oral arguments on whether or not the president can order the violation of deeply held religious christian convictions and order folks like the little sisters of the poor who have dedicated their lives to poverty and helping those less fortunate if they want them to violate their religious convictions as was made clear during oral argument then the administration ought to be able to order any american including churches according to them to violate their christian beliefs because after all they are the government they work for the president sure they can order people to violate their christian beliefs for heavens sake these people have no sense of history they dont even know that one of the things that just infuriated americans and caused a revolution was a king believing that he could just order people to violate their religious convictions that is why religion is the first thing mentioned in our bill of rights it has been so misconstrued but the government was to never do what the king of england did when he ordered a new church the church of england is the official church they never saw it as a problem to have different denominations agree to pray in the name of jesus and to have the same type of prayers begin each day in the congress and then again when we started our first congresses under the constitution that was never a problem they knew they were not violating the first amendment because many of them helped craft it we are not establishing a religion and we are not going to prohibit the free exercise thereof so the court has this before it with eight justices sitting after the untimely death of a real american hero who has no doubt already heard as john quincy adams said when he stood downstairs before the supreme court and prayed that the justices of the supreme court that have already deceased would have already heard those words well done good and faithful servant enter now into the joy of the lord that is what john quincy adams said specifically before the supreme court in the hearing on the amistad case downstairs when the supreme court was here in this building i have no doubt justice scalia has already heard that he has been a very faithful servant standing up for religious liberty so we will see what the other eight justices do and then we will see whether or not politics has become so extraordinarily the purpose of the supreme court rather than the constitution because clearly there is information that is passed and gotten to the supreme court apparently it occurred during the decision on whether or not to extend the 24hour hold on the bankruptcy order that violated the constitution and god bless justice ginsburg when she put that 24hour hold on an unconstitutional illegal order according to what one of the justices told mewithout going into detailthe white house submitted information ex parte behind the scenes that if they left that 24hour hold in place everybody that had any kind of job that related to the automobile industry would lose their job and it would all be the supreme courts fault if they left the 24hour hold in place it certainly appears they got information that affected chief justice roberts it looked like he changed a dissenting opinion into a majority opinion in the obamacare case this is serious and this will determine whether or not we are going to follow the constitution i am so pleased to be here on the house floor with my friend from south carolina the former governor"], [1.1920928955078125e-06, 0.9999988079071045, 1, "mr chair let me thank our ranking member congresswoman mccollum for yielding and for her tremendous leadership of

"last week congress concluded with a spotlight on gun safety and the yawning chasm between the attitudes of the republicancontrolled congress and the needs and desires of the american people why should america be the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence obviously there are no simple solutions in a nation where there is a gun for every adult where a halfdozen people have been killed in recent years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to embark on a similar crusade to reduce gun violence the members who took to the floor over 24 hours showed a powerful expression of policy and emotion that used to be seen on the floor of this house but is sadly seldom in evidence today but it is not too late congress should do its part to at least allow the

judge i was bothered when people would be nominated for a federal bench and they wouldnt get their hearing or perhaps like a gentleman named bork a gentleman named clarence thomas they got a hearing but as justice thomas properly stated back at the time it wasnt so much a hearing as it was a hightech lynching i am sure all of us have our own personal stories that we are personally aware of i just happen to be one of 435 who have personal knowledge of personal friendspeople who were imminently qualified and were eventually confirmed one of them was my law school colleague and we served in the same firm together for a few years leonard e davis he was nominated in 1992 and yes as my friends across the aisle point out it was the last of 4 years of the george h w bush term but there was no reason not to give him a hearing the guy had been editor of the baylor law review a brilliant guy engineer by undergraduate training and it is really unfortunate but not only did he not get a hearing in 1992 not only did the senate democrats drag their feet and refuse to give him a hearing in 1992 he had to wait 10 years for a hearing to become a federal judge because the senate democrats refused to give him the hearing he deserved and the vote that he deserved so he was nominated in 1992 and in 2002actually may 9 of 2002he was finally confirmed as a federal judge now another law school classmate colleague was with one of the best firms in houston he and i entered law school at the same time in fact there is another justice now that we were all part of the same entering class at

highest bar ratings anybody could get everybody likes them they ought to get their hearing and they ought to be confirmed 1992 andrew hanen was nominated to the federal bench and he finally got his hearing as a federal judge in 2002 10 years later and he was finally confirmed on may 9 2002 so i am so pleased to hear my friends here in the house complaining about highly qualified preeminent legal scholars not getting a hearing because i wasnt even a judge in 1992 but i was running for judge in 1992 in texas and i knew how grossly unfair it was to have the democrats in charge of the senate sit on those nominations and sit and sit now in the case of brilliant baylor lawyer priscilla owen she made the top grade on the state bar exam when it was taken i recall i was sitting across the table from now justice owen and when i got my grade i was thrilled i made a great grade on the bar exam and then people said you were sitting right across the table from priscilla she made the high grade on the bar do you not even cheat at all well the answer is no i dont cheat and i was thrilled with the grade i got but priscilla made the top grade in the entire state on the bar exam she had been a member of the texas supreme court eminently qualified obviously brilliant and she was nominated to be a federal judge by george w bush the first time may 9 of 2001 after her hearing a wait she was nominated may 9 of 2001 and she never got a hearing on that nomination she was nominated again september 4 of 2001 she finally got a hearing july of she was eminently qualified absolutely brilliant according to the texas bar exam she was the smartest lawyer taking the bar exam in texas that month of that year we took the bar it was only given three times a year i think it may just be given twice now it was given three times a year on our bar exam she was the smartest lawyer in the room i would have to tip my hat as well as i did she was a little smarter than i wassmart able lawyer and justice so over a year after she was first nominated july of 2002 she gets a hearing three years later she was never given a vote now i was thrilled to hear from my colleague across the aisle that 67 days is the average wait from the nomination to confirmation since the 1970s so how is it when a brilliant man or women is nominated by george h w bush or george w bush they run into this kind of wall from the democrats even when the republicans had the majority in the senate they didnt have 60 and the democrats were able to hold up and prevent a vote on someone as eminently qualified as priscilla owen so nominated 2001 her 67 days were up and she didnt have a hearing and didnt have a hearing for over a year and then years go by january of 2005 comes and goes and she had gone an entire almost 4 years without the senate democrats giving her a chance to have a votenearly 4 years and they wouldnt give her a vote so february 14 right after george w bush took the oath of office again for a second term 4 years nearly 4 years after her first nomination she was nominated again and she had already had a hearing she finally got a vote in 2005 it took 4 years and getting elected to a second term before they would even give priscilla owen the decency just give her a vote for heavens sake leonard davis it took not only the year of 1992 it took a son of that president that nominated leonard davis to renominate leonard davis before he finally ever got a hearing and a confirmation vote what a lot of people dont understand if you are in a major law firm and you are nominated to the federal bench it wreaks absolute havoc on the life of the nominee because not only do they fill out massive pages of application forms but they also undergo an fbi thorough scrutiny that the senate gets then something that is not reported but i know from having talked to these attorneys who were nominated for the federal bench and then were put on hold for years and years when you are nominated for a federal bench and you are in a major firm you have got tons of clients they are coming to you with their business you are bringing in lots of money for the firm and you are bringing home a great deal of money because you are very successful because with your experience people trust your experience but the minute you get nominated to the federal bench you life goes into chaos because the people at your firm are not going to send you over any cases that they need help on clients are no longer going to come to you because they know you have been nominated for the federal bench and so you are not getting the work anymore your production falls off dramatically who suffers then you do your family does so when someone like andy hanen andrew hanen was nominated to the bench and it took so long to get a hearing it cost him a lot of money it cost his firm a lot of money when priscilla owen sitting on the texas supreme court is nominated to the federal bench and the senate democrats prevent her from getting a vote that she deserves for over 4 yearswhether they are democrats or republicans on the texas supreme court they are smart people generally every now and then a ringer gets on there but most of them are very smart they know if you have been nominated to the federal bench that you could go to the federal bench any day you could go to the federal bench in 67 days according to my democratic colleagues after you are nominated so why would they have you write any major opinions when you could be at appellate level the fifth circuit court of appeals before you will have time to really dig into the appellate case so you go month after month year after year without being allowed to preside and write a majority opinion on a specific case they may get you one here or there that they think wont be a major effort to write but it affects your life it affects your state it affects those you care about so nobody is more thrilled than i am to have heard for nearly an hour my colleagues across the aisle say if somebody is nominated they need to get a hearing and they need to get a vote now that brings us up to current time with president obama having been in office over 7 years now and it has been rather interesting but this administration has set a record my staff cannot find any administration that tops this there have been 11 decisions in a 4year period by the united states supreme court where all nine judges unanimously said the obama administration has vastly overreached what they were doing and they struck down the action unanimously this court four very liberal judges and they 11 times in about 4 years struck down unanimously effort after effort by this administration in fact it is apparently a record that in 4 years this administration was struck down 23 times they werent all unanimous they were before justice scalias death but to have your work as president along with those under you that you were ordering to do as you tell them and to follow your policies and your guidelines to be struck down 23 times in 4 yearsand that is like 2010 or 2011 through 2014 is my understanding so cases since then i am sure will add to the record of the obama administration perhaps now that justice scalia has passed it may enable the obama administration to get through these last months without racking up too many more overrulings by the supreme court but it tells you the mindset of this administration we are going to violate the constitution even the tremendously liberal judges on the supreme court those four come back and say eleven times really you have gone so far beyond what the constitution allows even for us liberals you have gone way too far we have got to reel you in you just cant keep pushing that far so would it be a surprise when an administration makes a nomination in the last months especially since the head of that administration as a senator basically supported the idea that you cant even make a nomination in the last year of your presidency his vice president when he was senator joe bidenthey were all for stopping any nomination the last year of a president so maybe when they were senators they werent always wrong perhaps when they were saying that it was a terrible idea for a president to make a nomination in the last year shouldnt even be given any consideration maybe like a broken clock is right twice a daymaybe that is one of those timeswell they were right on that one i would not submit that that should always be the rule i would not argue that as president obama and vice president biden were pushing they shouldnt give a hearing to george w bushs nominations in the last year i wouldnt push that far but i would submit that when an administration is setting records for being the most unconstitutional administration in history then perhaps in their case it merits slowing down a little bit before you allow them to contribute anymore to unconstitutional actions because those who studied modern history going back to world war ii and preworld war ii we know that president franklin roosevelt didnt like the way the supreme court was ruling so he was threatening to get the number added from 9 to 15 he would appoint 6 and then he could get them to do what he wanted it had the desired effect upon the supreme court they started ruling the things he wanted were not unconstitutional this is also the democratic administration that ordered the interment of people just because of what they looked like and where they were from no republican has ever done that but franklin roosevelt did with this administration 23 times having their actions struck down 11 times unanimous that record perhaps it is an indication that we should hold up our friend andrew mccarthy today with pjmedia com has an article i want to read from part of that article his title is as primary campaigns roll on obama shreds constitutional governance he says two cases in point president obamas pressure on the states to drop sanctions against iran and his continuing scheme to dictate immigration law unilaterally mr mccarthy who was the prosecutor that did a fabulous job in prosecuting the bombers of the first world trade center bombing from back in 1993 says this in his article the invaluable omri ceren citing a bloomberg view report alerts us that the state department has sent monitory letters to the governors of all fifty states suggesting that they review any sanctions imposed against iran over half the states have such sanctions targeting not only irans nuclear work but the regimes other weapons work e g ballistic missiles terror promotion human rights abuses detention of americans etc explains mark dubowitz of the foundation for defense of democracies are an essential part of the nonnuclear sanctions architecture designed to both deter iranian illicit behavior and to safeguard pension funds from the risk associated with entering irans economy alas any counteriranian measure with real teeth is certain to fly in the face of president obamas iran dealthe joint comprehensive plan of action mr mccarthy points out the text of the jcpoa the joint comprehensive plan of action that is the iran treaty it really was a treaty because you cannot amend a treaty the way this one amended prior treaties unless it is a treaty the difference is the senate leadership couldnt work up the courage to bring it to the floor as the treaty it was so that a twothirds vote would not be able to be reached it would not be confirmed and it could have been stopped dead in its tracks if it had been brought to the floor this is such a powerful important issue unlike some that majority leader reid set aside the cloture rule to bring to the floor without a cloture vote this is something that will affect and could bring about the end of millions of lives and that is the largest supporter of terrorism in the world getting their hands on 100 to 150 billion that is just the first year they could get 100 billion a year after that but also getting the green light to go ahead and move forward with the nuclear work that they are doing and the administration may allow them or help them to move along as the clinton administration did for the north koreans you may recall the north koreans struck a deal with wendy sherman who helped out on the iranian deal and president clintoni know this is a shorthand renditionbasically in effect said hey north korea if you will just sign saying you wont use what we give you to develop nuclear weapons we will build you a nuclear power plant we will give you everything you need for nuclear weapons if you will just sign saying you wont develop nuclear weapons of course thinking people knew what would happen and it did happen just as thinking people knew it would you couldnt trust the leader of north korea they took the materials that were provided for power plants they developed nuclear weapons and now this administration has to be constantly concerned about what north korea is doing because they have nuclear weapons they wanted to help iran all because of the deal that wendy sherman helped do back during the clinton administration and now she helped make happen with iran so they were able to keep working as they thought then we found out more recently in just recent weeks that actually the department of justice and this presidents administrationsurely had to include the white houseknew that iranians had hacked into our system here they were charged with hacking into the system but according to recent reports the justice department was talked into holding up on the charges until after the iranian deal could be madeit wasnt confirmed it is not a legitimate treatybut at least squeak through without the twothirds of the senate being opposed which is not the treatment treaties are supposed to get according to the constitution but that doesnt keep some folks from acting unconstitutionally so anyway it turns out the obama administration encouraged the justice department to sit on those charges they knew iran had people hacking into our system it had to be government sanctioned you dont do that in iran without government permission this administration knew about ballistic missile testing that violated all kinds of things yet this administration we knew and some of us said right here on this floor that there will be violations and this administration will have to turn their head and act like they dont really see the violations because they twisted so many arms and did so many deals to try to get the iran treaty treated as if it is a treaty without the confirmation that they could not afford for people to know how blatantly iran leaders were violating their agreements this article from mr mccarthy goes on the text of the jcpoa expressly indulges irans position that it will cease performing commitments under the deal if it deems the sanctions to have been reinstated in whole of part that threat should only relate to sanctions on irans nuclear program butas the obama administration well knewmany of the sanctions against significant iranian entities e g the national iranian oil company and bank melli are based on activities in addition to support for the nuclear program moreover iran has publicly announced that it interprets the jcpoa the iran treaty we will call it as a sweeping eradication of sanctions related both to various nonnuclear activities e g other weapons and ballistic missiles and to sectors of its economy sanctioned due to activities beyond support for the nuclear program against that backdrop the jcpoa also purports to oblige the federal government to use all available authorities law at the state or local level is preventing the implementation of sanctions lifting as specified in this jcpoa that is amazing the administration makes a deal that they are willing to sign a deal with iran that violates our own constitution they have no right to dictate laws to state and local authorities but they apparently signed a deal with iran that they would dictate state and local law this is a foreign relations matter so why does the iran deal commit washington merely to encourage and otherwise try to persuade state and local officials to honor the deals terms because for all its bluster about domestic and international law the administration knows this deal has no legal standing plainly the president is trying to muscle his way through the inconvenience that the jcpoa is merely an executive agreement it is not a legally enforceable treaty nor is it supported by any legislation that would bind the states obama is willing it to work through sheer extralegal executive power the article goes on it is a good article but then again when we look at the recordsetting slaps at this administrations overreach in violation of the constitution 11 unanimous decisions in 4 years or so and 23 reversals by the supreme court in such a short period of timea or 5 yearsthese are recordshave that many reversals in such a short time that it bears great scrutiny when an administration setting records for violating the constitution says right before we go out we want to get this person onto the supreme court because we have some other stuff that is still going to be ruled on by the supreme court after we are gone and we want some of that stuff that may be unconstitutional like the 23 times the supreme court said they were struck down thingsthey want those upheld in the future it seems like these are good reasons for the senate to be very careful much more so than they were about the iran treaty there is an article from paul bedard obamas opendoor immigration policy blamed for surge in rural gang crime 1730 a rural maryland sheriff on tuesday blamed and this is maryland this isnt texas it is not arizona a rural maryland sheriff on tuesday blamed president obamas opendoor immigration policy for a surge in gangland crime that included a retaliation murder and assault on an officer doing paperwork in his cruiser casebycase amnesty backdoor amnesty daca programs and the dream act were pushed through by executive order said frederick county sheriff charles jenkins policy shifts by president obama weakened and ruined secure communities and did not allow action by ice when sheriffs and police departments ignored detainers allowing criminals to be released back on the streets in effect criminal aliens that should have been deported have been allowed to remain and commit more serious crimes becoming violent offenders he told the house judiciary committee probing the criminal impact of illegals in the united states he was joined by family members of victims of illegal immigrant crime a surging issue around the nation as obamas policies allow more unauthorized aliens to leave jail and remain in the country frederick is north of washington d c but has become a haven for criminal transnational gangs especially in high schools members of ms13 and 18th street gangs have become influential in the schools and county transnational alien gangs are structured criminal enterprises involved in drug and human trafficking crimes of violence over turf retaliation money laundering and other serious crime as these gangs are recruiting locally and increasing in number so does the associated crime within communities said jenkins he gave details on the crimes by immigrant gangs in his county there are over 75 active known validated transnational criminal gang members in frederick county many more suspected of gang affiliation we also believe that ms13 and 18th street alien gangs are recruiting locally in our schools in the region and out of the country of the 52 validated criminal alien gang members identified since 2008 25 of the 52 48 percent were identified since late 2014 eighteen of the 25 72 percent gang members encountered since 2014 have been charged with felonies seven of 11 64 percent of the criminal alien gang members encountered in 2015 were unaccompanied juveniles when they entered the unitedstates and eventually located to frederick county maryland now they are adults committing serious felonies crimes committed include five occurrences of attempted first and second degree murder armed robbery first degree assault home invasion armed carjacking kidnapping use of a firearm in the commission of a violent felony carrying concealed deadly weapons in 2014 eight criminal aliens charged with rape and sexual assault of children ages 5 to 14 with two of the girls impregnated one of my deputies was the victim of an unprovoked physical attack assault with an ms13 gang member while sitting in his cruiser doing paperwork the unitedstates district court recently indicted a known alien gang member for involvement in a 2013 ms13 hired killing in frederick the victim in the killing fled el salvador to live in frederick because of an ms13 hit for him there but the hit order carried to a local ms13 clique the victim was lured to a wooded area where he was shot in the head and stabbed to death the growing alien gang problem has spread into one high school where fights and violence between ms13 and 18th street are routine that goes back to this important point about this administrations urging and luring people into the united states illegally by talking about the amnesty talking about legal status and as has been made clear by border patrol when anyone in washington whatever party either house or senate talk about legal status or amnesty it creates a surge across our southern border having been there in the last few weeks spending nights and days down there on the border on the river aside the riverand i do mean all hours of the day and nightyou see these things firsthand you see little bitty children the border patrol are told they came unaccompanied there is no way these little children came unaccompanied across a river flowing that fast and that deep some of them alleged to have come from central america over a thousand miles they journeyed unaccompanied that is garbage it is like border patrolmen have told meone in particular he said i am hispanic i speak better spanish than most of them ninety percent of the time when they tell me they came to escape gang violence i will hit them up you may convince some gringo of that but you and i both know you paid a gang to bring you in to the united states and he said90 percent of the time the response iswell that is true but we were told to say we were fleeing gang violence as other border patrolmen have told me down there there is not one inch of our southern border that isnt considered the jurisdiction of some drug cartel some drug lord and if you cross within that sector without getting permission or properly paying making sure the drug lord or the drug cartel is satisfied with your payment then you will be sought and found and either killed or be forced to provide services until your debt is paid that is why it is staggering when people down on the border having come across illegally are asked about how much they paid it is not part of the required questions but some of our border patrol are really wanting to know what is the going rate here for this sector for people like you from the country you came from what are they charging you and you get different answers 5 000 6 000 7 000 8 000 maybe 10 000 for a group the response comes back how in the world could you have come up with that much money the resulting answer is well they said i could work it off when i get to the unitedstates city where i am going you know they have agreed to work for a drug cartel for a gang for ms13 for 18th street and it is not just along the texas border as we have seen from frederick maryland it is all over the country people have agreed to provide the services as i have pointed out here before border patrol says the drug cartels the gangs in mexico call us their logistics because they know under this administration if they just get somebody across the border across the rio grande get them across illegally then we become their logistics and we ship them wherever they want to go they tell us we have got an address or i have got a family member here a family member there or somebody that i have agreed to take care of me they dont say it but it sounds like it could also mean the drug cartel gave me this address and they told me this is where i am supposed to go they dont say this is where the drug cartel told me to go what does anyone expect when they have said the drug cartel is going to let me work it off is it any wonder that so many of the crimes in america are being committed by people who have come into the country illegally we know that most people coming in illegally are not violent criminals i got that we have that we understand that but when people come into the country illegallyand by the way for those that have not noticed they are not in the shadows i know there were a few in the shadows under the trees because it got hot out there in front of the supreme court but most were out in front of the supreme court they are not in the shadows people keep saying we have got to bring them out of the shadows well start looking they are not in the shadows in fact we had a group come to some offices here in the capitol they are not in the shadows they are coming right in the office and demanding that we legalize those of them who have come in illegally the problem isand this is the biggest problemwhen the brightest hope in the world as a nation which once was the freest nation in the world once was the freest nation in the history of the world now international polls say we are not but we have been the freest nation but when the freest nation stops trying to apply the law equally across the board then we become like the countries these poor unfortunate individuals fled because their country did not apply the rule of law equally it depended on who you were how much you could pay or what you could do for them we become like the countries they had to flee and there is nowhere left for people holding out hope for one place in the world where they can come and be free it is gone i have had people even in congress say louie if it gets too bad we will just pack up and go to australia when i told that to some australians in january none of them smiled they said if something happens to united states freedom china will take us over instantly you wont have us to come to if something happens to the united states and we continue to damage ourselves the way europe has damaged itself there isnt going to be any place else left to go that is what the west africans told me 3 or 4 years ago they said you have got to tell people in washingtonyou know as thrilled as we were when you elected your first black president we have seen you getting weaker and weaker youre not standing up like you used to we are christians we are going to heaven when we die but our only hope of a life of peace in this world is if america is strong when we weaken the rule of law when we have a president make millions and millions of exceptions to the law we are on our way to becoming like the countries people that came here illegally had to leave for those who say we need to follow the bible i certainly believe that and for individuals there is no better place to start than within the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you but when you are acting as part of the government and you refuse to do what the bible says and that is show no partiality to those because they are rich show no partiality because someone is poor or unfortunate you apply justice across the board that is the ultimate good government you provide justice you see that the rule of law is equally enforced across the board again as this administration is trying to stack the supreme court while on its way out after setting a record for being found to be the most unconstitutional in the shortest time this article from today is entitled obama administration unsure if iran spent 3 billion in new cash on terrorism it is an article about the obama administration with the complicity of secretary of state kerry making sure iran gets 100 billion to 150 billion the article reads obama administration officials disclosed tuesday that iran has been granted access to about 3 billion in unfrozen assets in the months since the nuclear agreement was implemented but it remains unclear to the administration if the islamic republic has spent any of this money to fund its global terrorism enterprise we know in having listened to the iranian leaderswhile this administration was saying oh yes we have got to abide by this iranian dealthe iranian leaders were assuring their people we are not abiding by anything that the united states tells us to do we are still doing everything we intend to do we are not going to be restrained by any agreement with the united states they announced in iran we are going to be able to provide more financial support once we get the 100 billion to 150 billion more support for terrorist groupshamas and hezbollah they told us now the administration this week is saying gee we cant be sure they didnt use some or all of this moneywho knows on terrorism they quote state department spokesman john kirby as saying we dont know we dont have a way when an administration like the leaders of iran lie and lie and are responsible for providing more terrorism and more death and destruction in the world than any other countrythe largest supporter of terrorism in the worldand when they tell you they are going to take money you give them and spend it on terrorism that may be the one thing you can count on their being honest about in going back to november 2015 to the story by john hayward it talks about the state departments social media accounts that were hacked by iran the surge has led american officials to a stark conclusion for iran cyberespionagewith the power it gives the iranians to jab at the united states and its neighbors without provoking a military responseis becoming a tool to seek the kind of influence that some hardliners in iran may have hoped its nuclear program would eventually provide the new york times reports we have this report from december of 20154 short months ago iranian hackers infiltrated a small new york dam in 2013 in a previously undisclosed incident according to the wall street journal this is an article by katie bo williams from the hill and this was december 21 investigators said that the hackers didnt take control of the system but were probing its defenses the white house knew about it they knew about the intrusion into new yorks system so people are wondering how could people support donald trump new york got hacked by iran and this administration has done nothing about it but try to defend iran from having the money cut that they have said they will use for terrorism so is it any wonder new yorkers are thinking well here is a guy who says he is going to completely stop this kind of activity with radical islamic groups sure of course people will vote for a person who will say that here is an article from january 25 2015 five ways iran is cheating on the interim nuclear deal that was the interim deal it goes on and sets out how they have been cheating here is an article from december 16 2015 irans october missile test violated u n ban that was the conclusion of an expert panel according to this reuters com story by louis charbonneau it reads iran violated a u n security council resolution in october by testfiring a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead yet this administration did not see that as any reason to slow down rushing the 100 billion to 150 billion that they had coming to iran this article from katie pavlich reads white house likely iran violated u n sanctions with missile test but theyll uphold nuclear agreement she quotes from white house press secretary josh earnest despite the likely violation earnest stressed that the white house believes the iranian regime will uphold its obligations to the recently made nuclear agreement amazing because it turned out they already knew that iran had been hacking our government web sites and our government internet they had charges held up so that it wouldnt stop what we now know is an executive agreement acting like a treaty they are still doing it some of us said they would have to they have bent over so far backwards to get an agreement with the largest state supporter of terrorism in the world that once iran continued to violate even to the point of taking our sailors prisoner violating the geneva convention rules on prisonershumiliating the prisonersnot only did this administration not send more navy forces to take back the navy sailors who were imprisoned but it gushed about how wonderful iran was to take charge of our sailors as the videos emergedmocking america as they treated our navy sailors as just trash then we get this story by bradley klapper unitedstates considers easing ban on dollars to help iran this administration wants to turn around and give iranthe largest state supporter of terrorismaccess to our dollars apparently that would mean access to internet sites to bank sites when they know they have been hacking us they are trying to figure out ways to bring down the united states and now this administration wants to help them to show how good of friends we can be that is like trying to convince a bully on the playground that you will keep giving him money because you are his dear friend he will keep taking your money but he will never see you as a friend not only does he not see you as a friend but the more you give him the more contempt he has for you as a coward this article today from caroline may reads mother of daughter killed by illegal his bail was less than it cost to bury my baby the mother of a recent college graduate who was killed by an illegal immigrant who later absconded after posting bail and remains at large offered emotional testimony tuesday before a house panel michelle root the mother of 21yearold sarah root spoke about the devastation of losing her daughter at the hands of eswin mejia an illegal immigrant who killed root while street racing drunk this is different from the story we talked about yesterday mejia was able to flee when immigration and customs enforcement declined to detain him and he was able to post bail eswin spent 4 days in jail and is believed to have fled the country michelle root said he posted 5 000 bond which was less than the cost it was to bury my daughter sarah because of the lack of controls the police immigration unitedstates marshals and law enforcement have little or no information on his whereabouts eswin was not a stranger to law enforcement and failed to honor his legal obligations for minor traffic infractions prior to killing my daughter now a failed local judicial system that set his bail too low coupled with flawed obama administration policies have rewarded the illegal and punished my family and hampered law enforcement in their investigations there are plenty of good reasons to wait for a different nominee for the supreme court we wont even make them wait 10 years like the democrats in the senate made my friends we wont make them wait 4 or 5 years as senate democrats did my friends before they would give them a confirmation in setting records for unconstitutionality in such a short time it bears our being diligent when the administration is not peoples lives are at stake they have already been lost more are at stake we have got to stand up i yield back the balance of my time"], [2.6226043701171875e-06, 0.9999973773956299, 1, "i want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman marcia fudge for her leadership of the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to

joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the epa and army corps of engineers rule relating to the definition of waters of the united states under the clean water act the rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 under a structured rule making four amendments in order three from the democrats and one from the republicans h r 3662 under a closed rule and s j res 22 also under a closed rule like many americans i have grave concerns about the administrations nuclear agreement with iran since the agreements adoption in july iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the west in many ways the iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the united states and our allies against u n security council resolutions the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program testing two missiles as recently as last fall just on december 26 an iranian military ship fired a rocket near unitedstates and french military vessels in the persian gulf these incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted further iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism a direct threat to our closest ally in the region israel continues rampant human rights abuses and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five american citizens president obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions which could return as much as 100 billion in frozen assets to tehran will help iran down a more moderate path however reality appears to show the contrary is occurring just weeks after the deal was signed supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei stated that we wont allow american political economic or cultural influence in iran and just last week the supreme leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that americans have set their eyes covetously on elections but the great and vigilant nation of iran will act contrary to the enemies will whether it be in elections or on other issues and as before will punch them in the mouth while president obama may find something positive in irans actions and statements i believe congress owes it to the american people to view iran with skepticism and concern h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act requires the president to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the iranian nuclear deal are not involved in irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or its ballistic missile program by passing this legislation congress can help ensure that the unitedstates will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of iran in arguing for the nuclear deals adoption the president committed to congress and to the american people that our sanctions on iran for its support of terrorism its human rights abuses its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced this legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the president to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced additionally this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect american businesses and families from the administrations regulatory overreach this rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 legislation that was drafted in response to the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcements ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams it is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule in december 2008 the outgoing bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule this rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation extensive scientific research environmental analyses public comment and a concurrence from the environmental protection agency put simply this rule was developed the right way with transparency unbiased research scientific integrity stakeholder engagement and most importantly public involvement however shortly after the final 2008 rule was released several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the osm ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between osm and the environmental groups after numerous missed deadlines the environmental organizations renewed the litigation the administration agreed with the complaint as a result the court vacated the 2008 rule and osm subsequently restarted the rulemaking process since that time the entire process has lacked transparency oversight conducted by the house committee on natural resources of which i am a member revealed that the settlement agreements expedited timeframe coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process resulted in major issues with the administrations rule now this may sound just a little familiar it is the very same sue and settle practice that the house addressed just last week with the passage of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act the outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people businesses and jobs they are supposed to be supporting backroom deals between environmental groups and federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few namely special interests and environmental groups for 6 years osm has been rewriting this rule and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over 10 million though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking american families the stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal which accounts for nearly half of our countrys electricity leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses according to a study from the national mining association the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40 000 and 77 000 and the total job losses is between 112 000 and 280 000 a fact that is underscored by the nations second largest oil company arch coal filing for bankruptcy largely due to the increased cost of federal regulations that happened just this week for these reasons it is imperative that we pass h r 1644 legislation that delays the rules implementation increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule and reduces duplicative regulation this rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that i hear about very often in my congressional district it strikes the controversial waters of the united states or wotus rule s j res 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the presidents wotus rule that was passed by the senate in bipartisan fashion and it is now time for the house to consider and pass this important measure this legislation was crafted in response to the wotus rule promulgated by the epa and the army corps of engineers which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act by issuing this rule these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the united states like many of my constituents i am very concerned with this massive federal overreach it goes far beyond the agencies statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on american farmers and small businesses but on states and local governments the rule is another federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water s j res 22 utilizes the congressional review act to block this harmful regulation and it is time to send this critical measure to the presidents desk i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country we must pass h r 1644 and s j res 22 to protect american families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the obama administration furthermore the united states must stand with our allies in the middle east as well as around the world in the face of growing iranian aggression which threatens not only the stability of the region but the strength of unitedstates alliances and standing in the world i stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the obama administrations shortsighted nuclear agreement does not unravel decades of work by the unitedstates and our allies to impose meaningful sanctions on the country of iran these sanctions have restricted irans ability to spread its radical beliefs and inflict unknown damage on its neighbors in the region and i urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"],

with what i call a sunset memorial because you see before the sun sets today in america almost 4 000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave that is more than the number of innocent lives lost on september 11 in this country by a multitude of thousands and it happens every day it has now been 42 years since the tragedy called roe v wade was first handed down since then the very foundation of this nation has been stained by the blood of almost 56 million of its own unborn children some of them cried and screamed as they died but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we couldnt hear them all of them had at least four things in common first they were just little babies who had never done anything wrong to anyone each one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each one of their mothers whether she realizes it or not will never quite be the same all the gifts that these children might have brought for humanity and to humanity are now lost forever yet even in the glare of such tragedy this generation still clings to this blind invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victimsthose yet unborn we should remember the quotes of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember americas founding fathers when he said their enlightened belief was that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posterityand that is us mr speaker when in the distant future some man some factions some interests should set up a doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity again that is usmight look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began when authorities entered the clinic of dr kermit gosnell they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language according to the grand jury report dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them now he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise and the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise she said it sounded like a little alien for gods sake is this who we really are kermit gosnell now rightfully sits in prison for killing a mother and murdering innocent paincapable children like the one i just described yet if he had killed them only 5 minutes earlier and before they had passed through the birth canal it would have all been perfectly legal in many of the united states of america including here in the district of columbia if there is one thing we must not miss about this unspeakably evil episode it is that kermit gosnell is not an anomaly he is just the visible face of this lucrative enterprise of murdering paincapable unborn children in america more than 18 000 very lateterm abortions are occurring in america every year placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and subjecting their paincapable unborn babies to torture and death without anesthesia it is the worst atrocity in america today and this in the land of the free and the home of the brave throughout history there has often been great intensity surrounding the debates of protecting the innocent lives of those who through no fault of their own find themselves obscured in the shadows of humanity it encourages me greatly that in nearly all of those cases the collective conscience was finally moved in favor of the victims the same thing is beginning to happen in this debate related to innocent unborn children especially those that are pain capable we are beginning to ask ourselves the real question does abortion take the life of a child we are especially asking the question recently does very lateterm abortion torture and take the life of a paincapable baby and we are finally beginning to realize as human beings that it does ultrasound technology now demonstrates to all reasonable observers both the humanity of the victim and the inhumanity of what is being done to them and we are beginning to realize as americans that taking brutally the lives of the innocent unborn does not liberate anyone and that 56 million children is enough ironically i have heard barack obama speak such poignant words that whether he knows it or not apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in america let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged he went on to say and by that measure can we truly say as a nation that we are meeting our obligations can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our childrenall of them safe from harm can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives with happiness and purpose the president went on to say i have been reflecting on this the last few days and if we are honest with ourselves the answer is no we are not doing enough and we will have to change oh how true the presidents words are the president also said we cant tolerate this anymore these tragedies must end and to end them we must change and then the president asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom is this not the most relevant of questions we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn babies in america every day the president has said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm finally he said that is our generations taskto make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted and yet this president in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself refuses to apply these majestic words to helpless unborn babies oh how i wish somehow that mr obama and all of us could open our hearts and our ears to his words and ask ourselves in the core of our own soul why his words that should apply to all children cannot apply to the most helpless of all children we honor abraham lincoln most because he found the courage as president of the united states in the days of slavery and he found the humanity within himself to recognize the image of god stamped on the soul of slaves that the supreme court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didnt recognize as protectable under the law could it still be that president barack obama might consider that perspective as well as his own legacy and even eternity itself and recognize that those little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help could it be that the president might finally remember that on the pages of the bible on which he laid his hands were the words written in red inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me whether he does or not it is time for those of us in this chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here thomas jefferson said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without the due process of law the 14th amendment tells us that we should have equal protection of the laws for all protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here the bedrock foundation of this republic is that clarion declaration of the selfevident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable rights the rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness every conflict and battle our nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core selfevident truth it has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world it is truly who we are yet today another day has passed as so many sunset memorials that i have given another day has passed and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment we have failed our sworn oath and our godgiven responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4 000 more innocent unborn babies who died today without the protection we should have given them so let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that it is time we stood up together again and looked up to the declaration of independence and that we remember that we are the same america that rejected human slavery and marched into europe to arrest the nazi holocaust and we are still the courageous and compassionate nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn children than abortion on demand it is still not too late for us to make a better world and for america to be the one that leads the rest of the planet just as we did in the days of slavery from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4 000 of our own children every day so now as we consider the thousands the hundreds of thousands out on the mall marching to protect these little babies as we consider the plight of the unborn for 42 years under roe v wade maybe we can each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered and that we too each one shall walk from these chambers one day for the very last time if it should be that congress is allowed to convene on yet another day may that be the day when we finally hear the cries when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children may that be the day when we find the humanity and the constitutional duty to protect these the least of our tiny little american brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our nation called abortion on demand it is now 42 years to the day since roe v wade first stained the foundation of this nation

the gentlewoman from new jersey focusing on the congressional progressive caucus commitment to ensuring every american can vote might i add that we have worked together with the congressional hispanic caucus we have worked together with the congressional black caucus and we have worked together with the democratic caucus i rise today to encourage the entire house to be committed to the very values of this nation this should not be a republican or democratic issue of which it has become we stand here as democrats arguing for the empowerment of voters all over the nation yet legislative initiatives have been introduced by members of the judiciary committee and others i have joined a number of those legislative initiatives and these initiatives cannot be heard and cannot be voted on the american people need to know that there is no other reason than the republican majority does not want to have empowered voters this is unlike what we did in years past i have had the privilege of being on the house judiciary committee for a number of years and the most powerful and moving experience wasand there have been many experiences on the house judiciary committeewhen all of us came together to help write the restoration or reauthorization of the 1965 voting rights act 1815 it was a very emotional and tearful moment it was a moment of great extensiveness15 000 pages of testimony many many many witnesses individuals explaining how precious it is to vote but more importantly how not having protection for the vote can therefore disallow them to vote i guess the most provocative experience was a republican president being joined by republican and democratic members on a joyful sunny day signing the legislation that reauthorized the voting rights act of 1965 mind you that bill exhibits if you will the pain and suffering of so many who marched and marched and marched and marched not only did they march they died like jimmie lee jackson or our own colleague from georgia john lewis who reminds us every day of the fear and feeling of being beaten near to death in his march across the edmund pettus bridge in selma alabama he also reminds us how precious the right to vote is when dr martin luther king who refused to give up or give out or give in marched again and they made itwith so many people from all backgrounds and all over the nationto montgomery alabama on that fateful trip back everyone was celebrating that they had marched for the voting rights act that they had gotten through without violenceattributable of course to a texas president by the name of lyndon baines johnson when a wonderful wonderful ladywhose children i had the privilege of meetingwas driving back some foot soldiers whom we will honor shortly at the leadership of terri sewell when they were driving back and viola liuzzo was behind the wheel lo and behold somebody violently took a gun and killed her voting has never been easy voting rights has never been easy a lot of blood was shed it baffles me why we are faced with a situation where the united states supreme court eliminated section 5not an illegal provision but a provision that somebody disliked because i believe it empowered voters what the congress was tasked to do by the court which i think incorrectly and wrongly ignored 15 000 pages of testimony ignored tens upon tens of witnesses in a meticulous rewriting of the voting rights act to prove that it was still necessary in a skewed deliberation the supreme court decided to reject it indicating that it was long passe and of course some brilliant legislators used the example because we have eliminated polio because of the vaccination is it appropriate to get rid of the vaccination no it is not so with that skewed and if i might use the term weird reasoning we are left holding the bag and the door is open to the kinds of laws such as voter id laws that spread across america like a contagious disease because we did not have the protection of section 5 which the idea of section 5 was a preclearance for men and women of goodwill to look and determine whether or not a procedure was going to block individuals from voting of course the voter id law from texas sprung up you will soon hear from the gentleman from texas my dear friend and colleague because he was in fact the leader on the lawsuit let me say that that terrible law blocked a lot of people from voting i want to remind people that the day of august 6 1965 in the presence of such luminaries as the reverend dr martin luther king roy wilkins of the naacp whitney young of the national urban league james forman of the congress of racial equality a philip randolph john lewis robert kennedy hubert humphrey and everett dirksenmind you a lady was missing but in the event many women were foot soldiers the point was made on the voting rights act the vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men in this instance i would modify it and say women when the voting id lawbecause of the misgivings of the state of texas and its legislaturewas put in place there were 80 counties at least in texas that did not have a department of public safety office for individuals to be able to register or to be able to get an id that is a tragedy each moment there is something coming out of texas that wants to in essence put down the rights of individuals to vote one case that should be brought to our attention is a case before the supreme court that indicates a group of petitioners who dont like the fact that you represent a population of people so they want to characterize and get a definition of what a person means and they want to make that person be an eligible voter so in essence a sick person laying in a bed who needs health care and needs to be represented is not an eligible voter or a senior citizen that has gotten so old and feeble that they may not have been registered because of their illness and their feebleness but they need to be represented or it may be a childhispanic african american anglo or asianwho is not at the age of voting and they are not an eligible voter or as i know they are focusing on is hardworking individuals who happen to be immigrants and they are not yet eligible to vote and this case is brought primarily to make sure that those people who need to be represented to the extent that they are taxpayers but are not yet status they will not be counted this case is not anything to do with voter fraud these people are not trying to vote they are just trying to survive but you are telling me that they are human beings and this case is suggesting that they cannot be represented this is the devastating impact of not having voter protection in section 5 so i rise today to ensure that it is heard throughout the land we can pass voter restoration voter advancement we can pass fixing the voting rights act and restoring section 5 there are many people in this congress who previously were here when we stood with president bush a republican and republicans and democrats 981 982 in the senate massive support in the house to restore the voting rights act let me ask the question mr speaker why now why are we struggling in this presidential year not to allow people to vote let me close my remarks because we could go on withhow should i say itthe irony and as well the wrongness of not passing legislation but let me say this in closing redistricting is a result of the voting rights act those of us in texas are still in litigationfor 20 years some of uson the question of redistricting and making fair districts where all people are represented and the gerrymandering that has been done that disallows and disenfranchises whole chunks of minorities disallowing them from voting for the person of their choice do you know what it brings about it brings about this house in the majoritygood friends of minehaving the sheer gall to deny the presidents representative of the office of management and budget to present the presidents budget in its 41year history that has never happened but because we have these districts that are drawn not representing the vast numbers of people who should be able to hear the presidents statement about his budget by having his

wanted to do this in regular order but the facts are that if we allow these amendments that are just aimed at killing the exportimport bank to pass and thousands of people are going to lose their jobs

only just beginning it is only just beginning with this rule today with the passage of this rule today we are beginning the 2016 appropriations process and we are doing it in ways that we have not done before since i received a voting card in this body number one we are beginning at the earliest date in 40 years not since 1973 has this chamber gotten about the peoples business as early as we are this year the people deserve it the people have earned it and we are delivering on it today i am proud of that fact number two we are in fact on the brink of the first balanced budget conference report this body has seen since 2003 it is too long coming we have had to deem appropriations levels year after year after year not on just two bills as we are today but on the entire package that report could be filed as early as this afternoon and there is no question but that it is going to pass both of these bodies it is good work from this institution and the senate across the hill but as you could hear in the passion in my friend from floridas voice not everyone is going to be happy with every line in these two bills i dont have to just look to the democratic side of the aisle i can look to the republican side of the aisle not everyone is going to be happy with every line of this bill but do you know what any member can come and change any line the rules committee protected no language in this bill any member can come and change any line any member can come and make these bills better any member can come and have their districts voice heard all you have to do is find 217 of your friends to agree with you we will pass it and we will send it to the united states senate for consideration that is the way it ought to be these are going to be some long nights we are going to have these are going to be some lengthy amendment debates we are going to have these are going to be some votearamas we are going to have but america is going to be the better for it because the laws of the land that we pass are going to be better for it i have the statement of administration policy here i have one for each one of the bills that this rule makes in order the president has said in these statements of administration policy that his senior advisers are going to recommend that he veto these bills why it is because these bills and other legislation implement the current republican budget framework which blocks the needed investments for our economy to compete in the future it is not the republican budget framework it is called the law of the land as signed by president barack obama we can pretend the law doesnt exist or we can confront the law as it exists that is what these bills do a 6 percent increase in veterans funding and a 3 percent increase in our energy and water investment in a time of austere budgets we are plussing up those accounts that are so important to our constituents back home i urge strong support for this rule i urge strong support for the underlying bills and i urge strong support for beginning the process where every single member will be able to have his or her voice heard it is the way this institution ought to be and it is the way this institution will be if we pass this rule today i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution the previous question was ordered"], [0.0680130124092102,
