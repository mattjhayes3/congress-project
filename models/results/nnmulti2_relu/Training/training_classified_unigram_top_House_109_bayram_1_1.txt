and hear what it is that we are sharing with this country there may be many many people out there that say i did not know that although we talk about many firsts accomplishments from members of our communities i am sure also that those who are first expect never to be last that they would continue that we would continue to contribute to this country and in order to contribute to our country we have to also defend the constitution defending the constitution and defending the rights of our people also entails the voting rights this past week h r 9 the voting rights act reauthorization was introduced the right to vote is keenly felt by the asian and pacific islander american community chinese americans could not vote until the chinese exclusion acts of 1882 and 1892 were repealed in 1943 firstgeneration japanese americans could not vote until 1952 because of the racial restrictions contained in the 1790 naturalization law with the markup in judiciary committee tomorrow we need to ensure that important provisions such as section 203 which has been very vital to the api communitys ability to participate in the electoral process gets reauthorized in this congress languageminority citizens were often denied needed assistance at the polls in the 1975 amendments to the voting rights act such assigtance became required in certain situations and we need to ensure that these provisions continue to remain in current law as americans we need to ensure that our children receive a quality education but also provide adequate teacher training funds for afterschool and extracurricular activities and ensuring that college is affordable for every student that deserves to receive a higher education according to the unitedstates census 50 percent of asians age 25 and over have a bachelors degree or higher level of education however i would like to emphasize that when we disaggregate the data when we tease apart the information for the api subgroups we find that the model minority stereotype is in fact a myth only 9 1 percent of cambodian americans 7 4 percent hmong americans 7 6 lao americans 19 5 percent vietnamese americans and 16 percent of native hawaiians and pacific islanders who are 25 years and older have a bachelors degree these numbers show that we must do a better job of disaggregating data and information about our communities to assess the needs of those hardworking americans who still falter behind to address the disparities between subgroups of the larger apia community we need congress to pass the asian american and pacific islander serving institutions bill which my colleague from oregon congressman david wu will be introducing later this month this legislation will provide federal grants to colleges and universities that have an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent apia and at least 50 percent of its degreeseeking students receive financial assistance as a caucus we will work to increase the availability of loan assistance scholarships and programs to allow apia students to attend a higher education institution to ensure full funding for teachers and bilingual education programs under the no child left behind law to support english language learners and to support full funding of minority outreach programs for access to higher education such as the trio programs to expand services to serve apia students a common misperception of apias is that as a group we face fewer health problems than other racial and ethnic groups in fact apias as a group and specific populations within this group do experience disparities in health and health care for example apias have the highest hepatitis b rates of any racial group in the united states apias are also five times more likely to develop cervical and liver cancer than any other ethnic and racial group according to the census bureau 18 percent of apias went without insurance for the entire year in 2000 this means that the uninsured are not only more likely to go without care for serious medical conditions they are also more likely to go without routine care less likely to have a regular source of care less likely to use preventive services and have fewer visits per year at the same time without appropriate language translation services or properly translated materials limitedenglishproficient immigrants cannot receive adequate care as well as state and federal benefits for which they may be eligible in the apia community 76 percent of hmong americans 61 percent of vietnamese americans 52 percent of korean americans and 39 percent of tongans speak limited english therefore eliminating health care disparities in the apia community must include data collection linguistically appropriate and culturally competent services and access to health insurance capac has been working with both the congressional hispanic and black caucuses on the health care equality and accountability act to eliminate ethnic and racial health disparities for all of our communities i have introduced the health care equality and accountability act which will address expanding the health care safety net by diversifying the health care workforce combating diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities emphasizing prevention and behavioral health and promoting the collection and dissemination of data and enhanced medical research i would also like to extend my gratitude to the patriotic men and women serving our country in the military including the 60 813 apias serving on active duty in the unitedstates armed services as well as the 28 066 in the reserves and the national guard i also commend and thank the 351 000 apia veterans who fought for this country i would like to highlight and honor the filipino veterans as my colleague had done who have not been compensated and recognized for their service which i believe is a national disservice to these brave veterans as a country it is our duty to ensure that these veterans have equal access to all the benefits and treatment that other veterans receive we believe that our troops should be taken care of when we send them into battle and that they should be given the respect when they return home therefore i stand with my colleagues congressman issa and congressman filner to support their bipartisan legislation h r 4574 to restore full benefits to these veterans who fought for our nation during world war h with congressman issa taking the lead and congressman filner in a leadership position in the veterans affairs committee we have a great chance to get this bill to the floor in honor of the centennial celebration of filipinos in hawaii and to keep the word of congress that we gave to these brave veterans of world war ii i am proud of our communitys accomplishment and i would like to recognize many of the apia firsts in areas of art film sports sciences academia and politics in each effort these folks who were first expect that they are not the last in 1847 yung wing the first chinese american graduated from yale university and the first apia to graduate from a unitedstates college in 1863 william ah hang who was chinese american became the first apia to enlist in the u s navy during the civil war in 1944 an wang a chinese american who invented the magnetic core memory revolutionized computing and served as a standard method for memory retrieval and storage in 1946 wing f ong a chinese american from arizona became the first apia to be elected to state office in 1948 victoria manalo draves a filipino american diver became the first woman to win olympic gold medals in both the 10 meter platform and the 3 meter spring board events in 1956 dalip singh saud the first indian american to be elected to congress in 1965 patsy takemoto mink the first japanese woman and woman of color elected to congress who championed title ix in 1985 haing ngor a cambodian american became the first apia to win an academy award for his role in the movie killing fields in 1985 ellison onizuka a japanese american became the first apia astronaut whose life was lost in a launching tragedy in conclusion the asian american pacific islander american community continues to fight for our civil liberties and our civil rights as americans even after the internment of the japanese americans during world war ii we as a community did not grow embittered or cowed by discrimination instead we progressed and moved forward i am proud to be a member of the apia community because we continue to serve as positive contributors to our many communities by investing in education business and cultural opportunities for all americans in closing this asian pacific american heritage month we take pride in our history accomplishments and the promise of our future as we continue to pave the way for a better tomorrow in the name of dreams and challenges of asian pacific americans the 6 years i have served here i learned that asian americans have a unique contribution to make to this body and to this country and that we because of our history in this country uniquely understand and recognize that our constitution is never tested in times of tranquility our constitution is always tested in times of trauma terror tension and tragedy and to the point where we can internalize the principles of our bill of rights and our constitution and to the point where we understand that defending this constituion and its people will we be able to face as members of this body face overwhelming public approval which could be wrong and stand up to them say it is wrong because it does not follow the constitution these are the kinds of heritage and contributions asian americans have made will make and continue to make in this country so that we may fulfill the phrase in the preamble of our constitution that says to form a more perfect union in the words of congressman al

true for working americans who will be worse off under yet another morally reprehensible republican budget this budget insults students attacks veterans and bankrupts future generations a budget is a statement about priorities for the party of tom delay and jack abramoff that means rewarding corporate contributors at the expense of ordinary americans republicans protected billions of dollars in giveaways to an oil industry awash in profits but despite president bushs state of the union rhetoric this budget underfunded investments in alternative energy that are necessary to prevent global warming what else do the republicans believe is less important than additional billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy education health care and the financial well being of our children and grandchildren despite record enrollment from prek to college republicans support large cuts to education this budget cuts department of education funding by 2 2 billionand provides 15 4 billion less

than 460 000 students lowcost higher education loans though 46 million americans lack health insurance the republican budget does nothing to improve access to quality careand actually includes policies that would increase the numbers of people without health insurance and who are underinsured rather than embrace necessary fixes to the medicare prescription drug program republicans instead chose to continue billions of dollars in overpayments to managed care plans and despite regularly thumping their chests while claiming to support the troops republicans propose 6 0 billion in cuts to veterans health care over five years many americans volunteer to serve their country but the republican party rarely serves them when george bush was elected president a satirical newspaper joked that our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity was finally over in the years since americans have leamed the republican record of warmongering and fiscal mismanagement is no laughing matter prior to this year republicans had already turned a 10year 5 6 trillion surplus and turned it into a 3 2 trillion deficit though this budget cowardly rails to include tens of billions in supplemental requests related to a misguided iraq war it nonetheless adds another 2 3 trillion to the rational debt over the next five years this budget makes clear what no amount of spin and lies can hide

opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight

and my next chart tells you who we are borrowing it from and they are owning a part of the american apple pie not because they had to pay 56 to fill up their f10 pickup truck not because of their

soldiers about the costs of this war and what it will take to ensure stability and security in iraq so our troops can return home instead of disclosing the actual findings of field reports on contracting audits troop needs or the projected cost of the reconstruction effort the administration has withheld distorted and even deliberately hidden information just this week despite the administrations refusal to turn pentagon audits over to congress i obtained a report by defense department auditors concluding that halliburton overcharged the unitedstates government more than 100 million for a single task order under its nobid 7 billion contract to restore iraqs oil infrastructure i would like to know why unredacted versions of this audit report and the audit reports on nine additional task orders are still being withheld from congress i have also learned that administration officials violated a u n security council resolution by intentionally concealing these overcharges from international auditors the administration only provided heavily redacted audits to the international auditors charged with overseeing the iraqi oil revenue used to pay halliburtons inflated costs worst of all correspondence between the army corps of engineers and halliburton officials indicates it was halliburton that blackedout references to egregious overcharges and other key audit findings regarding the unreasonableness of halliburtons prices i am deeply disappointed that the house voted down an amendment calling for the investigation of reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan including contracting procedures possible money laundering and profiteering it is disturbing that the republican leadership has been unwilling to assert its oversight responsibility and demand fiscal accountability the administration has not complied with congressional mandates to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the 200 billion already spent in iraq and afghanistan and a detailed assessment of the projected costs of military and reconstruction activities in iraq over the next 5 years the white house has failed to justify a permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthy while paying for the war with mounting deficits and massive budget cuts to social programs and when it comes to our troops it has been congress not the administration prioritizing force protection needs and the procurement of safety essentials like armored humvees body armor night vision equipment and jamming devices to neutralize the improvised explosive devices that are among the biggest threats to unitedstates patrols i am willing to support this supplemental precisely because it allocates a majority of funds for troop and equipment needs and training of iraqi security forces this is a vast improvement over the blank check requested by the administration to pursue its less accountable reconstruction efforts no matter how each of us feels about the administrations actions that led to war and its conduct since thenand i have been one of its strongest criticswe have an obligation to ensure that our troops have the support and equipment they need as long as they are in the field in addition the funding in this legislation for training and equipment for iraqi and afghan security forces is essential for these nations to take control of their own security so unitedstates troops can comehome some who oppose this legislation believe that its defeat would hasten the return of our troops although it is critically important for the unitedstates to develop an exit strategy i am deeply concerned that a prematurewithdrawal of unitedstates troops just after iraqs democratic elections and as its leaders attempt the difficult task of forming a coalition government would only embolden the aiqaeda cells fueling the insurgency in iraq i also strongly support other provisions of the legislation to pay for food aid and peacekeeping in the sudan as well as the more than 650 million allocated for relief and reconstruction to the countries devastated by the tsunami 1 fully support the 200 million included in this bill for economic revitalization and infrastructure development in the west bank and gaza the end of the arafat era presents a concrete opportunity for the palestinian people to chart a future away from terrorism corruption and incitement and toward democracy transparency and the rule of law this aid package is a strategic and timely investment in the leadership of palestinian president mahmoud abbas the accountability requirements in this bill will set an example for the international community for formulating assistance packages that protect against cronyism embezzlement and mismanagement which in the past siphoned millions of dollars to arafat

extend my thanks to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on trade the gentleman from maryland for his very very substantive review of this cafta treaty it has been an enormous help to members and i thank him for his leadership as well i rise in strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to improve environmental protection in central america and it will open up our own environmental laws to attack by foreign corporations my colleagues this cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new products and to create new markets for those goods and services we insist that this administration revisit its flawed trade policy and work with democrats so that we can pass free trade agreements including a new improved cafta that will expand markets spur economic growth protect the environment and raise living standards in the united states and abroad that would allow us to move forward with our other priorities american families are facing serious challenges rising health care costs record gas prices climbing college costs and massive job layoffs they are worried about the direction of our country instead of addressing the serious issues that directly affect americas families and coming up with real solutions repgblicans have abused their power and focused on the wrong priorities pursuing an energy bill that does nothing to lower gas prices or a social security privatization plan that weakens the safety net for americas elderly sadly this trade agreement and the way it has been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this

aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around

these incidents as crimesnot acts of warand providing reactionary measures rather than moving pro activelywill not work how do we know because that is precisely what we did for decadesand the consequence was 911 the attacks we witnessed that day serve as a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality now we could have easily stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free reign would not make us any saferhistory has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lostmore bombingsand not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorismthat is not living in liberty and freedom there are defining moments every generation must face for this generation that defining moment is how we engage in this war on terrorhighlighted by a very different post 911 world when we came to that defining momentthat tragic daywe as a nation with our allies around the world decided we would not allow terrorists to win the choice is clear our resolve is clear we will and

and the canadians which i did not realize that the canadians were involved in this they all got together to oust a duly elected president but now let me just tell you that from 2000 in florida this president was not duly elected i will say that because the election was stolen and we all know that the election was stolen and it is interesting that you would use invalid ballots blank ballots this is the same mechanism that was used to disenfranchise black people in this country in 2000 in the presidential election and so now of course they surface again in haiti invalid ballots blank ballots but the people of haiti took to the streets they demanded a fair vote count and they got a fair vote count and they got a president i want to thank my sister congresswoman for joining me on the house floor but also for those strong and powerful words because she is absolutely right that it is our responsibility now that the peoples voices have been heard and so now we have to respect that we need to respect that i want to shift gears for just a moment and i do not think this poster should present a surprise to anyone as to what i am going to talk about now and that is hurricane katrina i want to remind people of these images that went all over the world the black person who is trying to go through the water for food is looting that is what associated press writes that is what associated press wrote the black person was looting agence francepress saw these white people and they were finding bread and soda blacks loot whites find there is nothing more stark this is the beginning of the hurricane katrina story and this is the way hurricane katrina was portrayed to the american people and throughout the world we need to question all of the press images from not just associated press but every newspaper and on television what were our administration leaders doing as new orleans was filling with water the president was on vacation in texas at the ranch the vice president was on vacation in wyoming he was fly fishing the secretary of state was visiting new york city and even in the midst of what was happening in new orleans she got booed so the press reports tell us because she took in a play and then after she took in a play she went shopping for ferragamo shoes and bought 7 000 worth reportedly of ferragamo shoes and then after that she decided to play a little tennis donald rumsfeld took in a padres game in san diego and michael chertoff who is the secretary of the department of homeland security who is charged with taking care of the united states in a time of great trial and stress and catastrophe stayed at home so as a result the select committee that was formed by this congress to investigate the governments preparations for and actions during hurricane katrina issued a report yesterday the name of the report a failure of initiative it is a huge report the bottom line is that secretary chertoff needs to resign it is amazing to me to see the secretary on television through the powers of cspan doing an intellectual dance trying to defend the indefensible what happened to the people of the gulf states region and what is happening to them today is indefensible and if thousands of families are being kicked out of their temporary homes their temporary housing which was the hotel rooms that is the responsibility at the end of the secretary of the department of homeland security who said okay we will let fema go ahead with that call of course the president bears responsibility too and he has accepted responsibility but i have not yet heard secretary chertoff accept responsibility another sad fact about hurricane katrina and its aftermath is that in the metropolitan atlanta area we have about 60 to 70 000 katrina survivors they want to go back home many of them but there is so much uncertainty because as the congresswoman from florida said earlier there is still uncertainty as to how the hurricane katrinasurvivors are going to be treated i have introduced legislation that will force the epa to look at tests and make public the environmental circumstances under which people will be returning in particular to new orleans it is a shame that we would have to have legislation in order to get the epa to do its job but right now structures are being tested for habitability on their structural soundness but not on their environmental soundness and we have that toxic sludge that is everywhere so i would ask that this congress look at the omnibus piece of legislation that was dropped in and signed by all of the members of the congressional black caucus which addresses all aspects of the problem faced by those katrina survivors in addition i find it curious that the panel that produced this what some people are calling scathing report was boycotted by the democrats well it was boycotted by the democratic leadership i chose to participate in it because there is one thing about participating in congress we are elected we come here we write and we speak and everything that we write and speak for vive as long as there is a congressional record and academicians and scholars lawyers can search the congressional record to understand the environment within which certain actions were taken certain legislation was passed attorneys and judges all well as scholars and academicians and historians and archivists so the power that must not be thrown away i participated in the hearing and my remarks are included in the panels report but the leadership was suggesting that instead we needed an independent commission like the 9 11 commission i do not have a problem with an independent commission but to use the 9 11 commission as a paragon of an example of how you ferret out the truth and find out what actually happened in a tragic event i think is not appropriately stated because yesterday in the armed services committee we had three people who appeared before the armed services committee in n able danger hearing able danger is the data mining program that has been in the newspaler a lot because of the persistence of thb gentleman from pennsylvania one of our colleagues these experts from the military and from intelligence said that if they had been allowed to do their job their work product could quite possibly have prevented september 11 it provided the american intelligence community with the tools necessary to understand what was happening to our country in real time but the program was shut down and when efforts were made to brief the 9 11 commission on what this able danger work product had demonstrated and had shown their work was denigrated their work product was denigrated and they were not given an opportunity to present theirfindings to the commission as directly it has been said in public statements that their work was historically insignificant yet we have three people in open session yesterday say to us that if they had been allowed to do their job to do their work that quite possibly september 11 could have been prevented and instead of grasping on to this information the staff of the 9 11 commission said that these people were not credible and that the results that they touted were historically insignificant and therefore this program was ignored now i do not know why it was ignored but the gentleman from pennsylvania has had a lot to say about able danger and what it meant to our country and why it was shut down i would encourage people to pay attention to able danger and the hearings that7 the house armed services committee is having also there was one otaer thing very sad that came out of the hearing that we had yesterday and that is poor whistleblower treatment in fact whistleblower mistreatment and all kinds of allegations were made against average ordinary americans who had extraordinary jobs that put them in a position to know something and because they saw something was wrong and they tried to inform the higher ups that something was wrong they were personally mistreated at the workplace and away from the workplace even comments made about their peysonal and private lives e 1330 what that says to us is that we have got to do a better job in this place of allowing the truth to come out i remember when i was in congress during my previous tenure and at that time we were working very hard on unitedstates foreign policy in africa we wanted the truth to come out about the real events surrounding the rwandan geno cide it seemed that everybody who was associated with not telling the truth or making sure that we didnt get access to the truth got a promotion i have become fond of saying it seems that it is only in washington dc where you can be incompetent and get a promotion anywhere else in america if you are incompetent you lose your job but not so here in this country as we contemplate the enormity of what the able danger panelists told us in open testimony yesterday as we contemplate as a country the enormity of this revelation let us also weigh it against what is happening now what is happening now is that the war drums are beating once again i have a constituent who is over the age of 40 and he has been told he has got to report for duty to go to iraq over 40 the drumbeats for war are sounding not just against iraq now but also against iran and syria in the face of these beating drums the backdrop is that this administration is being investigated this administration being investigated has two februtry 16 2006 ongoing investigations the department of justice just opened another one today which makes this the third investigation the third investigation on wiretapping this administration is being investigated and has drawn indictments and a guilty plea the vice presidents former chief of staff lewis libby has been indicted and lawrence franklin who is being investigated by paulmcnulty has been sentenced for 12 years for passing classified material over to another country this administration is being investigated on how we got into the first war and now they want us to go to a second war to open another front on this war it is about time that we say no more war no more war mr bush i also want to as i remember the gentleman in my district who is over 40 years of age who has been told that he has got to report for duty in iraq remember kevin benderman whose wife frantically contacted my office asking for help for her husband kevin benderman went to iraq one time he was asked to do things that he thought as a human being went against his conscience we know that collateral damage is not just a number 100 000 200 000 it is people it is little boys and little girls it is women kevin benderman said i am not going t6 kill innocent people dont ask me to do that i have done it once once is too much he decided that he would apply for conscientious objector status well kevin benderman is in the brig because he did not want to kill innocent little girls and little boys and women and men in iraq he is in the brig last weekend there was an action to free kevin benderman its a shame i didnt expect to take all of my time but i was pleased that my sister from california chose to come down and say a few words of congratulations to the people of haiti and to the new presidentelect rene preval i was clicking around on the computer and i came across a very interesting article written by thom hartmann and it can be found on common dreams at commondreams org the title of it is rumsfeld and cheney revive their 70s terror playbook basically what they say in this article which i am going to submit for the record is that when they were in office before this dynamic duo decided to cook up an idea of soviet military dominance to frighten the american people and justify huge defense contracts or the huge defense budget which then would result in defense contracts let me just read they said that the soviets had a new secret weapon of mass destruction they succeeded in recreating an atmosphere of fear in the united states and making themselves and their defense contractor friends richer than most of the kingdoms of the world trillions of dollars and years later it was proven that they had been wrong all along and the cia had been right rumsfeld cheney and wolfowitz lied to america in the 1970s about soviet weapons of mass destruction and the soviet supersub technology but the cold war was good for business and good for the political power of its advocates from rumsfeld to wolfowitz to cheney who have all become rich in part because of the arms industry i am going to place this into the record because it appears that america has been through this before"], [0.00035706162452697754, 0.00035706162452697754, 0, "i work we know that they

colleagues said we need to have tonight as our colleagu~s across the some honesty as welook at this budget aisle have talked about their desire to process i am not going to disagree see things done differently as we look with that i certainly think as we get at our budget process ready for presidents day and thinking certainly there are those of us like about president lincoln and the monme who think that government is over iker honest abe that he carried with grown while there are others in this him we certainly need to remember body that think that government can that and have honesty but part of that not do enough there are those of us honesty is looking at this and remindwho want to prioritize and reduce the ing the american people one of the reabudget and there are those who do not sons we are faced with the budget we want to prioritize or reduce the budget have is because of this huge enormous they feel like something to do is to bureaucracy huge bureaucracy that keep the status quo and raise taxes and grew out of 40 years of democrat conapproach our responsibilities in that trol of this body a bureaucracy that way basically is a monument to them a couple of points i did want to it is so difficult and people have such touch on as they have talked about a tough time working through the buthe budget and talked about the deficit reaucracy whether it is paying your and talked about the concerns that we income tax figuring out that process have for that is we look at the overall figuring out that tax code whether it economic security of this great nation is the local university trying to get one of the things that we did when over here and get the bureaucracy to we passed the deficit reduction act help them with some program that is weich pas the deft brutond a needed for that university whether it which was a plan brought forward byisoroalomuty ndcny the majority in this house that would is our local community and county reduce what the federal government governments trying to figure out how spends and yield a savings for the to work with different agencies and american people what happened with comply with different regulations it is a cumbersome overgrown that deficit reduction act was yes we bloated bureaucracy and certainly as did achieve a reduction in what the we address the issues of oversight federal government spends this is the through the ratings tools through the first time in about 20 years that this presidents management initiative has happened we had a reduction in through the cfo act those are all acour discretionary spending countability measures that have come i think it is noteworthy into play since republican control of that we received not one democrat this body took place in 1994 vote for that bill for reducing spending so there is plenty that we can diswhile it is easy to say and certainly cuss and we will look forward to dismakes for great discussion and con cussing over the next month as we look versation that the deficit is too big at the budget look at the process look and that we are spending too much the at the need to put those parameters in proof is in the pudding place that will help us get the budget the proof is when it comes time to under control and still address the vote are you going to vote to raise areas of responsibility that we have taxes and spend more and keep the sta one of those areas of responsibility tus quo or are you going to vote to that i think we all can agree on and make some reductions to get in there certainly should be agreeing on is that

important it is for us to win in this war on terror and how important it is for us to realize that it is going to be a long war that it is about freedom and it exists not only in faraway lands like

been made of the contest had the renowned french tasters been less disdainful toward the california selections as they tasted the french tasters were stunned when the names of the wines were revealed the impact of the tasting for california wines was immediate showing people everywhere that exceptional wines could come from somewhere other than france the 1976 paris tasting has been duplicated

tape requirements which would delay longawaited regulations for food safety drinking water quality worker protections and pollution control even with the changes adopted during the last week s 343 is still a prescription for delay duplication and judicial gridlock s 343 is not true reform it is full of exemptions and special interest provisions unrelated to the basic bill or which give assistance to particular industries its provisions will swamp agencies with requirements for hundreds of new costly and timeconsuming analyses and it will undermine needed health safety and environmental regulations already on the books s 343 is filled with new opportunities for endless rounds of judicial review yesterday our colleague senator john kerry stated that the bill still contained 88 new places for court intervention in the regulatory process despite the efforts of many senators to improve this aspect of s 343 s 343 could result in the sunset of many regulations if agencies failed to review them accordingly to required time schedules even worse the schedules themselves might be manipulated by special interests who could overload agency review agendas and tie them up until regulations expired finally s 343 still includes language which favors the least cost and not the most costeffective regulationsan affront to common sense which could result in missed opportunities for sensible regulatory revisions mr president this country needs reguliltory reform regulated businesses and individuals deserve the most flexible costeffective regulations agencies can craft while still providing the protections congress has provided and all of us need but it is also time for us to admit the real cause of many regulatory complaints overly prescriptive and sloppily drafted

cells appear to have a far greater potential for treating disease than adult stem cells scientists regard embryonic stem cell research as one of the greatest hopes for the cure of medical conditions such as parkinsons disease and diabetes due to their unique ability to develop into virtually any type of cell in the body recently researchers at the university df miami came up with a technique to

conditions that arise during the critical period of early human growth other possible medical applications include the repair of crippling injuries such as spinal cord damage and the ability to correct the damaging side effects of existing medical treatments like chemotherapy this debate is not about whether or not embryonic stem cell research will progress for it surely will this research
