votes of their representative in congress i take great pleasurein carrying on this tradition during this 97th congress at this time as we move into the final hours of the 1st session of the 97th congress i would like to submit the first congressional district yearend report these have been an exciting 12 months to be in washington i believe history will record this first session of this congress as one of the most significant farreaching legislative sessions of this century by actions taken this year this congress has begun a redirection of our national government in many cases the changes wrought will restore to individual citizens and families a measure of control over their lives and pocketbooks which had been surrendered to a federal government grown too expensive too expansive and too burdensome in other instnces the new direction will begin the necessary revitalization of our national defense and restoration of a strong clear and consistent foreign policy swhile rnany major issues have been addressed by this congress it has ween the economy which has ltaken the greatest amount of time and attention that concern by the congress of course only reflects the concern of the people of new york and the rest of the united states it also is true that congress in this first session has reflected the national will and desire for a meaningful ch ange from business as usual in washington at his inaugural in january this year president reagan called for a new beginning in midmarch he came before us in a joint session of congress to lay out a fourpoint economic recovery plan to meet the challenges of that auspicious theme for his administration the programs four major elements designed to complement one another were first cutting the growth of federal spending second reduction of tax burdens third regulatory reform and fourth controlling money and credit now only 9 months later the planks of that program directly affected by congressional action are in place or soon will becofie effective in major showdowns this year with opposing elements in congress determined to derail the economic recovery plan the presidents program repeatedly prevailed much of the credit for those successes lies with the people i received hundreds of letters and phone calls from the people of the first congressional district not all supported the presidents plan in every instance but a recurrent theme running through many of those messages was it may not be perfect but the presidenits plandeserves a chance i have supported most of what the administration has proposed in its attempts to launch a new beginning those of us elected by the people are not sheep to be led by the executive branch on occasion the interests of the people of the first congressional district run counter to an administration plan in those cases i have voted or acted accordingly but for the most part the policies and programs of this administration have warranted the support i and others have given them what we have accomplished in pursuit of the presidents economic recovery plan is truly impressive we have lowered personal income taxes by 5 percent as of october 1 with additional 10 percent reductions planned for july 1981 and july 1983 those 25percent acrosstheboard reductions will mean more money for the persons who earn it to decide how to spend not some bureaucrat in washington we also have insured that for the first time the government no longer will profit from continued inflation beginning in 1986 personal income tax rates and personal deduction will be adjusted or indexed for inflation this willmean the end of the bracket creep s by which salary and wage increases onlyboosted individuals into higher tax brackets where governiment takes a larger bite december 15 1981 coi we have put into place incentives for businesses to invest in new plant and equipment in order to operate more efficiently and create new jobs we have enacted major incentives for individuals to save more money and thus help create the capital needed for investment and economic growth as well as to better provide for themselves and their families for the future we have added extra incentives for individual initiative by insuring that a farmer or small businessmans lifetime effort and investment benefits his family not the tax collector by easing the inheritance tax rates that destroy many family farms and enterprises other benefits we have enacted as part of the taxreduction plan include new deductions for couples who work reducing the marriage penalty new charitable deductions for those who do not itemize on their tax returns an increase in the amount of money that can be put into an individual retirement account ira or keogh retirement plan with persons already oovered by a pension program at work allowed for the first time to set up an ira too in order to help workers to better save arid plan for their later years i believe it is worthwhile to reassess how far we have come in improving the economy this year to understand where we are today we have to recall where we stood at this time last year tinder the last administration when jimmy carter took office in 1977 inflation was running at 4 8 percent when he left office inflation had risen to a 12 4 percient per year rate under the reagan administration inflation is down to a 9 5 percent annual rate just last month consumer price rises were holding at 4 4 percent annual rate clearly we are turning the tide on inflation and it is this lowered inflation which offers the greatest encouragement for those on fixed or low incomes who have been hurt most by the soaring inflation of recent years when jimmy carter took office in 1977 the prime interest rate was 6 25 percent when he left office it was up to a high of 21 5 percent now it is down to 15 5 percent and stilll heading downward ~when jimmy carter took office federal spending wa s increasing at a rate of 12 3 percenta year when he left off ide the spending growth rate was 14 percent the latest estimate of the growth in spending uinder the reagan administration is 10 6 percent for fiscal 1982 one area where we have not seen as much improvement is in unemployment unemployment inthe last quarter of 1980 was 7 5 percent during the same period this year it is 8 percent as regrettable as that high figuire is there are signs of hope one purpose of the reaganeconomic program is to increase savings and investment needed to create jobs during all of 1980 only 300 000 new jobs were created this year there have been 730 000 new jobs created so we are seeing some progress although clearly not enough we have begun to fulfill the mandate of the people we have cut spendingfor fiscal years198284 by 167 billion in budget authority and by 131 billion in actual budget outlays we have reduced the tax burden for fiscal 1982 from the 22 1 percent of the gross national product projected by the carter administrationto only 20 4 percent under the reagan administration what we have been doing is painful but i believe the people of the first congre ssional district continue to realize we can endure some shortterm pain in order to get a longterm gain the primary responsibility of an elected representative is to insure that the voice of his constituents is heard on the issues that is why i have maintained a higher than average attendance record on the floor of the house the place where final amendments are proposed and the place of ultimate judgment i am proud to say that in the 3 years i have served in congress i have been present for 95 percent of the more than 1 800 recorded votes conducted in that time issues which took on very special significance in this congress were the preservation of blean drinking water and clean air my own efforts in this behalf have been helped by becoming the ranking minority member of the science and technology committees subcommittee on natural resources agriculture research and the environment on long island we have a particularly keen interest in clean water because of our total dependence on underground aquifers for our drinking water this year i have worked with state and local officials as well as federal agencies to enhance efforts to insure a pure drinking water sup ply for suffolk county and all of long island i take particular pride in being able to use my subcommittee position for the betterment of our environmental quality on long island next session we look forward to rewiiting the clean air act this is one proposal that will get my very close attention when we get done rewriting that law i want to be able to gay we have mfore effective protection of the peoples health through enhancing the quality of the air they breathe the security of our nation is an essential federal priority because of this it has been my pleasure to support the president ii his efforts to bolb ster our national detense effort which slipped badly in recent years on november 18 i voted for the 197 4 billion defirnse appropriations bill on longisland we are proud of our contributiont to the national defense economists have calculated that the long island economy will realize a 1 billion boost as a result of the 1982 defense spending bill the core of our defense program remains the men and women who serve in the military service in september i supported the 14 3percent increase in basic pay for all military personal a move which should help retain the experienced personnel needed to operate our sophisticated modern military with its allvolunteer force our national debt to those who serve us all in the military continues after their service this year we in the house enacted three major veterans bills all of which i supported signed into law on november 3 was the veterans health care training and small business loan act of 1981 a major provision in that law provides medical help for the first time through the veterans administration for vietnam veterans exposed to the herbicide agent orange who developed health problems as a result the veterans disability compernsation housing and memorial benefits amendments became law in october among other provisions that law increased disability compensation for disabled veterans and their dependents or survivors by 11 8 percent effective october 1 the third measure to become law was the former prisoner of war benefits act of 1981 we in the house also passed two veterans bills which the senate now must approve one would strengthen the va medical system the other would create a variablepayment home loan program to help veterans buy houses in times of high interest rates there is one last item which i want to particularly note for the people of the first congressional district because it has the potential of overshadowing all else we have done i refer to president reagans historic peace initiative announced on november 18 at that time he issued a challenge to the soviet union a challenge not of war but of peace eacll of the four points in his plan is highly significant but the most critical is the offer to cancel the placement of new nuclear defense missiles in europe if the soviet union will dismantle the strategic missiles it already has in place targeted on western europe this is a call for the beginning of a mutual disarmament if that disarm ament can be adequately verified the strategic arms reduction talks start which president reagan called for have the potential of becoming the turning point in the worlds prospects for a true and lasting peace a peace without the threat of a nuclear holocaust the voting summary printed below represents the highlights of the recorded votes taken by the house in 1981 i have tried to represent your interests to the very best of my ability the congressional office of new you i welcome your advice and com working with you in

more p rofitable nionutlity businesses 2 this countrys utilities arc experiencing serious financial difficulties which if allowed to continue would have a devastating impact upon the nation and its citizens and industry dependent upon reliable electric and gas utility service as many of us know the common stocks of electric utilities are selling well below their book values and lowered bond ratings have resulted in higher interest charges that are ultimately passed on to consumers these factors have caused the utility industry as well as other concerned citizens to explore the possibilities of diversification as a means of improving the industrys financial performance and stability and contributing to the wellbeing of the nations energy resources the act was passed in 1935 to correct a series of abuses by electric and gas utility holding companies notably excessive pyramidding of corporate structures and stock watering at the time a handful of holding companies controlled virtually the entire utility business in the nation these holding companies operated in disparate parts of the country and were not subject to effective state regulation in the view of the congress the power and interstate character of these holding companies rendered state control over such abuses ineffective and required that authority over them be conferred upon the securities and exchange commission the principal purpose of the act as noted in the legislative history was to nsure effective state regulation by reorganizing these holding companies into geographically contiguous units virtually all of the questionable practices the act was designed to correct were securities and accounting ones not unique to the utility industry as such they probably would have been eliminated over time by the thennew securities act~ of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 both of which turned out to be far more effective than anticipated accounting standards and practices have improved dramatically since the mid1930s moreover the regulation of public utilities on the state level is considerably more effective today than when the act was passed since state utility laws have now evolved into~ strong comprehensive regulatory systems thus present federal and state regulation is drastically different from that of the early 1930s and there is little likelihood those problems would recur in the face of regulatory scrutiny under federal and state laws other than the act the bill allows both independent electric and gas operating companies to form exempt holding companies it also allows exempt holding companies to diversify without later being subject to arbitrary sec revocation of their exemptions the bill would apply to all electric and gas utilities with the exception of registered holding companies i recognize that there are a number of issues relating to utility diversification and the act that need to be addressed i hope introduction of this legislation will encourage early hearings on this subject earlier this year hearings on the subject of least cost energy strategies for the utility industry were held by chairman ottinoers energy conservation and power subcommittee in fact it was at a september 10 hearing of that subcommittee that i first discussed the possibility of the need for the congress to consider the impact of the act on the financial health of the utility industry subsequently i sent a questionnaire regarding the act to approximately 150 utility executives and each of the 50 statepublic service commissions in reviewing the act we must look at the likely impact of diversification on investors and consumers alike secondly one must view utility diversification in the context of the nations overall energy posture and the development of its renewable and alternative energy resources finally we should address specific questions that maybe of concern to regulators and investors alike such as whether the holding company structure with separate corporate subsidiaries for utility and nonutility businesses as providedin the bill adequately protects against cross subsidization between the utility business and the nonutility business and possible competitive effects in the marketplace particularly among small businesses i consider the financial health of the utility industry to bean important issue 1 look forward to further addressing this matter in the ensuing months for the benefit of our colleagues i would like to include in the record at this point the text of the public utility financial reform act h r 5220 a bill to amnend the public utility holding company act of 1935 to improve financial performance of electric and gas utilities by removing unnecessary regulatory impediments to the exercise of sound and prudent business judgment by utility executives be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled"],

record i wish to report that this past saturday it was my honor and privilege and personal satisfaction to address the annual rio orande united methodist church conference which is an historical one perhaps the most historical of all the meetings in that particular church or christian denomination in the southwest united states to give my colleagues an idea of its historicity all of the transactions in the official proceedings of the conference are in spanish because there are spanishspeaking delegates from both the states of new mexico as well as texas and even some delegates from northeastern mexico the meeting is evocative of a history of the united states that has yet to be written that particular developmental history in the southwest border country and particularly the 20year period known as the mexican revolutionary period stretching from about 1910 to 1930 this conference is really unique as a matter of fact it is a separate and apart annual conference from the main southwest conference of the methodist church which was celebrated in my district in san antonio tex the heart of the city in fact at a place adjacent to the alamo just a few days prior to the rio grande conference last saturday but it is nevertheless an integral part of methodism the rio grande conference took place at georgetown tex at another historical site the southwestern university which has been in existence 141 years and is a substantial educational institution with a tremendous background of service to methodism and in imparting education to the people of texas it is a beautiful campus it has grown tremendously just in the last 20 years since i served in the texas state senate and had ccasion last to go to the campus in any event i feel it was a real privilege to attend this particular conference last saturday the methodist bishop for the region bishop ernest dixon was there the vice president of the university william b jones was also there and there were more than 1 000 persons present at this great conference the discussion that i was asked to develop was the developing eighties the decade of the eighties and the role of the ethnic minorities i will insert in the record at this point the substance of the address that i gave in pursuance of that request i am grateful to have the opportunity to be here ith you and spend a few minutes reflecting on the eternal dilemma where do we go from here there are never any easy answers or sure road signs to guide us in lifes conflicts no matter how great or small those might be we travel with certainty only when we move on the basis of firm faith it is so in daily life it is so in academic life it ia so in political life therefore when you ask me to talk about the role of minoritles in the eighties you are asking me to describe a map that does not really exist except in faiththe faith that we can even in the resurgent spirit of a new knownothing age of politics still find ways to improve the lot of people who are all too often left behind left out and left hurt in the great swirl and hubbub of our society we know at the outset in the words of herman melville that there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not progress through fixed gradations there is no way that we can with certainty say what this decade will bring or what we will be like at the end of it all we can know is that we have to strive for the best that is within ourselves and seek to commit this country to do the best that it can for all of its people there is in any country any society the temptation to be complacent to shut out the afflictions and problems of the unfortunate this is no less true of our great country than of any otherbut still there is a redeeming optimism that prevails in our country most of us believe that there are very few problems of any kind that cant be licked that is why americans didnt let the prairie be the end of the westward movement there might have been less water and little wood in the westbut americans discovered that you did not have to have wood or stone to build fences you could use wire and you did not have to have water in streams you could drill deep wells and bring the water from the earth by using the power of the wind and just as we have tended to be inventive and practical so have we realized that social problems can be licked too sometimes our efforts to help our fellow man have been terrible failuresprohibition was a disasterbut far more often we have found that there are ways and means of helping our fellow human beings overcome the viscissitudes of life so we have been optimists i like to think that our general optimism has also made us idealists justice brandeis who himself sprang from a class who were subjected to the most odious kind of discrimination found it in his heart to say this there is in most americans some spart of idealism which can be fanned into flame it takes sometimes a divining rod to find out what it is but when found the results are extraordinary we know from history and the events of our own lives that idealism is a real and present thing in our society where else but in america would anyone dream up an idea as outlandish and as outlandishly successful as the peace corps where else but in america would we find a president inviting as franklin roosevelt did the daughters of the american revolution to think of themselves aa immigrants where else but in america could there have been the great civil rights movement that mighty and creating wave of equality and dignity that expressed itself in words of idealism and faith that no one could ever forget we shall overcome we shall overcome i do believe we shall overcome some day nowhere but in america could you find that kind of movement born in faith nourished by optimism and fueled by pure ideal lam crystallized in those words and now here we stand the fight for simple access won here we stand knowing that the real fight is only now beginning for it means nothing it we have the right to walk into the hamburger joint if we lack the money to buy the burger it means nothing to have the right to apply for a job if we dont have decent schools to equip us for that job it means nothing to have the right to buy or rent a home if there are no homes to buy or rent the fight of the civil rights movement was a fight for access the fight today is much harder than that it is the fight for the mainstream the fight for economic opportunity and this is the key it is not a fight only for the minority people of this country it is a fight for all the people of this country in the state of texas about a third of the population could be considered a member of one minority or another about one texan in five as hispanic about one texan in eight is a black it is true that when you talk about unemployment when you talk about low income and when you talk about poor education and when you talk about poor nutrition those are problems that fall first and hardest and most often on the ml nority population of this state but when you talk about absolute numbers there are twice as many poor anglos in texas as there are poor hispanics there are four times more poor anglos in texas than there are poor blacks therefore when we talk about the fight for economic opportunity we are not merely talking about a fight of by and for blacks and hispanics we are talking about a fight for all poor people when we talk about how republican budget cuts hurt poor people we too often forget that the greatest number of the poor are not minorities at all but anglos for all poor people the fight in thin decade is to reach the mainstream the point where most americans live a decent job a decent education a decent home and a decent meal on the table because so many in the minority population are poor this effort to reach the mainstream is too easily seen as simply a minority struggle such an image is wrongfor the problems of all poor and struggling people are different only in degree and there is no degree of difference in the pain of poverty a hungry stomach does not differentiate between races in the civil rights struggle the key was to awaken the realization that civil rights was h 2778 co not just a concern of black people it was a concern of all people i remember vividly that when i fillbustered aainst the infamous segregation bills of the fifties i did not merely arousd the hatred of rednecks and the suspicions of the fbi my own friends said they were disappointed in me that i was trying to reduce my own hispanic brothers down to the level of blacks but what was any different about laws that tried to exclude me from certain housing right along with blacks what was any different about me being excluded from a public park right along with blacks what harmed blacks harmed me and what offended any human being offended all human beings there are many keys to the economic mainstream it takes more to reach that mainstream than to have an opportunity for a job it is necessary to be equipped for that job and so for many the main thing is to stay in school to gain skills we have done well in that task in the last decade and the progress for minorities has been encouraging and yet even today among adult hispanics in texas only a third have finished high school blacks by contrast can count half their adult number as being high school graduates meanwhile twothirds of the anglos have completed a high school education therefore for a third of the anglo population half the black population and twothirds of the hispanic population education remains a supreme priority without education and without skill the door to opportunity may be open but the threshold remains too high to cross what that educational attainment means is this a third of the anglo population of this state lives on an income of less than 6 000 a year close to 60 percent of hispanics and blacks on that kind of income 500 a month here in texas if you have less than four years of education it doesnt make much difference what your ethnic background is black white or brown anybody with less than a fourth grade education is twothirds of the time working at a low wage blue collar job of one kind or another there is nothing dishonorable about hon orable workbut what i am saying is that staying in school is the first prerequisite to entering americas true mainstream and that is the upwardly mobile population the population that moves up the ladder rather than being forced to stay on the same level unable to move ahead if we have to be concerned about education we have to doubly concerned about the forces that are threatening our schools today all across texas there is resentment about property tax levels our states teachers are inadequately paid and they get nothing like the respect their jobs entitle them to but most alarming of all is the fact that at the same time the reagan budget programs intends to cut federal aid to schools by 25 percent what this means for disadvantaged people is that it will be next to impossible for schools to provide the kind of remedial and special education in the eighties that they did in the seventiesthis at a time when test scores are confirming that those programs have worked and worked wellthis at a time when we know that the investment in human potential has truly paid off just this week the house education and labor committee driven by the fantastic budget cuts imposed by the republican budget voted to kill future funding for the impacted areas assistance program this can if the decision sticks have disastrous effects on schools in san antonio that have no conceivable way to relay on local taxes to make up the differ ence and we are seeing moves to dismantle federal aid to the handicapped here in texas the clients of the texas rehabilitation commission last year reported a total income of 19 million before rehabilitation training after that training their income went up to 120 million the cost about 25 million vocational rehabilitation pro duced in other words an increase in income of four dollars for every single dollar that was invested in that training yet that program atands in clear danger today i think that if we but had the instruments to measure it we would see that education of every kind produces the same kind or return on investment for the poor and disadvantaged there is absolutely no doubt that the chances of getting a job increases with each additional year of school and the quality and income from that job likewise increase with each additional year spent in school and for that reason i think that ethnic minorities need first to be concerned about maintaining educational opportunities in the eightiesand this is a concern of every citizen rich or poor black or white i have said much about education and i underscore the importance of education as the key to economic opportunity but i do not want to leave the impression that the struggle ends there if there is no job to be had qualifications and skills make no difference if there is no food in the house it does not matter how great the schools are hunger and learning arent compatible if there is no roof to live under no clothing to wear it does not matter if the schools are outstanding we have to be concerned with overall economic program we have to be concerned with programs that make it possible to realize human potential when an administration creates dellberately an economic program that forces high interest rates upon uswe have to under stand that those interest rates forcea general economic slowdown a general rise in unemployment a general rise in small business bankruptcles those are the things that fall hardest on those who have the least to begin withand most particularly on minority groups does the building industry have trouble then we have to reali2 that the small builders and the small suboontractorsa great many of whom are minority persons struggling for a break throughare hit first hardest and longest of all does the auto industry have trouble it is the assemblyline worker the car salesman the mechanics who suffer the first blows the hardest knocks and the greatest struggle do the banks cut off loans we have to understand that it is the corner grocer the neighborhood dry cleaner the independent merchant who really suffers the consequences in each and every case it is not just the minority who sufferit is every struggling person in this country who suffers what we have to look for them is ways and means to make common cause with everyone who shares the concerns and burdens of proverty or handicaps of one kind or another it was making that common cause that allowed the great civil rights breakthrough now that we are looking for economic opportunity the fight is far more complex far more subtle far more difficultbut it can only be won in the same way by making common cause with all who are poor all who are oppressed all who need help and all who care about human decency what we cannot afford is to become locked in some sterile selfisolation not long after the civil war walt whitman wrote a great essay democratic vistas we have to understand that whitman loved this country as few others could he saw its greatness torn assunder he worked in military hospitals around wash ington and witnessed the terrible tragedy of war and he had mourned the death of lincoln and yet despite all that he looked to the future and saw a nation which he said would eventually have lorty or fifty great states and he saw in america a place where every individual could realize the best in himself he saw equality for women he saw the building of a unique ideal society and he saw the dangers of injustice and isolation he might have been thinking of todays demands for blind conformity when he wrote the great word solidarity has risen of all dangers to a nation as things exist in our day there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off by a line drawnthey not privileged as others but degraded humiliated made of no account what he was saying was this we can neither allow ourselves to be cast into ethnic stereotypes nor can we put ourselves into such a mold just as we would not have society put us into an isolated box neither should we in our own pride impose rigid conformity on ourselves in whitmans vision of americs every man and woman would be unique would honor their own roots but be free to reach out in all directions to other people other citizens he saw american individualism as not that half only i which isolates there is another half which la adhesiveness or love that fuses ties and aggregates making the races comrades and fraternizing all whitman lived and wrote at a time of great national disillusionment the din of disputation rages around me he wrote acrid the temper of the parties the president sends his message reconstruction is in abeyance the nomination and the contest for the twentyfirst presidential draw close with loudest threat and bustle but he did not despair of these and all the like of these the eventuations i know not but well i know that behind them and whatever their even tuations the vital things remain safe and certain and all the needed work goes on so are we in an age of disiluslonment the industrial world sees slow growth and no way to cope with the insidious effects of inflationand so the rich intend to build their walls higher and surround their wealth with moats fearing that they might lose everything the politics of the administration today is a new period of knownothingsome thing that whitman knew very well the administration puts its civil rights litigation on hold it spends all its energies dismantling education housing and employment programs saying that when the economy is right everyone will be all right but they ignore and forget the experience of our own past it was only in the sixties that we had ideal economic conditions like those stock man promlaes yes in the sixties we had low unemployment we had low inflation and we had rapid growth but we also had millions who were left out of the general prosperity millions who has no way to latch onto the promise of americathe promise that they too could become the kind of individuals we all want to bethe promise that every man and wolman could realize their full potential we discovered then that general prosperity and stability does not bring with it automatjune a 1981 co ic success for everyone there are those for whom the door may be open but the threshold too high to step over there are those who struggle for food for the bare necessities of life for any kind of hope at all that ia why we had riots in the midst of plenty there was despair and that is why the new knownothing age is so dangerous it ignores the reality that even when there is plenty even when there is economic stability there are those who need help to survive and to realize their share of the dream for us then for those of us who are ethnic minorities and for those who care about people who are in need this is the task of the eighties we must first and foremost defend the basic civil rights that have been so hard won after all as melville warns the gradetions of progress arent automatic and retracing our steps is a possibility it would be tragic to forget that vigilance is not only prudent but absolutely necessary in an age where the president aims to tear down the structures that protect civil rights from affirmative action right down to the elemental human rights of prisoners secondly we must concentrate our energies and resources on the fight for economic opportunityfor it means little or nothing to have the right to ride the bus if we cant serape up the money to buy the ticket or to enter school where there are no books and third we must make common cause with others when the civil rights of some are threatened the civil rights of all are threatened when poverty afflicts minorities it also afflicts those who are not in our number we cannot let ourselves be isolated or work in ways that isolate ourselves the great strength of this country as whitman observed is in its diversity he saw in us a great rolling massindividual and yet united no matter how great the concern how far the vision sooner or later we come down to one single solitary soul and so it is with us we have to concern ourselves with the greatest good for the greatest number and yet we can never forget that for people of faith and people of good will we can never forget the individual dignity and worth of each single solitary soul that is what our country is about it is what our faith is about and it is what our task is about if we maintain civil rights if we achieve economic opportunity we can only do it as part of a great nation that remains dedicated to the achievement of individual potential a nation that prizes most of all its own people that is why the song reads we shall overcome black and white together we shall overcome i do believe"], [0.004164397716522217, 0.9958356022834778, 1, "i want to

other been drastically cut in ways that especlally hurt poor people older people handicapped people and those on fixed incomes in spite of this even more cuts are planned in all areas of the country the fiscal year 1983 budget proposals affecting afdc food stamps energy assistance medicaid and housing assistance programs will make poverty a more severe and permanent condition for millions of lowincome families we will see reduced funding to the supplemental food program for women infants and children establishing in its place an expanded block grant the proposed budget will not produce anticipated cost savings for the federal government these cuts have nothing to do with balancing the budget or helping the economy all theyll do is punish poor people who will endure greater poverty according to the census bureau in 1980 13 percent of the population or 29 3 million people had incomes below the poverty level this includes 15 7 percent of those over age 65 32 5 percent of black and 25 7 percent of hispanic families we foresee proposed changes in regulations under title vi and ix of the civil rights act which would limit the forms of discrimination prohibited by the act permit certain forms of direct student aid to go to discriminatory schools and permit schools receiving government grants to discriminate in programs not directly funded by the federal government these changes would significantly limit civil rights protections by redefining what constitutes a violation and by limiting the definition of who has standing to challenge violations that occur the existence of the legal services corporation is being threatened while in the meantime has been severely limited in its ability to bring class action suits against the states on behalf of poor people challenging discrimination anyone advocating major changes on civil rights enforcement from within the administration has to understand that in the aftermath of such clear disasters as the irs tax exemption proposals for discriminatory private schools the administration has no credibility on these issues briefly other issues facing severe cuts are in the area of education an additional cut is being proposed of 24 percent in the federal per pupil expenditure for title i which supports special education programs for educationally disadvantaged children in lowincome schools in addition to the administrations proposed cuts the department of education has cuts of its own planned for title i the department of education is considering using 1970 census data in calculating esea title i allot ments to the states this would result in the loss of hunderds of millions of dollars for states throughout the country in title i funds additional reductions of 19 percent in educational assistance to handicapped children has been proposed this would affect 4 5 million handicapped children and reduce the average per pupil federal contribution from 246 to 180 or 7 percent of average student costs additional cuts of 32 percent in vocational rehabilitation programs and the elimination of 36 percent of the number of individuals participating in the programs has been called for along with a 32percent reduction in federal aid for vocational and adult education there will be reductions in bilingual education assistance by 32 percent and the elimination of all library program funds including public college and research libraries a number of changes are being pushed for aid to higher education including large reductions in fell grants and other direct aid to college students as well as significant increases in the cost of borrowing money through guaranteed student loans if the administration succeeds in eliminating the graduate student loan program or in charging commercial interest rates for student loans then large numbers of minority students will be forced out of higher education all of the traditionally black colleges estimate that they would have to close their doors and almost no blacks or other minority students would be able to attend graduate school we can also expect that teacher training programs would be eliminated at most colleges since high commercial interest rates plus loan initiation fees would eliminate the credit eligibility of everyone except those students with limited financial need it is no coincidence that efforts to defund public education come at a time when minority students represent a majority of the public school population in many cities the council of great city schools an association of 28 of the nations largest school systems estimates that of the 5 million students in these 28 systems 75 percent are minority and 30 percent have incomes below the poverty levels in those areas30 percent cuts have been proposed in direct funding to these schools which will increase to 40 percent over the next 2 years when inflation is factored in i oppose these cuts because they are shortsighted and unnecessary in terms of the economic resources of this country i think they also represent a fundamental reversal of the unitedstates policy of providing access to quality health care and education and a reasonable standard of living for all people"], [0.006060600280761719, 0.9939393997192383, 1, "first i wish to express my sincere grief and sorrow at the passing of our distinguished colleague from ohio mr ashbrook whose funeral services are being held today and as i understand it the reason why we have no legislative business this afternoon though the gentleman from ohios philosophy of government and mine may perhaps be described as quite different if not diametrically opposed i had nothing but respect and appreciation for his dignified manner his behavior and his record as a member of this house today i continue the effort along the lines and in pursuance of the two resolutions and the two bills that i have introduced with respect to the federal reserve board the absolute need for the congress to revise the structure that results from passage in 1913 by the congress of the federal reserve act of 1913 and the resolutions in which i am calling for the impeachment of the chairman of the federal reserve mr paul volcker as well as the supplementary resolution that equally calls for the impeachment of the open market committee which means the board plus the five private bankers that serve on this tremendous powerful socalled open market committee which as i guess most if not all my colleagues know is hardly open at all now i have in the past outlined the case i reported to the house that because of the reply i had received from the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to my request that my resolutions be considered seriously and his reply which i have inserted in the record and will not refer to it nowin which he indicated that for reasons pressures and numerous business pending in that committee he could not commit the committee to look into the matter in the immediate foreseeable future but that he was instructing the staff to evaluate the case i have not had any kind of response if any indeed has been forthcoming from that staff so i announced to the house that in view of the fact that i was indeed earnest and that despite some interpretations of these efforts that having no other recourse i would have to do the next best thing as the gentlemen conversant with our rules know in the case of a bill that is improperly bottled up by an arbitrary committee or chairman of a committee we have recourse to the discharge method by which if we get the required number that is half plus one of the membership to sign a discharge petition that committee is discharged of that matter and the matter is presented to the full house but in my case and for this reason i follow this route i intend to fully exercise the prerogatives under the rules of the house and under the applicable rules to this kind of resolution for it is a house resolution and therefore under the rules it is amenable to consideration by the house at the proper time and i intend to do that since that is my intention i then announced to the house that i would conduct the equivalent of a proceeding in a committee such as the judiciary of the impeachment process and ry first two statements in pursuance of that the last made about a week before the easter recess i laid the bare outlines and established the beginning of a predicate in a legislatively and legal or statutory method as to the conception the range and the applicability of article 2 section 4 of the constitution with respect to the jurisdictional coverage of that section to such officers as the federal reserve board chairman there is no question about it and i think that that is no obstacle whatsoever as a matter of fact it was insinuated in the chairmans reply to me that the chairman of the judiciary committee that he ful y appreciated the intention and thrust of my resolutions and considered it serious and worthwhile that is in other words constitutionally responsible which is fine and i am grateful for that but nevertheless i feel impelled to lay out the case so to speak so today in pursuance of what i am going to engage in that area of prime cause for my motivation in following this kind of activity or channel of action so to speak for several years as a matter of fact more than severalfirst going back to 1965 i addressed to this house to my colleagues on the banking committee a committee that i have served on for 20 yearsbetter than 20 years since i first came to the congressand addressed myself to the president at that time lyndon johnsonconcerning what was obvious to me then and that was that the factors that had for one reason or another be it war be it domestic policy or being the policies of war though undeclaredand the consequence that was apparent in the year 1965 as reflected in all of the reports the annual report of the federal reserve board unfortunately i found that even though every member particularly of the committee gets a copy of the annual report very few bother to leaf through it or look at it but that was something that i have always done since being on the committee plus my general interest in the field of fiscal and monetary policies which i consider to be the critical area as a matter of fact to personalize a bit when i first was elected to the congress during the campaign for this seatthe opposition made a big issue about the absolute need to have a guarantee no matter who won that race he would be assigned to the armed services committee because of the nature of the district and its overwhelming dependence on federal policies with respect to defensesan antonio my home base is traditionally a city that has had a stake in national defense since its founding in the days and in the times of the spanish control of that part of thiscountry it has been an outpost of defense since its very founding in 1718 and today it is one of the great pillars of our national defense composite and therefore this issue was raised politically it was a safe issue to raise by the oppolition because the democrats were in the majority the rules and the precedents of the texas delegation were rigorously based on seniority and there was a great desire for joinder to the armed services committee so those texans who had been in the congress several terms had indicated that that is exactly the post they wanted remembering that my predecessor was the ranking member of the armed services committee at the time he departed congress however since i had had some experience 5 years in the state senate of the state of texas i knew what was proper and what would be properly committed and promised and of course i never made that an issue when i got here i realized that even though the opportunity was afforded me by the then speaker of the house who told me that the president of the united states had called to ask if anything could be done to see that i would be assigned to the armed services committee i was not aware of that until the speaker called me in when he did he laid it out he said now congressuman the only way that can be done is if we find some way of enlarging that committee and if we can overcome the resistance of your own colleagues from texas who obey strict seniority he said we can strong arm we can strong muscle but i wanted to talk to you and i said no i did not come up and choose to seek this position to do anything other than to be a member of the house and legislate as a member what would follow thereafter committee assignments and the like i was perfectly content to follow the precedents and the rules and that the only time i would raise cane would be if i april j8 1982 was shortchanged or if i was discriminated against and then i told the speaker you will know what it means for me to get aroused i said i want to explain to you that i faced the same thing when i was elected to the texas state senate in 1956 like a revolution in my country and i found our great system to its everlasting glory still works and it is strictly up to you no matter what kind of committee assignment a man gets if his range of interest is in any particular field pftrticularly on the congressional level there is no reason he cannot have ample opportunity to discharge that pentup interest or that expertise he might possess no matter what his committee assignment is i want to say that because my answer to the constituents at that time since i had the honor of being immediately referred to a standing committee at that time known as the banking and currency committeeand though there were already three of us simultaneously sworn in on january 10 1962 i was the only one of the three that got assigned to a full standing committee the other two had to wait until the next congress so when i went back home i said i know that an issue had been made but i want you to know this too banking finances fiscal matters and all are one of my pet areas of interest and no matte how much you ntay think a man can do on the armed services committee or any american thinks he can do on behalf of defense if the cur rency of the nation has no value you have very little ability to fund the proper defense now that i think of those words i am struck by the appropriateness of that thinking today because that is the issue but all along when i spoke out and addressed myself to president johnson in 1965 i pointed out that it is going to be inescapable that one of two things happened soon and quickone was it was inflation or high interest rates and that our history showed us that unless specific action were taken both on the executive level as well as the congressional levelthat it was inevitable unfortunately there was no success on my part this has been the story of my careerin some cases it has taken as long as 10 years before i have had completion of an action that i initiated and so i am used to that we come to the great beauty of our system and our system is so great that if a man or a woman is right and if he has any kind of survivability that is if you can live long enough politically eventually you will be heard and if you have any kind of e lciency in presenting the cause eventually it will be considered and adopted this is the beauty of our system now of course the question is how long can you survive in this case in 1965 it was obvious to me that the soft underbelly of the american economy was showing great stress the reason was that back home i was getting messages from the local superintendents of the independent school district for example and other local political subdivisions as well as private corporations that even though in the case of the public entitles they had issued bonds for the construction of schools for the repair and recon struction and extension of such things as water mains and sewage mainsthat the sudden increase and the scarlcity of the material such as copper the labor costs had grown expedien tially that they first were finding it difficult to obtain the material what could we do up here because we had the strategic reserves at that time second what could be done to prevent a further escalation in the infla tionary pressures and labor well when i picked up the same local papers and looked at the want ads i saw huge ads almost half a page asking for carpenters electricians and skilled workers to address themselves to a number in san francisco for construction work in southeast asia well that was then the beginning of the great construction of the camranh bay which as you know was a many many millions of dollars investment on the part of our country and which tragically today is being used as a way stop base for the russian navy but at that time with these pressures the soft underside of our economic belly was being pressured my suggestion to the president was one of two things one immediately consider those measures that presidents such as roosevelt and truman had seen fit to devise particulary truman because in the case of president truman it was the most similar to that which we were entering into in vietnam it was an undeclared war in the case of world war ii of course which had a declaration of war and all that the means and the full resources and energies of the nation shoring up for one purpose and one purpose only and that was the prosecution and the winning of the war what they did was specific and as i keep on pointing out every year for 20 years when i ask the economists when i ask the chairman and the board menbers of the federal reserve board when you come here and tell me and you wring your hands and you say what is tantamount to saying that interest rates for example are acts of god that nobody can do anything about it you are overlooking history why is it then that world war ii where by 1945 46 percent of our gross national product was being used on the federal level governmental levelnaturally for the prosecution of the warand the government the taxpayer never had to pay more than 2 percent interest can you answer that not a one has bothered to try to answer it of course there are answers and there are reasons and this is what iwas getting at the same thing with president truman except that there they also used other leverages they had mild credit restraints at the proper time timing is the most important thing so that here we are today with the greatest enemy of all no russian menace no german menace of world war ii is or was ever as ominously dangerous as what our country has allowed to happen to itself mostly because the people have lost out because their government has foresaken the interest of the greatest number that is of the people for the sake of the predatory few who have existed through all time and also since the beginning of the history of our government now i have gone into that and i am not going to be repetitious other than to enlarge a little bit to go into the greater range of history and i should preface those remarks by giving credit to a man who is the author of the only book that i know of anywhere that has such a comprehensive history of interest rates in fact the title of his book is a history of interest rates and that man is mr sidney homer of new york his volume is not only eloquent it should be must reading i should say by certainly every member of the banking committee in his prefatory remarks he says this he says a spectacular rise in interest rates during the 1970s carried many longterm market rates on prime credits up to levels never before reached or approached in our time and remember he is writing as of 197677 at the latest and such a thing as 21 percent prime interest rate he has not experienced so we are talking about what he is calling high interest rates pushing toward 10 percent at that time a longer view i continue to quote provided by this history shows that recent peak yields were far above the highest prime longterm rates reported in the united states since 1800 or in england since 1700 or in holland since 1600 in other words since modern capital markets came into ex istence in the course of his book he has what i consider to be tbe most incisive and the most pertinent observation and sums up the issue that has motivated me to speak out and introduce resolutions and bills he says in another place and the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite the difference between law imposed and law accepted and that is what my resolution of impeachment of mr volcker is all about and my bills to abolish the board as it is now constituted and transfer all its functions its rules buildings its printing presses its clerks its mimeograph machines over to the department of the treasury where they will be accountable to the peopledirectly as it always had been and even halfway under the federal reserve act of 1913 until 1952 that is one of the bills but this is the issue it is the issue of power as i have said beforepower and the lack of accountability on that power no country in the history of the world has given the power that resides and has been used ruthlessly and without a counting by the federal reserve board and partiaularly since 1952 but generally since about 1923 and the beginning of such a gimmick as the open market committee because that power in essence is as mr volcker himself said less than 7 months ago when he was talking about the need for the policy that he has so sternly and in heedless disregard of the average little businessman of the average standard of living said yes of course some americans staidard of living is going to have to deteriorate well this is a matter of national policy under our constitutional form of government not to be determined by a financier who is beholden to the private banks that control the economic destinies of our country who is more sensitive to the needs of chase manhattan and first city national than he is to the president or the congress of the united states i said in the last couple of remarks that just here recently the president had a secret meeting with the chair man of the federal reserve board secret meeting can you imagine that as is these are two foreign potentates having a summit meeting here is a man that is supposed to be a public servant accounting if not to he congress certainly to the president finally being prevailed upon to condescend to walk over to the white house and have a secret meeting with the president we still do not know what if anything happened there has been a lot of scuttlebutt about there being an impasse and that mr volcker said you have still got to do more than what you have done thus far and i am not going to yield one bit in wrenching that screw one more time but who knows there is no accountability the chairman let it be known that he was there at sufferance not as a responsibility discharged but what is the federal reserve board the federal reserve board you would be surprised how many of my colleagues and the infinite number of constituents and citizens who have written to me that have been under the impression that the federal reserve board was independent autonomous as if it had sprung from the brow of a greek god and not created by the congress the federal reserve board is a creature of the congress born as a result of congressional action known as the federal reserve board act of 1913nothing else but in the meanwhile our system of economy predicated on mass production mass consumption the glory of the world which in turn and especially since world war ii has another third leg to that stool and that is consumer finance or mass financeis predicated on exactly the policies that are in opposition to what mr volcker says must be done because and even if it does and the price of it will be the deterioration in the standard of living of some americans what americans david rockefeller of chase manhatten hardly members of the congress hardly only insofar as we know we are impacted by some of the adverse situationsconstituents going broke the number of foreclosures on homeowners tripling in the last 6 months not postponement of payments not delinquencies but foreclosures mind you and as we watch our hapless small businessmen how can they finance a floor inventory by borrowing at a bank that is going to demand what they say 2 or 3 points over the going prime interest rate well what that means right now is that there is no small businessman who is going to get a line of credit for less or much less than 18 percent who in the world in any country at any time at any point in history with comparative situations can survive much less our form of economy this is what is at stake this is why i was impelled to follow and seek the quickest means to bring attention and focus concerted action it has not been forthcoming and perhaps it is one of those regretful cycles where we do not respond until catastrophe is on us the trouble with that is that usually when we act in emergency or crisis we do not react as wisely and as prudently as we ought as a matter of fact the federal reserve board act of 1913 was a result of the great panicmore than a depressionit was the panic of 1907 but going back even to the beginning of our government because this is tied in with the very existence of our government mr homer was not exaggerating when he said the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite that is what we have now we have the rule of the elite and that elite is a socalled elite banking class that now is supranational why should they worry when their powers transcend the capacity the ability and the jurisdiction of individual nations including our own even the matter of war and peace is a decision now pretty much vested in the bankers sc as i said earlier the issue is power are the people going to completely keep the power the constitution vests in them of formulating and approving the fiscal the monetary the economic policies that are going to govern our country or are the bankers going to do it that is the issue the bankers are doing it they have done it and 1 see nothing on the horizon that seems to be able to muster the help we need to break that hold other than disaster and that i certainly do not even want to think about though reality compels me to admit that there is much more likelihood of that than not and i have expounded on that as long ago as 2 years and 2 montis ago it seems fair to bay that the socalled free market longterm rates of interest for any industrial nation properly charted provide a sort of fever chart of the economic and political health of the nation i have been charting it and that is the reason why i was im pelled to communicate with the president in 1965 certainly i was not seeking some political or personal benefit this is a subject matter that has very little political mileage if anybody is interested in knowing that but when we look at the full range of history and we see that the rise and the fall of nations and empires and societies are tracked by this thing we call interest rates it seems that somehow we have all been brainwashed as to the true definition of interest rates interest rates is a mechania by which the wealth of any country or society is transferred it is as simple as that i have pointed out of course that interest rates can be controlled of course there is such a thing as manageability of course there is such a thing as the american form of government having the resources to do exactly that if in the wisdom of the congress and to a certain extent of the executive as well it sees fit to do so what i am saying is that there is no reason why it cannot be reversed and in order to bring about some procedural suggestions to focus our attention on the reforms needed and the actions that can be taken both legislatively and administratively i have introduced these resolutions and these bills when we look at the history as so dramatically presentedeven though this is not a book on grammar this history of interest rateswe find that we as modem citizens like to think that credit is a modern invention but we can go back to 1800 b c before christ and look at the code of hammurabi in ancient babylonand learn that there must have been agitating minds even then because in the code it is prescribed that the maximum amount of interest charged for example on grain deals was 33 percent on other transactions such as silver it was 20 percent now we come down through history we bounce down to about 600 b c the greek states and we find that the same thing agitated the athenians and the law of solon had to be invoked there was a crisis incurred because of war and debt and what not but we should remember that at that time interest could be paid in money as well as other things including per sonal enslavement for nonpayment the code of solon limited that what it did was it removed the limitations that had been in existence since the code of hammurabi but instead reduced and eliminated interest in many many ways but then the next were the romans in their socalled twelve tables of the law which were sort of semicustomary law and semistatutory prescribed law and there the romans had precise figures and limitations and they went down to the figure of 8 percent and quadruple damages for violations exess charges over that amount then we go down the line even then to what i think was the most interesting period up to now up to this entry and that was the middle ages where we had a period of a thousand years but even charlemagne in what was known as the capitularies of charlemagne flatly forbade any increment on loans for a thousand years in the middle ages that was the rule and it became a theological or a religious issue on usury and the wrongness of usury even in the time of jesus christ there were usury laws and control of interest we come down to the 12th century in england and we find there these peculiarities that we find today because this is the great dilemma of the history of interest rates rememberkia that like a fever chart as the author says we can chart a nations period of stress and downfall this is why i am so concerned about out country ar we know it was not until the confederacy actually went broke and could not obtain credit that they called the constitutional convention though when they did issue bills or notes they never paid more than 5 percent and when they borrowed they never paid more than 51 percent but it finally got to the point where because as we will recall under the confederacy or the articles of confederation the government had no power to tax that therefore its paper had no real redeeming virtue so it was at that juncture in 1786 when it could no longer get credit or issue notes that the need for calling the constitutional convention of 1787 became absolutely imperative this is how money ties in with the flow and ebb of political and govern mental events this is why i was in great distress 2 years after 1965 when i saw what was happening with gold at that time we had the socalled gold exchangenot the gold standard but the gold exchangeand the gold we were pouring into vietnam was ending up in france and later when mr nixon made his famous trip to china what we did not read in the papers was that the chinese would not let his plane land until we had deposited 10 million worth of gold with them ostensibly to secure the cost of all the tv apparatuses and the other things that were entailed in that sojourn of our president in china but the interesting thing for us to remember is that it was demanded in the form of gold that is convertible that is ultimately it is payable in gold or redeemable in gold these things all have their meaning not because there is any justification to returning to a gold standard or anything like thatthat is equal follybut because they are symptomatic of this other thing and that is the fact of the policies that are shaping for ex ample how much interest the government is paying i am sure that the founding fathers and every responsible leader through franklin roosevelt and harry truman are turning over in their graves even in the depths of the ground to hear rumors that the government is paying almost as much as 15 percent on longterm notes that is incredible a 21vpercent prime interest rate incredible and we have our president piously proclaiming on radio last saturday that oh we should not be paying more than 10 percent well why 10 percent why not 6 percent since when are we going to be so grateful that is like saying oh hit us on the head again because it feels so good when you stop it is ridiculous and it has never ceased to amaze me how with such complacency we have accepted the loss of the power of determining the policies of economics of fiscal policy and monetary policy and without a whimper and how oblivious we are to the implications of this and how much we have lost in the way of time to be able to redeem even partially what has happened there is no way that the businesses that have been forced out of business just in the last 60 days can be revived even if interest rates were to drop to 6 percent today there is no way that this economy is going to be turned around at all even if interest rates were to drop in the next 3 months to 10 percent there is no way that before the end of this year there would be any impact at all but what is tragic is that in the meanwhile we have had such a maladjustment in the functional ability of this intricate economy known as the american economy and this should have been apparent to us with the folly of the 1971 economic stabilization act wage and xirice controls and incidentally even then on that issue we were a lost voice in the wilderness as members know i am labeled a liberal and i am proud of that designation if it is interpreted like i have always interpreted it in the american sense but there were a few of us5 of us and we were alonewho resisted tlat effort in the committee and there wore about 17 in the full house and the reasons we gave of course were just about as listened to as what we have been saying here in the last few months that perhaps is neither here nor there and we return to the fundamental question and that is what should we do to have accountability at least if we cannot have the return of this usurped power why can we not have some measure of accountability from these money managers why cannot the congress act that has been my question it seems to me that it is not a question just of this board and this chairman it has been a question that has been raised since 1963 after the visit of the then secretary of the treasury mr dillon who incidentally was supposed to be a great financial wizard but actually really was not except in one category and that was knowledgeability of the bond market in new york and the speculative market there the truth is that since i have been in the congress and on this committee for 20 years i have never yet had any member of the federal reserve board much less the chairman come to the congress and give us an ac counting of the reason for policies or an explanation of the mechanism and the system used in judgment making an evaluative explanation of making judgments on these critical issues because they are the ones who are saying that if you want to buy a car you pay 16 percent interest i notice there was a lot of hulabaloo recently because a few small bankers in california decided that they could go as low as 12 percent an average american family today even with the socalled decline of inflation knows better knows that when he goes to the market or the housewife goes to that market her grocery bill is not less and the items she has to have have not been reduced i have good testimony as of last saturday from my own wife but when it comes to a car remembering that that is our prime product we like to laugh at some of our countries to the south of us as onecrop economies banana countries coffee countries sugar countries but we are pretty much the same way the automobile industry is our basic if anyone does not believe that go try to tell the quarter of a million unemployed and the ripple effect of that unemployment in the northeast in the central midwest in ohio and illinois pennsylvania new york michigan because first the cars that are made are not being sold how can the average american at 16 percent afford to even if he could get the downpayment how can the small average businessman first get a line of credit from a bank even at 16 perceit longterm mortgages 17 percent if somebody is able to find an assumable longterm mortgage april r8 1982 ironically as in the case of interest rates we are going right now in that respect in that sector of our economy we are exactly where we were in 1929 5percent balloon notes no longterm financing which is exactly the point we have reached now these are not things that are caused by accident and let me hasten to pursue one further matter they are not caused either by socalled profligate government which has not been profligate it is not caused as the economists now are expressing puzzlement the secretary of the treasury regan said about 2 weeks ago that he was completely mystified he could not understand why this intractability in the persistence of high interest rates because they were supposed to with the reduction in budgetary outlays and with the other concommitants of a reduction in inflation rates supposed to have gone down he is not the only one puzzled even some of the preeminent economists but the truth is if we do not understand the true cause and the true nature of the forbes that lead to the condition how in the world can we ever arrive at a solution to the matter it is impossible this is ekactly what i think has been the case in and out of the congress essentially we cannot have it both ways the federal reserve cannot have it both ways on the one hand they want to assume and take credit for fighting inflation through a restrictive tight money policy on the other hand they say their hands are tied because the prime cause of that inflation is the insufficient and inadequate reduction in the budgetary side of the governments activity they cannot have it both ways either they are able to and have the power or they do not on the other hand they resist any kind of inquiry from the congress fifteen years ago i requested gao to try to find out for me what resources the federal reserve board had for selfpolicing did they have an inspector general who did they account for other than a socalled internal audit the gao the general accounting office which is the only instrumentality the congress has amenable to it replied that they were not empowered to look into the federal reserve board so that i joined at that time with the distinguished chairman of the banking committee my fellow texan mr patman one of the greatest americans who has served in this house in a bill that would bring in the gao and you would have thought that we had introduced the equivalent of a resolution of an act of treason and naturally never could get it considered the bankers there is not a bill i have known of particularly those that mr patman was trying to sponsor in 1965 in anticipation of the stress in our financial and banking system that was beginning to be visible the failure of some banks and the like and so he tried to get the administration house administration committee to budget a modest amount so that he could get the staff to look into such things as interlocking directorates now of course that is out of control you have these massive mergers and acquisitions where you have more than interlocking controls you have now fewer people controlling a greater mass of our economic activity in the country mr patman was trying to get at the interlocking relationships and banks some of the monopolistic corporations some of the key pricefixing pricedetermining monopolies in our country and he never succeeded in fact he was abused and fought bitterly here and back home politically and we never succeeded in even getting approval on the committee level because i have not seen any of those bills and especially if a powerful body such as the american banking association is against any of these measures my experience and observation in 20 years is it is not about to be approved by the congress or the committee that sounds harsh but that is my observation based on 20 years of membership on the banking finance and urban affairs committee as it is now known of the house of representatives the federal reserve board is actually the private commercial banking system of the country it is not a public entity in that sense so you have the fox so to speak watching the henhouse about the only discretion we can hope he will have is how may chickens that fox decides to eat up per night and when it suddenly gets voracious and uncontrolled well then should we be pained should we be surprised if what we call the american way or standard of living is collapsing and in danger with that question i will yield with the unanimousconsent request that i may be permitted to include at this point a recent article entitled they recall cars dont they why not central bankers by an illustrious professor of economics at the university of waterloo waterloo ontario canada mr john h hotson which is very much to the point"], [0.006558597087860107, 0.9934414029121399, 1, "as we continue the debate on the various budget substitutes for fiscal year 1983 i would like to offer some comments for my colleagues to seriously consider regarding these budget proposals specifically i stand in opposition to the latta substitute this budget substitute will have a profound adverse effect upon the nation in general and the poor and minorities of this nation in particular it is most disquieting and troubling to me that the present administration as well as my fellow colleagues in the congress are continuing to recommend cuts in programs which adversely affect the poor of this nation at a time when approximately 50 million people are reeling from the debilitating consequences of inflation and unemployment this budget proposal has every indication of consigning this group to a position of permanent underclass in our nation it has become clear to me that the current administration had declared an all out war on our nations poor and middle class the hopeful and compassionate sociocconomic programs that were generated in the 1930s and 1960 s have been scuttled by these budget proposals a determination has been made to support defense needs as a priority rather than human needs as reflected in the disparate conditions of the nations average citizen the litany of sorrows and national frustrations already engulf the urban centers and rural areas of our nation added to these frustrations budget proposals continue to include cuts which fall most heavily on aid to families with dependent children supplemental security income food stamps child nutrition programs energy aid to the poor and support programs for the elderly the misery index has swe d beyond all conceivable dimensions how many americans feel that they are better off now than they were just 2 years ago it was just 2 years ago when this question was asked by our current president then candidate reagan i suggest that we ask the same question to the over 10 million unemployed i suggest to you now that we ask the same question to the family farmers who are bankrupt i suggest that we ask the same question to the factory workers the steelworkers the autoworkers the government workers educators senior citizens consumers construction workers transportation workers i suggest that we ask the white collar the blue collar hne nocollar working poor that same question i suggest that we ask ourselves what the answer would be i put this question to my colleagues in this chamber is our country better off today than it was yesterday if you examine your conscience and your heart you and i both realize that the answer is no the strategy of the current adininistration is to combat inflation at the expense of jobs by deliberately creating unemployment there are currently 10 3 million americans out of work not since june of 1941 when the united states was still suffering from the effects of the great depression has the nation experienced an unemployment level as high as the level for april 1982 reported by the labor department i find the latta budget proposal to be totally unacceptable and incompatible with the american ideal of equality of opportunity for all i have some specific examples to share with this body regarding the impact of past budget cuts on federal employees of our nation as well as the impact on postal employees and services since january 1981 8 914 federal employees have been separated from their jobs with another 18 000 federal workers displaced by rif procedures thousands of federal employees have been unilaterally furloughed without pay for 1 day per pay period resulting in nothing less than a 10 percent reduction in salary for those federal employees nor have federal retirees escaped the budet knife the reconciliation bill passeu by congress last july reduced their semiannual costofliving adjustments to just 1 per year in light of the above federal workers are wondering whether the administrations goal is austerity or extinction the president wants to eliminate totally the public service subsidy which supports uneconomica postal activities such as doortodoor service 6day delivery rural mail service and so forth last year congress reduced this subsidy by 452 million to 100 million for fiscal yenr 1983 now the administration would erase this subsidy entirely for fiscal year 1983 further significant reductions of this subsidy will inevitably contribute to deterioration of the quality of postal services and will significantly contribute to further postal rate increases the idea of a selfsupporting postal service is illadvised and unrealistic the idea of a postal service whose revenue will equal its operating expenses is simply incompatible with a postal service which provides efficient service at uniform economical rates to all citizens of this nation the postal service cannot be treated as if it were a private business to maintain a quality of service which americans need and rightfully expect to stem the increase of postal rates the postal service needs an infusion of funds provided by the public service subsidy the other category of postal appropriations which the administration wishes to cut dramatically is the revenue foregone appropriationthe direct aubsidy of the rates paid by certain categories of mailers the administration last year succeeded in cutting this subsidy to the point that rates paid by mailers have risen by anywhere from 50 to 110 percent and now the subsidy would be cut even more for fiscal year 1983 if this happens the rates will go still higher it is ironic that the same administration that is urging private charities to pick up the slack caused by cuts in social programs is now depriving these organizations of the wherewithal to do the job the situation is bad and getting worse and i say to you that the proposed latta substitute whil compound the problems we face this fierce attack directed against the needy is continuing in full force in this chamber this group is reeling from a national administrktion that has terminated the witr on poverty and declared war against the poor i believe it to be fitting and appropriate at this time to refer to hubert h humphrey a warrior for justice who during the dedication of the hubert h humphrey building in 1977 said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of lifethe children those who are in the twilight of lifethe aged and those in the shadows of lifethe sick the needy and the handicapped the latta substitute before this body shows only insensitivity toward the plight of these groups the assault continues on the children the old the sick and the handicapped and this is evidence enough that we are failing the moral test of government in april 1886 frederick douglass stated where justice is denied where poverty is enforced where ignorance prevails arid where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress ii 3094 rob and degrade them neither persons nor property will be safe this was written almost 100 years ago however the message conveyed still speaks loud and clear in relation to the increased military buildup at the expense of badly needed moneys for socioeconomic programs the philosophy the mind set the mentality of the administration and a majority of the members of this body are ones of a determination to misdirect our resources toward a massive war machine the fauntroy substitute was not about race for the effects of the substitute transcended race in our society suffering pain and deprivation cannot be equated with race swollen bellies in all white rural nebraska are just as debilitating as they are in all black harlem illiteracy in all white eastern kentucky and mental retardation in all white joplin mo are just as crippling as they are in mostly hispanic san jose suffering is a human condition which transcends consideration of race and color the latta substitute specifically with regare to social programs as well as in the a eas of general government is callous nd appalling this budget will eliminute resources which provide food shelter clothing jobs and health care to many of the poor

economic and budget plans was called to fill a gaping hole in public debate there has been remarkably little critical examination and discussion of the administrations prpposals the underlying assumptions the desirability of the proposed shift to freemarket solutions for problems ranging from energy conservation and funding for the arts to distressed industries and cities and of the human and social impact of the changes being considered if we have learned anything about economics during the past decade it is that no single group least of all professional economists have a lock on the truth yet we face today a very determined band of conservative economists and policymakers in the white housesome might call them economic theologians who trade in belief rather than proofwho are asking congress to ratify sweeping changes in federal policy without offering in return the harc economic and impact analysis that is needed to consider their proposals the reagan administrations game plan represents far more than just a series of piecemeal budget cuts it signifies a major reordering of federal priorities roles and responsibilities built up over the last three decades as one example the president proposes to consolidate health education and social service programs into a few block grants while cutting aggregate funds in each area by about onequarter under this plan states and localities will have complete discretion to decide which program will receive funds and for what in the education field it could mean that the claims of a disadvantaged child for funds will be set against the claims of adult or vocational education or even library support without federal standards political weight can prove decisive in the fight over block grant funds is this the concept congross had in the historic battle against poverty and unequal opportunity the reagan proposals also contain the seeds of a fundamental shift in the composition of federal revenues already during the past few decades the corporate share of the federal tax burden has declined dramatically while individual taxes have risen now under the reagan proposal to cut business taxes through accelerated do preciation business taxes could be cut by more than half of what they are presently yet there are no contemplated cuts in payroll taxes on individuals that in many cases already exceed the burden of income taxes it should be clear by now that the administrations intention to cut taxes by 30 percent will impose on congress the deepening burden to make even further domestic program cuts in future years as the individual tax load grows ever more intolerable in the last several days i have talked to a number of economists who have raised serious questions about the absence of hard economic analysis the reliability of the administrations projections the defensibility of its assumptions about how individuals and firms behave and the chances that the new plan will seriously address inflation and stagnation chairman fernand st gerimain of the banking committee commented last week about the reqgan plan i am fearful that this endless string of numbers from omb is the product of a computer gone wild bent on reaching some preconceived idea of a multibilliondollar total without concern about needs or efficiencies he put his finger on a basic aspect of the approach it is long on rhetoric and symbols that appeal to public discontents and short on economic and impact analysis yet in the face of profound changes in federal policyiii the very definition of what the federal government means to peoplewe are being asked to put out questions and doubts aside and just have faith in the judgment of the orchestrators one of the leaders of the neoconservative movement that spawned the reagan program irving kristol writing in the wall street journal recently observed the interactions are so subtle the feedbacks so complex that we do not have any econometric model capable of handling them translated into laymans language mr kristol is telling us that nobody in the administration really knows what the effects of its plans will be it almost appears as if we are

apparently are unlimited there are all types of tax breaks that should now be reexamined mostly benefiting upperincome groups and corporations without having any discernible broad public value yet

chickens pigs cattle and buffalo secretary of state haigs announcement in berlin this week that the unitedstates government has conclusively identified the agents used by communist forces in indochina demands immediate international attention the perversion of science involved in the development and exploitation of chemical weapons is one of the tragedies of the 20th century first used by the germans at ypres belgium in 1914 poison gas caused an estimated 1 3 million casualties during world war i until recently few instances of the further use in combat of lethal chemical agents have been documented chemical weapons were employed sporadically by mussolinis troops against ethiopia in 1935 by the japanese in china and taiwan in the late thirties and by the egyptians in yemen during the midsixties unconfirmed reports also exist that chemical weapons may briefly have been employed by the ethiopians against eritrean rebels and that the vietnamese may have warned the chinese of their chemical weapon capacities by controlled usage of poison gases during chinas border incursion in january 1979 in addition afghan freedom fighters mujahadin have reported to me the use of poisonous zaerdar bullets and sleeping sticks by soviet troops in their efforts to subjugate an unwilling population the former cause severe fever and death from even the most minor wound and the latter dropped from planes and helicopters cause everyone in the vicinityto fall into a deep sleep rendering them vulnerable to capture and likely death in this conflict where few prisoners are taken the use of poison bullets and sleepinducing gas represents yet another dramatic escalation in the chemical weapons race the effects of chemical warfare have a tendency to be exaggerated by those who have witnessed its use and paradoxically to be ignored by civilized people who have difficulty facing up to uncivilized behavior but it is clear that there is an ominous trend toward legitimization as well as proliferation of chemical weapons usage reports in fact are beginning to surface of chemical weapons preparation being made by both sides in the iranianiraqi conflict and of recent purchases of chemical weapons by countries as disparate as syria libya and india and of direct strategic importance to the united states the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies have substantial stockpiles as do north korea and to a lesser extent cuba the soviet union possesses the worlds largest stockpile of chemical weapons and russian military doctrine emphasized chemical warfare as part of a triad of weapons of mass destruction however unlike the other two arms of the triadbiological and nuclearchemical weapons are considered conventional in the sense that their usage implies a lower threshold strategic option it is estimated that soviet forces include 90 000 officers and men trained extensively in chemical weaponry while by contrast the united states has perhaps 2 000and a military doctrine reflecting a substantially lower tolerance for chemical weapons usage human evidence of the use of chemical weapons in southeast asia and afghanistan has been readily available but definitive analysis of the precise substances involved has been lacking in this international detective story bodies have been uncovered but until now the exact weapon has remained a mystery until now also most governments of the world including our own have given surprisingly little attention to this extraordinary aspect of mans inhumanity to man having heard rumors in the refugee community of the possible employment of chemical weapons in laos i visited nong khai a refugee camp in northern thailand in january 1979 after personally interviewing hmong tribespeople who witnessed chemical weapons attacks i became convinced of the validity of refugee claims and requested that the state department launch a thorough investigation of the problem and raise the chemical weapons issue as a high priority iterr in appropriate international bodies unfortunately the carter administration displayed surprising reluctance to investigate systematically the ref ugee reports and to apply appropriate historical perspective to the issue itself it iuoed publicly to confirm that ch~emacial weapons were indeed being used by the vietnamese and laotian communist forces despite the overwhelming refugee evidence and the corroboratory intelligence information available at the time while collection of evidence proceeded though frequently on a happenstantial basis the state department took the position that the unitedstates government had no responsibility under international law to determine the validity of the allegations concerning chemical weapons usage while legalistically correct this position could not have been more morally derelict if civilized countries refuse to ackriowledge the evidence and marshal world public opinion against the usage of such weapons the legal moral and political sanctions against their use in the future could not help but be weakened the reluctance of our govcrnment to confirm the irrefutable was reminiscent of the refusal of westerni democratic governments in the late thirties and early forties to accept the startling body of evidence that pointed to nazi concentration camp gassing of europes jewish population in an effort to increase governmental concern for the issue i introduced and congress eventually passed legislation to compel the administration to launch broad governmental and diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing world attention to the issue of poison gas usage in southeast asia and to intensify efforts to conclude an international convention prohibiting the development production and stockpiling of chemical weapons unfortunately despite the establishment of a u n investigatory group little international headway has to date been made sample after sample of chemical evidence was provided the international red cross and our intelligence agencies and one even in an exchange to the defense department through my office but sparse resources and slipshod attention was given by our government to the analysis process this june i wrote secretary of defense caspar weinberger a letter outlining the shortcomings of our collection and laboratory analysis efforts with recommendations for change perhaps because of this prodding perhaps b~cause of the urging of an energetic scholar sterling seagrave who has committed substantial personnal resources to investigating the issue the defense department finally decided to dedicate greater resources to the scientific dimension of the probe and turned over to a sophisticated private laboratory samples of chemical residues from kampuchea the laboratory results proved definitive three blood blister and vomiting trichothecene toxin were identified the effects of which on human beings are so revolting that they defy reasonable description the surprise aspect of the laboratory discovery and the clear reason government scientists have been stumped so long in their efforts to identify the agents involved is that the chemical residues remaining on the leaf and stem samples examined did not have the composition of traditional chemical weapons instead the agents have been identified as biologically derived mycotoxins with secretary haigs speech in berlin the unitedstates government for the first time affirmed that chemical weapons have been employed in indochina the smoking gun the secretary indicated has been foundwith fingerprints despite the reluctance of the state department to point a direct finger at the soviet union there is no room for question as to whose fingerprints they are while it is nearly impossible to track the actual transfer of chemical weapons from soviet stockpiles to vietnamese combatants the toxins identified to have been used in southeast asia do not occur there naturally neither the vietnamese nor other forces under their influence have the capacity to produce them on the scale that has been witnessed in addition massive evidence exists of soviet support to and monitoring of chemical attacks in indochina but this evidence is unfortunately still classified without doubt the soviet union stands in direct violation of both the geneva protocol of 1925 and the 1972 biological weapons convention which as a junior foreign service officer i helped draft and negotiate in geneva the geneva protocol prohibits the use in war of chemical and biological weapons the biological wyeapons convention prohibits the manufacture or retention for nonpeaceful purposes of biological and toxin weapons as well as their transfer to any other party unfortunately neither the geneva protocol nor the biological weapons convention contain provisions for onsite verification or appropriate international sanction in the event violations are discovered they are treaties which hay 3 been helpful in reducing the usage of these terrible instruments of war but their weaknesses are grave the use by communist forces of exotic mycotoxins which dissipate into the air within hours of dissemination marks the commission of a nearperfect crime it has taken years of ef fort to collect the evidence concerning the laboratorylike experiments the soviets have cynically conducted on some of the poorest and most defenseless people in the world the use of chemical weapons by sovietsupported forces has profound racial as well as strategic implications new modes of weaponry are being battle tested in remote and poverty stricken areas of the globe with tribal and ethic minorities serving as guinea pigs the communist call for national liberation has come to mean national genocide for afghan freedom fighters and tribal groups like the hmong of laos unfortunately even though third world peoples are the current victims of chemical weapons there does not appear to be great alarm in the third world concerning their use partly because soviet brutality has come to be perceived as a norm partly because american credibility has been undercut by a foreign policy that appears insensitive to the concerns of developing countries this problem has been exacerbated in recent months by the administrations stand on a number of issues our opposition to the infant formula marketing code and the law of the sea treaty our faiure to join in the condemnation of south africa in the u n and our military involvement in el salvador are seen by many developing countries as examples of poor judgment and callous insensitivity in addition our involvement in vietnam and introduction of virulent herbicides like agent orange to that conflict has undercut significantly our international stature on the chemical weapons issue in the postworld war ii era the united states played the dominant role in the u n and most other international bodies not only did we never veto a security council measure but for 20 years we never voted on the losing side of a u n resolution in recent years however we are becoming increasingly isolated as we support the interests of pariah states like south africa and narrow corporate interests as in the infant formula and law of the sea negotiations developing nations perceive the united states rightly or wrongly as projecting a poiicy of almost exclusive paranoia against the soviet union with no complementary concern for the comipassionate needs of the lessadvantaged people of the world thus when secretary haig points with care at a towvering international grievance his commenits do not carry the moral force they deserve in strategic terms the renewed use ef biochemical weapons underlines the possibility that without new international sanctions another enormously expensive and awesomely dangerous arms race may be in the making faced with evidence that the soviets have not only a capability but also a willingness to use mycotoxin weapons the united states has only two realistic options national security requires that wve either upgrade significantly our owvn chemical arsenal or launch negotiations aimed at definitively eliminating biochemical instruments of warfare given the training and technological advantage currently enjoyed by the soviets strategic as well as humanitarian considerations make arms control from the unitedstates perspective vastly preferable to a costly new arms race that in the long run no one can win if legitimized through production stockpiling and use chemical and mycotoxin weapons could all too easily become the poor mans weapon of mass destruction nuclear arms are beyond the financial and technical capacities of most nations and bacteriological warfare is generally regarded as too dangerous and uncontrollable howev ~ countries which are unable or unwilling to produce nuclear and bacteriological weapons can easily produce or obtain some types of deadly chemicals if the soviet union and its surrogates get away with using chemical weapons with impunity the list of other countries willing and able to do likewise will almost certainly grow in this hemisphere for example the training of castros army in chemical wveapons techniques and the glib comment attributed to castro that he has the capacity to spread hoof and mouth disease in the united states does not bode well for future hemispheric relations there is no indication cuba has anything but a very modest stockpile of chemical weapons but the fact that castro himself has referenced cubas biochemical capacities and alleged unitedstates use against cuba of such weapons is worthy of careful attention it can sometimes be a mistake not to take a communist leader at his word in the final analysis from the soviet unions perspective there is real question whether the proliferation of chemical agents may not carry more longterm liabilities than advantages as long as the soviet untan is on the side of the forces which exclusively have chemical weapons at their command the advantages are obvious but if smaller countries and insurgency groups unsympathetic to soviet interests obtain these weapons overwhelming soviet military power may be offset in the event of a nationalist rebellion in eastern europe for instance antisoviet forces possessing chemical weapons could provide a devastating disincentive to soviet intervention now that the flagrant violation of international law by the soviet union has been incontrovertibly exposed the opportunity exists to test the muchdiscussed concept of linkage a symbolic and meaningful wvay of reorienting the direction of arms control talks might well be to bring the issue of chemical weapons to the salt negotiating table such linkage would bring soviet third world adventurism to the forefront and serve as well to broaden arms control concerns away from the united states and soviet preoccupation with bilateral nuclear discussions a chemical weapons initiative of this nature might help break the deadlock in current arms control discussions the soviets face a choice that might be summed up as pox or pax if they are not prepared to be forthcoming in negotiating a verifiable ban on chemical weapons they can have little expectation of meaningful progress in other arms control areas president reagan for his part may not be as quick to endorse certain arms control positions as his predecessor but he probably has the leadership to get any treaty that he might sanction ratified a reluctant reagan has the potential to be a more effective arms controller

in that office charged with carrying out the moral purposes of unitedstates foreign policy while we will not always agree with him we must also say that he is light years ahead in his understanding of human rights than was ernest lefevre or most of the people considered for this office i think it is therefore appropriate that we lay out an agenda for mr abrams i have such an agenda it has nine points but first i think we should reflect back on the history of the human rights movement when the world was largerwhen transportation and communication were much slowerwe did not pay that much attention to what happened to other people in other parts of the globe so an old legal tradition grew up the individual was not an apt subject of international law what a nation did with its own individual citizens was its own business an internal affair it was of no legitimate concern to other nations but as so often happens time gives way to events w~hen we say one of the most advanced countries in the world descend into barbarismand saw the resultant holocaustour ideas changed out of the ashes of that holocaust we decidedin the u n declaration of human rights in 1948that the concept that the individual wvas not an apt subject for international lawwas an old concept which we could no longerf harbor we recognized that when a government of a country persecutes tortures and puts to death its own citizens the citizens of that country have to turn for help outside their own border but the declaration on human rights was just thata declaration it had no binding effect to put this nonbinding declaration into effect the united nations decided they would provide threeconvenants the covenant on the prevention and punishment of the crimei of genocide the covenant on political and civil rights the covenants in social culturaland economic rights by 1949 the genocide convention became part of theu n treaty it was not however taken up by the unitedstates senate until 1974 and it was defeated twice by filibuster the other covenants which were completed in 1966 were not sent to the senate until 1978 by president carter they are still languishing in the senate so here we are the united states says we are in favor of hiuman rights yet we are unwilling to bind ourselves in treaty form with other countries to see that even the most basic humnan rights are observed wherever i go in the world and talk with government leaders about human rights they always bring that up to me nonetheless the declaration and those three covenants represent real progressan affirmation that what happens in other countries at the hands of the government is a legitimate concern and a cause for action by other governments of the world in 1975 we took another step i in troduced legislationnow know as the harkin amendmentwhich prohibits economic aid to governments engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of the basic human rights of their citizens that is section 116 of the foreign assistance act it was the first time weas a nationwere willing to put our concern for human rights into operative law and we did it with the support of the democratic congress which approved it and the republican president who signed it since then it has been renewed and extended similar language now covers military aid and sales the way unitedstates votes in the multilateral development banks and the dispensing of opic insurance and public law 480 food for peace loans when jimmy carter took office he embraced human rights as his own human rights had a shaky start in the carter administration there was great bureaucratic resistance the policy was often faltering and inconsistent the carter administration stood silent as tens if not hund reds of thousands of people were kiled by the indonesian army in east timor but the policy was gradually implemented human rights concernsthe plight of political prisoners torture disappearances killingsbecame regular subjects for bilateral discussion between the united states and foreign governments the racial war in rhodesia was resolved and the new nation of zimbawe emerged nigeria peru ecuador and the dominican republic all moved to democracy and greater respect for human rights but now i must speak candidly the last year has not been a happy or even satisfactory one for the human rights mnovement the people of poland have succeeded against enormous odds in achieving greater freedom their achievement is heartening to us all however statesponsored terrorism in central america has escalated the soviet union has continued its fierce campaign against dissidents including the courageous andre sakharov repression has worsened dramatically in south korea in washington the administration has given occasional lipservice to human rights but no real support the newv administrations efforts to distance itself from the policies of its predecessor have been clumsy abrasive and callous the reagan administration has often denounced the carter adninistrations human rights policy as too loud too public too harsh on some and too lenient on others but we know that most of the time the carter administration relied on the quiet diplomnacy that the reagan administration purports to practice human rights concerns were conveyed through private diplomatic channels these messages carried with them the implicit threat of public criticism or reduction in assistance as a spur to action as a rule countries were given ample opportunity to redress human rights violations quietly and without embarassment we all acknowledge the carter policy has flaws but in comparison with what we have seen in the past 11 months it is a model of sobriety and effectiveness since january 20 the new administration has launched a fullscale attack on the policy of human rights the new administration signaled its intentions very early by nominating ekiiest lefevre as assistant secretary of state for human rights this man had opposed the carter administration step by step in its successful resolution of the conflictin zimbabwe and worse he had called for the repeal of all human rights law on the premise that the internal affairs of other countries were no concern of the united states the senate foreign relations committee to its credit soundly defeated that nomination but in the mean timesecretary haig announced that internationall terrorism had replaced human rights as the principal concern for unitedstates foreign policy despite section 502b of the foreign assistance act which lays out a clear relationship between the observance of human rights and a governments eligibility to receive unitedstates arms under secretary of state for security assistance james buckley announced new guidelines to govern foreign military sales not one of which was human rights the reagan administration has replaced quet diplomacy with acquiescent diplomacy vice president bush gushes about the democratic character of the dictatorial government of thephilippines assistant secretary of state enders touts el salvadorwhose brutal military commanders are completely beyond controlas a progressive centrist republic u n ambassador kirkpatrick defers to the argendecem ber 10 1981 tine government and refuses to meet with he mothers of the plaza del kayo or any other human rights groups in south america two days after ambassador kirkpatrick visited chile in august and publically embraced the pinochet government four opposition leaders including the head of the chilean human rights commission were expelled from the country since then the administration has signaled the chilean government that if congress lifts the arms embargo it will resume a military relationship with that very repressive government secretary of state haig continualy escalates his rhetoric to new levels of cold war sloganeering secretary haig muses to the press on almost a daily basis about blockading destabilizing or invading nicaragua he ignores the evident fact that while the leaders of nioaraguab peaceful opposition face increasing restrictions even imprisonment the leaders of el salvadors and guatemalas peaceful oppositions are in exile or dead either way the victims of governmentcondoned death squads and yet today nicaragua receives the bullying the salvadorani receive the guns this is not quiet diplomacy this is not evenhanded policy moderates within the nicaraguan government have told me personally that the reaganhaig rhetoric has one effect it is undermining their position and aiding the most hardline and repressive faction in the government helping democratic forces in nicaragua or anywhere else in central america is obviously not a priority for the administration the conclusion is harsh but the facts allow no other the priority instead is for the united states to dominate the united states nded not cannot and should not dominate central america the people of that region are capable of governing their own lives and futures franklin roosevelt articulated this premise 37 years ago when he spoke of the four freedoms one of which was the freedom from fear the guiding principle for achieving freedom from fear for promoting human rights should be this those leaders who do murder torture or arbitrarily imprison their opponents should not receive unitedstates assistance mankind has not dropped down to three freedoms just because 51 percent of the american voters preferred mr reagan in the last election the freedom from fearthe respect for the physical integrity of each personwill always stand as the basis for all human rights the fundamental ideal that brings us together here to observe this special day i think we should welcome elliott abrams to his new job he seems to be a man of intelligence and good faith and we wish him well he can if he chooses help end the hypocrisy and callousness that has characterized the administrations nonpolicy on human rights i in the spirit of constructive criticism and cooperation i would like to take this opportunity to present a ninepoint agenda for human rights action it is an agenda of practical principles specific proposals for policy accompany each principle none of the points clash with mr abrams statements on human rights all of the points would help to advance american interests to ease suffering and to save lives my proposed agenda has three sections the first concerns human rights laws the second human rights diplomacy the third human rights symbolism most important is the law simply put mr abrams should make certain that the administration obeys the laws of the unitedstates congress which has passed several general human rights laws in recent years this legislation denies foreign assistance to governments guilty of a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights here is the agenda i point 1 respect the law prohibiting arms whether sold or given to governments with miserable human rights records to cite only the most blatant case mr abrams should urge the secretary of state to immediately reject the guatemalan military regimes pending request for helicopter and airplane parts the guatemalan military has become the khmer rouge of the western hemisphere it is a small clique of ruthless men willing to cause any level of suffering and death among innocent people in order to preserve their own grip on power the americanimade helicopter and attack planes the military wants to put into action will not counter any external threat you and i know that they will instead be used to kill peasants and indians in remote areas who protest against army massacres and land seizures mr abrams knows this too and should make every effort to see that the spare parts are not sold point 2 if aid to a human rights violator is considered absolutely necessary inform the congress of the extraordinary circumstances which justify it mr abrams ought to prepare such an explanation for the sale of fighter jets and the provision of economic aid to pakistan that country remains under martial law general zia has jailed key political leaders and has effectively handcuffed the nations judicial system such an explanation would make it clear to general zia that the united states demands human rights improvements as a condition for future aid point 3 do not sell prescribed crime control equipment to the internal security forces of governments that routinely violate human rights tho law forbids such sales nevertheless the united states recently sold 1 million worth of communications equipment to the internal security forces of syria one of the worst violators of human rights in the middle east mr abrams should block any future sales to syria until that government changes its repressive ways and opens up its prisons to the red cross point 4 vote against world bank and other multilateral development bank loans to gross and consistentvolators of human rights the law requires a vote of no or an abstention mr abrams should insist that unitedstates delegates to the interamerican development bank vote no or abstain on future votes regarding loans to chile amnesty international and other groups have documented increasing torture and arbitrary arrests in chile more than 1 200 disappeared persons remain unaccounted for at the same time that the unitedstates abstains on such votes mr abrams ought to notify the chileans privately of specific human rights cases that concern the united states this will demonstrate the unitedstates commitment to human rights without creating a public confrontation this should also be done on votes to uruguay paraguay argentina south korea and the philippines point 5 bar the overseas private investment corporation from providing loan guarantees for business projects in countries with poor human rights records this point is written into the corporations charter since the adoption of the human rights amendment in 1978 the executive branch has not obeyed the law it has only denied those applications for opic insurance or loans for projects in which the host government directly participates at the very minimum i believe the carter administration violated the law in the case of 20 different projects in 1978 and 1979 projects were approved for the countries of el salvador indonesia the philippines haiti and pakistan i urge elliott abrams in the strongest terms to review the law its legislative history and past practices this is an easy place for the reagan administration to show a greater commitment to human rights and observance of the human rights laws let me tell you what can happen if we are not careful recently texaco oil co applied for a multimilliondollar opic loan guarantee for an energy project in guatemala think about it texaco is a corporation that made 1 8 billion in profit in the first 9 months of this year like the reagan administration they are big supporters of free enterprise yet they applied for a unitedstates government guaranteefor a project that would benefit only them and the repressive government of guatemala suich a guarantee would have violated human rights law it would have defied a congressional resolution that opic not assist big oil companies and it would have flown in the face of the administrations professed belief in free enterprise welllam happy to reporttexaco withdrew its loan application but we and mr abrams must be vigilant texaco and the other big oil companies and conglomerates will be back with their plans to aid repressive regimes and destabilize governments that they do not like effective unitedstates foreign policy is not solely restricted to complying with the various human rights laws the united states can also effectively act to improve the human rights situation through ordinary diplomatic channels point 6 link trade concessions with the human rights situation today jewish emigration from romania is at a 10year low before romania is granted most favored nation status mr abrams should establish an agreement for a reasonable figure on jewish emigration point 7 take unilateral diplomatic action tc demonstrate our willingness to promote human rights throughout the world even in countries where we lack influence with few ties to ethiopia a revolutionary country in the soviet orbit we have little leverage to ease that governments repressive ways but the united states can help we can aid the falasha ethiopias black jews who face particularly harsh suppression mr abrams can urge the creation of a special preferential status under the refugee act that would enable the falasha to enter the united states finally the area of symbolic action these are moves that underscore reiterate and dramatize the depth of the american belief that human rights are a prerequisite to a just and safe world they cannot substitute for obeying the human rights laws or for taking forceful diplomatic action they complement not replace substantive human rights action point 8 use the united nations and other international bodies to gain the support of allies for the unitedstates human rights position mr abrams ought to lobby the administration to support th u n trust fund the fund sponsors education and training for black south africans it is a modest program calling for only 400 000 in unitedstates expenditures the inclusion and increase of tht funding in the current foreign aid bill would prove the unitedstates support for the human rights aspiration of south africas black majority point 9 ask american embassy personnel to meet with human rights advocates opposition leaders clergy and ordinary citizens involved in human rights cases these meetings need not be publicized for them to deliver a quiet powerful message to all concerned in the case of argentina mr abrams should end the kirkpatrick policy of disdaining the argentine human rights movement we should have regular contact with the mothers of the plaza del mayo they and other groups can help the united states gather information for the annual state department human rights reports and help the united states show its hope for the restoration of democracy embassy officials might also meet with bishop tutu and other representatives of the church in soith africa this is a modest agenda a starting point a set of recommendations to point mr abrams in the right direction the reagan administration seems to have forgotten that it is people who make government it has forgotten that unitedstates economic and military support for murder and torture discredits quiet unitedstates support for democracy and justice it has forgotten that government by force can only succeed for so long and that when force yields to popular pressure the people do not forget who has befriended them for such a case of amnesia there is only one cure the constant reminders of the american people and their representatives in congress when the founders of our country declared that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights they voiced the conviction that has inspired and united americans ever sincethe conviction that human beings everywhere are born with certain rights and that no government can justifiably deny these rights mr abrams and the reagan administration would do well to reaffirm their commitment to this simple but eloquent premlse"], [0.00801759958267212, 0.9919824004173279, 1, "the president is now discovering what can happen when budgets are blindly slashed

discussion of arms control and the nuclear arms race there have been many many warnings over the years about the danger posed by nuclear weapons to civilization and the futility of any war fought with nuclear weapons every president from eisenhower to carter has tried to remind us that there couild be no such thing as victory in a war fought with such weapons twenty years ago president kennedy told our nation and the world thatevery man woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness the weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us yet when we look back over all these years the competition between the united states and the soviet union in the development of nuclear weaponry has proceeded steadily relentlessly without the faintest regard for the future of the human race both the united states and the soviet union have gone about the business of piling weapons upon weapons missiles upon missiles new levels of destructiveness upon old ones today it is es timated that the united states the soviet union and the other nuclear weapons states possess more than 50 000 nuclear warheads the vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying instead of enriching human life it was president eisenhower who said every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under a cloud of war it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron the further development of nuclear weaponry hastens the day when civilization moves closer to the eve of destruction the world however was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution we must prevent the nuclear arms race from mushrooming out of control there is a new and strong wind of public opinion in support of a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium now crossing over our land it was felt in the numerous town meetings in new england it is gathering momentum in various state legislatures such as in wisconsin it is spreading out to callfornia where the public will vote on a referendum endorsing a mutual nuclear arms moratorium this wind will sweep back to washington where we in the congress will have the opportunity to put the congress on record as favoring negotiations for a mutual freeze and verifiable nuclear arms reduction as proposed by house joint resolution 434 i recently received several letters from high school

soviet chief of staff and supreme ranking soldier warned kremlin leaders in a recent book to respond to the reagan administrations active preparations for a nuclear war by putting the country on a war footing ogarkov recommends the coordination of mobilization and deployment of the armed forces and the entire economy and particularly the use of human resources transport communications and energy to secure the stability and livability of the country the marshal continues the fast pace of the development of nuclear missile weaponry by the adversary and the possibility of their sudden use call for new steps to secure the vital interests of our people t he failure to change views in time stagnation in the development and implementation of new questions of military construction are fraught with serious consequences president brezhnevs announcement of a eur6missiles moratorium on march 16 must be viewed in light of this pressure on the kremlin to respond to american military posture in kind while president reagan and other administration officials have belittled mr brezhnevs unilateral action i perceive in it an element of desperation perhaps even more important american citizens are becoming increasingly desperate and frustrated with governmental inability to limit the production deployment and proliferation of nuclear weapons recent polls reflect the rise in citizen concern a gallup poll of last december revealed that 75 percent of americans would like to see the united states and the unitedstatess r reduce their stock of nuclear weapons by 50 percent the washington post abc news poll released last week indicated that 45 percent of americans believe the chance of nuclear war has increascd during the reagan presidency while 46 percent think reagan has not done as much as he should to limit the buildup of nuclear weapons drawing on the history of the civil rights movement and the vietnam era americans are beginning to recognize that grassroots organization and citizen activism may be the only vehicle through which to achieve progress in limiting the arms race it is crucial that we now seize on brezhnevs initiative and make credible proposals to the soviets the prospects for a nuclear arms freeze are promising while the conequences of failure to achieve a freeze are devastating the emergence of a broadbased constituency in favor of a freeze and disarmament will help to secure senate confirmation of an armscontrol agreement the absence of such a constituency was partially responsible for the failure of salt ii in addition to passing a

for the waiver in this rule a point of order could be made against the ftc appropriation now it is not the fault of the appropriations committee i want to make that very clear it is not the fault of

this problem and if you remember i suggest to my colleagues several years ago because of the same type of situation we are in today the exact same type of situation the ftc was not authorized and ultimately did not get funds appropriated because of this same type of fight what we areseeing here is a minority of the members of the house attempting to impose their will through the use of the

constituency in this matter i think the gentleman from colorado has raised an important issue i would like to in that context make a few observations some of which have already been alluded to i would only make them to underscore for the purposes of emphasis first the rationale for the development of this training site is to improve combat readiness and in specific the 4th mechanized division at fort carson i question the wisdom of an action that would develop a new training site speaking to the need for combat readiness that would not be constructed for 5 years i question the wisdom of the definition of the readiness when it takes 5 years for us to prepare for it second the author of the amendment has thoughtfully proposed a number of alternatives that are available to the 4th mechanized division fort irwin and fort bliss i have talked with the chairperson of the subcommittee on military construction of the committee on appropriations who indicated that this sunday he and members of the subcommittee will be visiting this site to determine whether this is the only available alternative to increase the readiness of the 4th mechanized division i would suggest that it is wise to at least provide the opportunity for these people to carry out their study to determine whether or not the acquisition of 244 000 acres is the most efficient effective wise way of providing combat readiness fourth i might indicate that my distinguished colleague the gentleman from colorado in his remarks in the general debate raised a number of significant and important environmental impact issues it would seem to me they have been vaguely glossed over during the course of these deliberations to summarize in my estimation this proposal may not be the most costeffective way to accomplish the goal of combat readiness with a 5year delay i would question the wisdom of this action and the definition of readiness if it takes 5 years to achieve it finally it would seem to me that given the fact that there are members of this body specifically members of the committee on appropriations subcommittee who would have to fund this project who are prepared to diligently pursue the feasibility of alternatives that it would behoove us to strike this matter from the authorization until such time as all of the alternatives have been carefully studied and placed before us so i would

grain exports to the unitedstatess r imposed in 1980 the new farm bill contains provisions that virtually guarantee that such an embargo can never happen again having such provisions in the law is vitally important at this time of great unrest in poland and eastern europe second the 1949 act contains none of the provisions of public law 480the foodforpeace program and public law 480 has been used with great effect over the years not only to assist nations in great need but also as a powerful tool to develop our own commercial export markets h i 9884 cor third and potentially most damaging are the strange things that the 1949 act has to say about how the commodity credit corporation can dispose of the surplus stocks that it acquires from time to time both present law and the new farm bill severely restrict the conditions under which the commodity credit corporation can dispose of surpluses and insure that such surpluses must be sold at prices sufficiently high to avoid disrupting the commercial price structure for farm products but the 1949 act contains few such assurances the 1949 act says the commodity credit corporation may sell its surpluses at 105 percent of the support priceor loan rate and sales at 105 percent of the loan rates which will be established under the 1949 act would mean miserably low prices to farmers but the problem does not stop there the 1949 act also says that there shall be no restrictionsand i repeat no restrictionson the price at which the commodity credit corporation can dispose of its surpluses if those stocks are sold on the export market if it sells for overseas delivery the corporation can dispose of stocks at any price it wishes to accepteven at prides below the loan rate it seems to itie that we would be extremely unwise to allow the law to revert to this situation which provides absolutely no protection to the farmer this is particularly dangerous at a time of large farm surpluses and great financial pressures on the federal government to avoid the substantial costs of keeping these surpluses in government storage there will certainly be a strong temptation to the federal government to dump its stocks at most any
