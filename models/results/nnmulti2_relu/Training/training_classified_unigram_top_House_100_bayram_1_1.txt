liberty in our hemisphere has been temporarily murdered by a close vote in this house this evening now i am not going to spend much time castigating anybody by name on the majority side of the aisle they gerrymandered themselves in my state into a majority so that one man long dead can laugh about the results of this vote because in 1982 when i was gerrymandered out of my seat on my first 6year goaround the congressman long dead who did it to me said that he would change seven seats in california and he did we were 22 to21 when that lame duck session ended in december 1982 and when we reconvened a few weeks later less than 3 weeks later the california delegation was not 22to21 we picked up two new seats and they went to liberals the new count was 28 to 17 an 11vote spread and what did we lose this vote by tonight five votes if they shifted from no to yes it would have been 216 to 214 and you could not have voted to break a tie five votes when my good friend from california mr berman told me this morning they were hoping deliciously that the margin of defeat would be buried in republican votes and it is twelve republicans voted against their president one of them ate up a half hour in the oval office in the last few days and then had a former president gerald ford spend another 30 minutes on the phone with him wasting his time wasting fords time and this is this gentlemans first vote against contra aid now when the president had tailored a package that sounded for all the world to me like the mccurdy plan named after dave mccurdy of oklahoma a year ago and when the president finally moves to the mccurdy plan mccurdy moves away from it here are five republicans that i think could win by 70 percent in their district if they change their vote because their district loves them and they would not care mr boehlert who got dan mitchells seat in upper new york state mr amo houghton who just for the first time voted against the presiden on contra aid mrs claudine schneider of rhode island beloved wins with 70 percent and could do whatever she wants mr tauke a bush cochairman of iowa i am a cochairman of bush in california so this kind of stings a little bit the fifth one is paul henry who holds gerald fords seat in michigan that ford held for 25 years now there is hope and i hope the ortega brothers are not laughing in their designer glasses tonight because at least 9 of these 12 republicans have told mei polled them on the floor before the votethey told me that they will switch their vote in an instant if ortega screws around with this peace process and does not start releasing these political prisoners and i know at least 30 people on the other side of the aisle because their careers are at stake that would switch in a minute if ortega tries to screw up this peace process now let me tell you a little story that the great lady who was once one of the shining lights of this deliberative body the incomparable claire booth luce told me a few years ago at the international hotel off of scott circle i said is it true claire that you told young presidentelect john p kennedy during the interregnum between eisenhowers 8 years and kennedys brilliant moving and powerful inaugural address the best i have ever heard in my lifetime because i did not get to hear abe lincolns two addresses i said did you tell kennedy that the measure of his presidency would be whether or not castros communism survived in the caribbean she said yes i did and let me tell you something mr dornan i intend to tell president reagan who was then himself a presidentelect that the measure of his presidency will be determined on whether or not communism maintains its foothold in central america and begins to spread now claire booth luce has gone to her eternal reward so i have no way of knowing whether she ever got to president reagan and said to him the same thing about nicaragua that she said to young president kennedy at 43 years of age before he was sworn in but i have a suspicion that she did and that is why president reagan said the other night that he did not become the president to preside over the communization of central america the irony is that you stood in this well and said of course he did not do that he is here to preside over the united states oh i see you are rewriting history right jimbo he is not the leader of the free world he is not the commander in chief of our military forces that has national security obligations that go beyond our borders i do not fault mr arias with only 10 000 police officers and security forces and no navy or army or marine corps or air force as such i do not fault him for operating in his countrys best interests but the united states of america has a right to operate in its best interest as the presidents have told me to my face as azcona told a distinguished colleague of mine on the floor dan burton and myself on september 6 to our face he told us that we must exercise our role of leadership as a superpower and not pay attention totally to what small little weak powers do to cover their own bets as to whether or not the ortega brothers survive in central america february 3 1 988 coi now i think the best essay i came acrossit violates the law of aristotle that nobody should sit down and dare to write philosophy until they are past their 50th birthday i do not know what his ideology is i think one of the most fascinating philosopher essayists in our country is charles krauthammer i think he started out as a liberal but he writes this editorial in the current issue of time on the back page titled whose foreign policy is it anyway and he says that quoting jim wright if we are willing to abide by the determination of those central americans themselves rather than allowing someone in the state department simply on his whim to say who is complying and he is not he says that statement of the house speaker about putting the contra aid in escrow to be released depending on future sandinista behavior to attack that is to say that we do not have a foreign policy and that is what you said here on the floor just a few minutes ago actually krauthammer says that the unitedstates congress with its vote this week now down by a shift of five has by default been designated to be the final judgment on sandinista compliance as though they had been complying on this floor tonight you said they have opened up papers that is not true one paper the press la prensa you said they have opened up radio stations there are 22 licenses pending there were 49 radio stations down there when somoza fell there is one radio station radio catolica and i did an interview on it just a couple of weeks ago and talked about the hidden bank accounts of the sandinistaortega brothers in switzerland and i pointed out on that radio show that a good idealistic marxistleninist following frederick engels dialectical materialism following in the path of that puritan leninist no good communist has a secret swiss bank account and if they do they had better not get caught well they are caught roger miranda has given us the number of the account and to the dollar value that is in humberto ortegas account and when i sponsored a 2hour meeting with him here last wednesday one of the congressmen said how come you know so much about the secret bank account and you know what major miranda said he said congressman i administered the secret account of the defense minister humberto ortega so i said to obando y bravoi spent 1 hour with him just about 10 days ago all alone his next meeting was with ortega as i left he got in his car to drive no ortega was coming to his house we passed like ships in the night the cardinal said to me yes we will run your interview i said will it get you in trouble i talked about their secret bank accounts trying to put wedges between these nine communist sandinistas and he said probably it will get us in trouble and i guess it ran this week i had someone call me and tell methe nicest compliment i have had in my lifethat i am public enemy no 1 to the sandinistas down there well that is fine because i cannot get out of my head during this whole debate those visits that i made with my 28yearold son to two of the farms in honduras where those amputeed victims young men and young women who are fighting for freedom fellow north americans fighting for our freedom right here on the mainland of this continent of ours as claude pepper says our beloved part of the world i cannot get over the fact that they said they would give tip their limbs again my son asked them what do you think when democrats get up on the house floor and say that you bayonet pregnant women they just shook their heads and one man said may i answer and he rolled his wheelchair forward he had all his limbs but they were all twisted and crippled and he said we are of the people we are campesinos the people call us los muchachos the boys the commandos that is why it is so ironic that one of the members from new jersey gets up and says if we drive the sandinistas to it they will go up in the hills the sandinista communists cannot go back into the hills because first of all they were city people it was a city movement the campesinos the peasants that run the hills hate the guts of these communists these fairskinned city boys that have betrayed their revolution how many interviews have we heard where the indians along the coast the suma the rama the miskitos said that somoza was a bum but he left us alone he only corrupted the city of managua and maybe leon how many times have we heard the mestizo the mixed bloods what we gringos refer to as indians from mexico all the way down to patagonia how many times have we heard them say we are the people fighting this war let me tell you something about roger miranda some of my own colleagues did not realize what i was getting at when we had him over here in the ollie north memorial briefing room no 227 and i said what was the straw that broke your back major what made you come over he told us he was a dedicated communist this is a privileged kid from managua he went and got his degree in economics at the university of santiago in chile that is when he told me he became a communist then he was privileged to go get a masters degree up at the autonomous public university in mexico city i said what turned you around more than anything else he said i went pi t on the battlefield along the rama road the road that runs to the east near el bluff on the coast he said i looked on the faces of the dead contras on the battlefield and i realized that all my idealism from my commitnist youth was a lie i was not saving my people as i thought from soioza i was slaughtering my people i said is it a fact that you can easily tell the campesinos the hard working peasants with their sun darkened skins the hard working people who work in the fields like cardinal obando y bravo by the way and he said yes it is easy to tell well that conclusion i had drawn before miranda said this to me that is why i asked this question because when i was talking to the mothers and the young sisters and the wives down in these little beatup storefronts that they are allowed to keep on one of the side streets in managua a month ago i remember september 6 or 7 when i was there with mr burton i said dan did you notice that these people are peasants and then i asked the embassy people what percentage of the 10 000 political prisoners are darker skinned peasants not citified young communists acting out their adolescent marxist fantasies on their people destroying the economy and clinging to their power with the rule of the gun and terror in these prison camps they said oh the political prisoners are 90 percent campesino peasants then i flashed back on all of the visits that we made to the contra camps tip in honduras which by the way are gone they are all inside nicaragua 14 000 of them and i said my gosh the whole force of the fighting people are dark skinned peas ants these are not the fair skinned guardia or the fair skinned sandinista city guys fighting to dump soioza and betray their revolution then it hit me that this was truly a peasant war a civil war i had some befuddled jesuit priest sitting in front of me over in my committee and i can talk in those terms because i may not want to characterize myself as devouti leave that to geraldine ferrarobut i am loyal and a loyal practicing catholic and when some jebby sits in front of me and i have got 7 years of jesuit education and tells me that if we had the equivalent number of people in our country in the hills 14 000 we would have an army in the hills of 1 5 million americans fighting against our government i said did it ever occur to you father if we had one and a half million american fighting commandos in the rocky mountains people would call it a civil war and he had nothing to say when you have 14 000 people fighting in those hills and it is not jungle the way it is commonly misreported by the press by the fourth estate up there it is more like the savanna or the serengeti plain in africa it is easy for helicopter gunships to hunt down these contras who try to move in the daytime now to tell you the truth this vote is so frustrating tonight that i know there are thousands upon thousands of people taking advantage of what we call in arms control talks national technical means i am trying to not violate house rules here about referring to that great expanded audience that is beyond these empty chairs here there are hundreds of thousands of frustrated americans that want a postmortem on this vote that want to know why all the members on our side only got 2 minutes and the members on their side seemed to have 6 8 or 9 minutes i will explain that we had almost twice as many speakers on our side out of 175 republicans two of our members are sick one of them just had a heart bypass out of their 267 members one of theirs is sick and another one just passed away he was a profreedomlover votedan daniel of virginia although they had almost 90 more members than we had we had twice as many speakers do you know why a lot of these members in the majority do not want to match their vote with rhetoric and words that will come back to haunt them with the republicans on this side i am proud of my party and those who did vote with the president because almost every one of them with polls against them in their districts are being called for a profile in courage voting against a misguided public in their districts they are willing to put their words together with their votes and they will stand by their words in the future the reason they are so nervous is this i wish the camera could have played across the faces of everybody on this side as claude pepper brought me to one of the dazzling moments of oratory in this house in his mideighties he was speaking without a note extemporaneously about freedom red white and blue is this distinguished gentleman our senior member in years in this house and the look on their faces was one of oh my gosh is he going to turn votes is he going to turn this with his inspirational speech because he is inspired by the cuban americans and his southern florida and they have risen as no initial first generation ever has in this country do you know that the cuban americans in south florida had seven members of the florida assembly in tallahassee no group of immigrants has ever done that we have two great hungarian americans here one republican and one democrat they were sitting together watching this debate this is pretty unusual for two people born in hungary to make it but we have all the great ethnic groups that make up this melting potmy irish jews poles oermans french and they all slaved in workshops and educated the next generation and that is where thr liticians came from the cubans are doing it in their first generation when i was down in south florida campaigning for bush a week before last they said to me why is our countrys freedom not on the agenda any longer they said we admire bushs courage ninetyeight percent of them are foreignborn and he said i will not lie to you we are not discussing cubas freedom and it is not on the agenda as far as we can see they said we love him but we want you to go to him congressman dornan and change that why shouldnt we be on the agenda and it is a darned good question and who shot them down the same cia that trained them under president kennedy that confiscated over 400 of their boats and locked them up in a bayou that i flew over once in south florida one of those back waterways cut out of the swamp they took their means of fighting for their freedom away from them and shut them down and they said ok we will make it in america but we are never going to give up we are praying for and waiting for that moment to drive that dictator castro out of cuba let me read from krauthammers editorial it is just absolutely dazzling what this man says this is entitled whose foreign policy is it anyway here is the line i love what then gives a costa rican more moral authority to decide the fate of nicaragua than 14 000 nicaraguans fighting to liberate their own country and asking only for the materials with which to do it i want to yield to my colleague the gentleman from indiana but before i do i want to tell something about this maj roger miranda i said roger how many fighters did you have in masaya on cbs news last night dan rather said masaya the birthplace of the revolution that toppled somoza it is a suburb just to the east of managuawell not a suburb but a separate city i said i know you were a combat hero in masaya were you the commander no i was the deputy how many sandinistas were there fighting i meant in all of nicaragua he misunderstood me he said 12 i said 12 he said 12 in masaya 12 of us in 1978 by 1979 after eden pastora who hates the communists who was their no i combatant fighter commandante zerohe was the only name known to the people of all the fighters most of the guttiest ones were killed in combat the ortega brothers were bankrobbers who were either in jail or in exile during the whole struggle but here was roger miranda the deputy commandante in masaya with 12 men he said by 1979 we had 98 i said only 98 he said but this was happening in the cities it was in the cities not the hills over nicaragua i said what was your sandinista fighting force at the end he said 2 500 the news media usually says 3 500 and so does your cia he said that there were 2 500 people how did they do it against somoza well for one thing jimmy carter turned back two israeli small freighters loaded with bullets that is what the president was asking for tonight just small arms to keep them as a viable fighting force and he was going to seal it up for 2 months until march 31 depending on whether the ortegas are going to keep the democratization process and open up more than one paper or more than one radio station and let out more than a handful of the 10 500 prisoners by tine way i asked obando bravo have you met one prisoner released of the socalled 1 000 that he released and he said no but honestly i had 4 or 5 calls and i am so busy shuttling back and forth to san josed and santo domingo and going to europe to brief ortega on what to expect from this tough anticommunist pope that i have not had a chance to return those calls i said monsignor which is the term you use in latin countries or your excellency or your eminence for a cardinal your eminence have you a list of 1 000 prisoners i said the american media is accepting ortegas release of 1 000 prisoners he said no no we are still below 100 now the networks say that ortega is going to release thousands more and we do not have a list of over 100 of the socalled 1 000 that he has released when the israelis released 1 100 arabs on the northern border into lebanon the news cameras were there to record every single person released by name and we do not have any 1 000 people released then what i love is when he said they ended the state of emergency do you know what all your embassy people tell me down there when you have a police state as far gone as the rule of terror in managua what difference does it make if you end the state of emergency nothing changes the peasants down there told me nothing changes if he ends the state of emergency it doesnt change any of the terror in this state i know the sovieth at this very moment are telegraphing to the kremlin the results of this vote gorbachev has been emboldened by this vote tonight i hate to report that but it is a fact he will see that we do not have a resolve he wonders where our resolve comes from in afghanistan that is another hypocritical irony of the voting patterns in this house but this lourdes as they say in french lourdesin cuba is this major listening facility the biggest in the western hemisphere where they are reporting on this vote to the kremlin tonight i had a briefing from the new national security adviser yesterday the whole foreign affairs committee did and about 10 of us showed up out of 40 and they told us there is not 11 prisons camps or 12 in nicaragua their only growth industry their only building program it is now up to 16 16 major prisons under the hated olilgarchs of somoza there was one and a quartertipitapa which is now expanded to five times its size and one little torture operation that he had behind the international hotel that had 12 cells in it but now they have 16 prisons and 9 of them are devoted totally to locking up the campesinos off the coffee and cotton farms locking up thousands of people because the commandos the los muchachos swim in the sea of the people miranda told us the ortega brothers have already cut a deal with the soviet union for asylum in the soviet union if all goes bad the turning point when they realized they were in trouble was a year ago when humberto ortega the defense ministerjust as raoul castro is fidels brother humberto ortega controls the guns and the partys army as it was pointed out here and the party owns the military that is not a blue and white rondel on the side of these helicopters that is the sandinista party emblem it would have been like richard nixon trying to take over the whole pentagon and painting every air force airplane with that little dumb looking republican elephant with its trunk down i prefer the one with trunk in the air for victory and then suddenly he would say well i was thinking about resigning i wonder if the pentagon would agree to that since the pentagon is controlled by the national chairman of the republican party imagine if paul kirk had say over the commander in chief and the joint chiefs of staff that is the situation in nicaragua the only country in the world to my knowledge that is in this situation in all of the other countries even in the soviet union the army is the army of the soviet union controlled in its ultimate decisions by the party which runs the politburo 12 men under gorbachev but dictating to him more than he would ever let on but you could read the diplomatic traffic if you have the top secret clearance of a congressman and see how much they do control them at this stage so now let us take a iook at these prison camps here are 9 out of the 16 here was somozas only prisontipitapa they like to call it modelo the modern prison part of it is where they keep the women this black urea here is the old somoza prison it is expanded three times by physical plant and five times by real estate this is estell this is the area where they first used soviet helicopter gunships flying tanks the mi25 the export version with a few avionics off of the mi24 that is used in afghanistan was first used here on august 2 1985 that was the first time soviet equipment was directly killing our fellow first cousins right here our norte americanos the mayor of esteli was just killed in combat and they tried to act like he was a political death he was in uniform doing his weekend warrior duty as a reserve officer this is la palmera prison this is near the tlilrd largest city grenada it is a brand new prison this is zona franco right near the airport every american senator and congressman who has gone down there flies right over this prison in these prisons tonight they are getting the word because the grapevine is an amazing thing it is like jungle drums the word is already reaching these godforsakenwell god has not forsaken themthese libertyforsaken people rotting in these prisons they are getting the word that by a lousy shift of five votes this congress has destroyed their hope i wish i had all 16 pictures here this is puerto cabezas on the coast i got a topsecret briefing down there i have to be careful what i say now the soviet union and the cubans have been jerryrigging sovietmade transports to try to shoot down these freedom fighter airlift airplanes with 57millimeter cannons with rockets 3inch rockets they have actually fired at some of these planes coming in at night and they are on the cheap down there they do not get the high tech that we give through socalled covert programs to afghanistan that dan rather loves to keep showing on the evening news it seems like everybody around here loves the afghanistan effort i want to comment on that in a second but right out of here they are building surfacetoair missile sites they lucked out and got this dc6 with people dying and with colombian pilots dying for us in the cause of freedom but puerto cabezas the sam site there would probably have gotten one sooner or later this is ascuncion prison near julgalpa look at the size of that thing as i said even the military installations which are the only other building projects are not as big as these prisons this is club hipico guess what that is a former motel when i first looked at that i said is that a club mcd somebody said oh yes so finally i went up to matagalpa about 5 weeks ago and met with some of the people up there i met with the mothers in the main cathedral in the middle of matagalpa which again was one of the fighting places that got rid of soinoza only to have their revolution betrayed we drove by club hipico which was an old motel rebuilt and turned into another one of these vicious political prisons this is palo alto near managua this is not an extension of stanford university look at these places this is chimandega up along the coast near corinto where soviet freighters are unloading during this entire debate soviet freighters are unloading weapons of killing this is 2 billion worth as was pointed out here when ortega was down conning everybody at san jose he had just left his deputies to sign a 294 million contract with the soviets with gorbachev just 2 weeks ago that was while we had a congressional team down in san jose costa rica they were advising the communists as it came out in the debate here this is waswali prison look at the size of that place all the building materials down there are going to these gulagtype fascisttype concentration camps it is unbelievable the torture stories that are now coming out from the human rights groups it sickens me that some of the contras we are supporting in their fight revert to the brutality that somoza engendered that creates human rights violations many of them have been courtmartialed some of them have been executed in the field and yes some of them are not serving their sentences i have griped about that but all the people down there that are worthy of the word truth tell me that the violations on the sandinista side are 10 to 1 but we would not get that out of some of the befuddled bishops networking nuns and trendy ministers and vicars to quote henry hyde on this house floor and that is exactly what they are trendy and listen to this with all these misstatements of facts here before i proceed let me ask the gentleman from indiana if he wants to jump in at this point if so i will yield to the gentleman"], [5.960464477539062e-07, 0.9999994039535522, 1, "i rise today to commend those members of the judiciary committee who joined me in the 99th congress on october 17 1986 to request of the attorney general of the united states that an independent counsel be appointed to pursue the revelations that were coming forward from the downing of a c123 cargo plane on october 5 of that same year laden with munitions that seemed to have apparently been involved with private efforts to support the contras from this humble beginning and the outpouring of other events related to this we now find ourselves in the incredible and very difficult situation that now engulfs the executive branch of the government so i wanted to thank my colleagues the gentleman from california mr don edwards the gentleman from connecticut mr bruce morrison the gentleman from michigan mr george crockett the gentleman from massachusetts mr barney frank the gentleman from wisconsin mr robert kastenmeier our former colleague from ohio john seiberling the gentlewoman from colorado mrs patricia schroeder the gentleman from california mr howard berman the gentleman from ohio mr feighan and the gentleman from west virginia mr staggers those colleagues of ours on the judiciary committee it seems to me have done a very very important service to this nation in determining that long ago some 5 months ago we were in need of an independent counsel to investigate these activities in connection with that petition to the courts and to the attorney general it was required that we present some theory of the activities that would justify the courts complying with our request that an independent counsel or special prosecutor be appointed so we had to construct from that point of view some indication of a factual nature as to what may have happened that would require the granting of our request and i would like now to just go back over that with the members we must remember that this was back in october of 1986 and here is the submission that we made to the department of justice we said this it has been reported that in december 1983 a series of meetings involving lt col oliver north central intelligence agency director william casey the vice president of the united states george bush thenwhite house counselor edwin meese theninterior secretary william clark and president ronald reagan and others took place to plan a supply network to the contras it is said that these efforts were undertaken in anticipation of congressional prohibitions on aid to the armed rebels lt col oliver north is reported to have been given principal responsibility in administering the supply operation and is reported to have had frequent contact with the contras through intermediaries including united states general retired singlaub and robert owen donald gregg the vice presidents national security advisor and retired general richard secord were also detailed to assist the coordination of the network it is also reported that the unitedstates officials planned to fund the nicaraguan rebels through highly unusual and illegal methods on november 25 1986 attorney general edwin meese acknowledged in a press conference that funds obtained from arms sales to iran had been transferred to the nicaraguan contras lt col oliver north and national security advisor john poindexter were said to be immediately involved several trips to iran paid for with united states funds seem to have been made by united states officials or representatives to discuss arrangements news organizations reported that chief of staff donald regan had been informed and approved the details of the iran arms sales it also was reported by news organizations on november 27 1986 that documents might have been destroyed relating to the arms sales to iran and benefits from those sales derived and forwarded to the contras the initial supply network plan was reportedly drafted by lt col oliver north and to have been approved by thennational security council counselor robert mcfarlane and president reagan from 1984 to 1986 when direct or indirect unitedstates official involvement with the contras was prohibited by law the supply network seems to have flourished the supply network seemed to involve the use of unitedstates funds at air bases and elsewhere in violation of unitedstates law unitedstates officials were alleged to have been involved in and knowledgeable of activities that may have constituted felonies including illegal arms shipments neutrality law violations foreign agents registration act violations and other criminal acts during the 2 years in which legal prohibitions on involvement with the contras were in place key individuals who say that they were involved in the supply efforts claimed to have frequent contact with administration officials and that their activities were known to those officials general singlaub for instance who acknowledged publicly his principal role in the supply efforts said in a 60 minutes interview with mike wallace on october 5 1986 that he kept informed cia director william casey about his activities in supplying the contras with military aid and received encouragement from him there were also reports singlaub acknowledged clearing his actions with north and meeting frequently with cia director william j casey the hearst syndicate also reported on may 15 1986 that general singlaub operating with unitedstates gov ernment approval agreed to provide arms and other supplies to nicaraguan rebel leader eden pastora also during the time in which the restrictions were in place public funds are reported to have been used to assist efforts to supply the contras department of defense funds are said to have been used to upgrade military airfields at ilopango in el salvador aguacate jamastran and mocoron funds are also reported to have been used to maintain safehouses pay telephone bills and other activities that may be directly related to the supply network flight logs also showed that pilots involved in the supply efforts including one killed in the october 5 downing of the c123 which had eugene hasenfus aboard had flown to sensitive unitedstates military bases including bases inside the united states where classified military research is conducted individuals receiving public moneys including official contracts seem to have been involved in aiding the contras and administering the supply network john hull an american with cia connections who lives in costa rica is reported to have received 10 000 monthly from the nsc in 1984 and 1985 to coordinate contra operations it was alleged during that time that robert owen who received contracts from nhao used oliver norths office in his capacity as unofficial liason to the contras and fundraiser for them it is also reported that robert owen worked to aid the contras through private channels while working as a consultant to the nhao at the state department two sources are said to have told senator kerrys staff that they witnessed owen engaged in arranging a weapons transaction with adolfo calero in the united states in the period when the boland amendment was in force illegal arms shipments were alleged to have transpired and the office of the unitedstates attorney commenced investigation into them in miami one such shipment seems to have originated from fort lauderdalehollywood fl airport on march 6 1985 and was coordinated by john hull and robert owen who met the shipment at ilopango military base in el salvador francisco chanes who is an official of legal humanitarian aid is also alleged to have been involved in the arms shipment any administration involvement in this incident or knowledge of it and failure to report it could constitute a criminal violation key law enforcement officials who may have feared public and congressional reaction to revelations of illegalities on the part of the contras and their associates may have exerted pressure to slow or halt the investigation at this point information obtained by senator kerry does not seem to have been acknowledged or acted upon at that time two unnamed law enforcement officials in an interview said that attorney general meese and former deputy attorney general lowell jensen applied pressure to slow the investigation of illegal arms shipment from hollywood airport the c123 cargo plane downed on october 5 1986 revealed additional information an identification card found in the wreckage of the downed c123 identified captured flier eugene hasenfus as an adviser in the unitedstatesa group at the ilopango air base in el salvador entrance onto the base by americans was said to require approval by unitedstates officials hasenfus it had been frequently reported was recruited by members of the network established by the administration an unnamed salvadoran familiar with cia activities in el salvador and also knowledgeable of the supply operation is quoted as saying do you think the salvadoran government would let hundreds of guns and big airplanes fly in and out of here for more than a year taking stuff to the guerrillas if the united states government didnt tell them to approving access to the base maintained with unitedstates funds could constitute unauthorized assistance subsequently hasenfus is quoted as saying that 24 to 26 cia personnel acted as flight crews and maintenance crews that they were also involved in refueling of flights that came through ilopango and that they helped create the flight plans all fuel at ilopango is thought to be purchased by either the cia the pentagon or the unitedstates military aid program at a press conference hasenfus is reported to say that max gomez and another cia employee were responsible for the logistics and flight plans for private contra supply flights mr gomez it is recalled was recommended by none other than the vice president of the united states national advisor mr donald gregg to the salvadoran air force as a counterinsurgency specialist and the distinguished vice president of the united states mr busn and mr gregg are reported to have met with gomez on at least two occasions mr gomez is also reported to have dined with the ambassador to el salvador mr edwin corr the ambassador stated at one point that he did not know mr gomez several days after that statement an embassy spokesman retracted the ambassadors comments there are indications that unitedstates funds were used to support gomezs activities at a time when such support was specifically prohibited by law in a report in october 27 of last year it was stated that three salvadoran workers were paid by the unitedstates embassy to work on mr max gomezs house in addition the captured flier mr hasenfus claims to have stayed at mr gomezs residence located at 5272 pasco escalon in san salvador when a reporter an american reporter attempted to visit the location and gain entry it is reported that armed security agents carrying unitedstates embassy identification cards appeared promptly at the scene the reporter was turned away also in october of last year captured flights and record logs show that at least 15 private flights carrying weapons to resupply the contras originated at the honduran military base of aguacate and some used the airfield at mocoron both improved with unitedstates military exercise funds but unitedstates spokesmen for the exercises insisted that the airfields were only used to give american soldiers practice in field construction techniques and said they would not be used for or by the contras because of laws prohibiting indirect or direct aid to the contras captured flight logs also record trips to highly sensitive unitedstates military bases including one in nevada that is said to have conducted classified military research nicaraguan troops are said to have recovered a navigational targeting instrument from the cockpit of the plane which mr hasenfus said was placed there by the central intelligence agency to allow pilots to make more accurate drops of weapons shipments phone bills from a safe house in san salvador where mr hasenfus and others stayed are reported to show numerous calls to lieutenant colonel norths private line at the national security council in the capital of our nation the phone records show a series of calls to mr norths colonel norths office arms merchants and air supply companies were involved in these telephonic transactions it is suspected that the unitedstates government paid for these phone bills as unnamed unitedstates official is quoted as saying that the economic support funds for el salvador honduras and guatemala had been diverted and were critical to the supply network any number of other events reported including that of richard secords involvement in arranging for third parties to supply the contras including key officials and individuals in saudi arabia in possible exchange for a favorable disposition of the awac deal of saudi arabia have been noted it is also reported that the attorney general of the united states edwin meese and deputy attorney general donald jensen applied pressure on the office of the unitedstates attorney to halt or slow the investigation into illegalities emanating out of contra supply efforts as it might have interfered with the administrations foreign policy goals this was information that the members of the judiciary committee provided the attorney general and ultimately the threeman federal court in asking for an independent counsel and suggesting possible alleged illegal efforts by the unitedstates officials to assist the contras that involved such conflicts of duty on the part of the attorney general and others in the department of justice that an independent counsel should be appointed and i am very very pleased of course to suggest to you that they were appointed and that mr walsh is on the job and

trumans birthday on may 8 1945 to crush mussolini and hitler and then you had a handful of days until the shooting stopped on august 15 1945 and it appeared that a country starting from scratch with broomhandle guns and tin cans on sticks simulating mortars in the louisiana army war maneuvers of 1940 with lieutenant colonel eisenhower in just 3 years and 5 months and a day we crushed this nazi terror around the world and this numbing effect that has taken us over the last 8 years with the emergence of the communist dictatorship 9 years this last july 19 the sandinistas have been in power one thing popped into my mind when the gentleman talked about numbing members of this congress in recent years created a first in the capital of managua two members of this chamber including the gentleman from michigan that i debated on crossfire tonight who sat in as speaker pro tempore for about the longest period of anybody tonight they went down to managua and kicked unitedstates state department people out of the room so that they could have a secret meeting with the communist dictator and his staff in the capital of managua the embassy people down there told me a few weeks later when i was there septemnber 22 1 988 that they were shocked that they would be told to get out of tile room as though they could not be trusted they usually take notes about american appearances around the world not to eavesdrop i have just been at meetings with communist functionaries in mongolia in the soviet union in poland i wanted the trained ambassadorial people the staff of our state department around the world to not only brief me before i go in to sit there and witness what i am being told to use their language skills but then after i have had the meeting to debrief what took place at that neeting i had a stunning meeting with the head of the entire prison system in the soviet union and the head of all of the police officers 66 000 precincts as he put it in the soviet union nobody in the internal affairs ministry in moscow has ever met with a unitedstates senator or a unitedstates congressman and that happened to me just at the end of last month i wanted the state department people there to analyze this plus to translate for me but it became a regular occurrance in nicaragua the only nation on the face of the earth where we have diplomatic exchanges and recognition of governments only there did members of the majority party liberal democrats go down there and demand private meetings with the communist dictators instead of an incident being made about it on the house floor and instead of secretary of state shultz bringing it before speaker wright and speaker wrights attention calling in the gentleman who is majority leader in the senate when it was robert dole when we were in the majority and the majority leader now and getting to the root of this thing instead because of national technical means some of the dialog that transpired in those meetings went back and forth let me tell my colleagues something in very careful diplomatic language of my own but i can tell anybody in this chamber who wants to hear it off the floor every member of our embassy in honduras top to bottom every member of our ambassadorial staff in costa rica top to bottom believes that a member of the other chamber is having an affair with a female officer of the government of costa rica and is sharing that mistress with the highest ranking people in that government of costa rica and that member of the other body positions himself in san jose and would use air force airplanes and time and fuel to fly individually to guatemala for meetings back to san jose to tegucigalpa honduras back to san jose fly to el salvador and back to san jose to every country in that area always returning to the san jose base so he is carrying on his affair i had what they call a country team briefing i said wait a minute this is important what you are telling me because it compromises this persons integrity you are telling me everyone of you in this room agrees with this do you do you do you everybody on this staff what does our embassy all of them think down there in costa rica they all agree with the same facts that this unitedstates senator is having an affair with one of the high dignitaries in this government female and that so is another high ranking person

merit in what you say about these people on the fringes of our sphere of influence as you call it i asked our fine ambassador there jack matlock i hope you didnt mind me bringing up some tough questions about nicaragua at this lunch and the ambassador said congressman it was excellent what you did these people must hear from american senators and congressmen how you feel about this regime

important strategic issues that compel us to continue to search for a modernized landbased icbm force first some history in 1983 the scowcroft commissiona highly respected bipartisan group of strategic thinkersconvened to address the continuing problem of modernizing the landbased icbms this highly respected commission carefully reviewed the issues and concluded that attempting to solve all icbm issues with a single missile in a single basing mode made the problem of modernizing the icbm force so complex as to be virtually insoluble therefore the commission recommended a threepronged approach which suggested first prompt deployment of 100 mx missiles in minuteman silos to immediately reduce the soviet advantage in icbm capability second development of a small singlewarhead icbm to be deployed in the early 1990s in such a way to enhance survivability and stability and third vigorous investigation into followon icbm basing technologies to enhance future icbm survivability this approach was accepted by the president and unanimously supported by the secretary of defense the national security council the joint chiefs of staff the secretary of state and the congress which authorized the air force to proceed but as you know the bipartisan consensus did not last long congress decided to cap the deployment of mx missiles in silos at 50 due to continuing concern over survivability we also told the administration to look again at icbm survivability and gave the department of defense funds to explore alternative basing technologies along with the small icbm well the air force did exactly what we asked them to do they came back with another examination of icbm basing and this time combined the elements of mobility and deception we implored them to consider now we have before us the presidents proposal to develop a basing mode to garrison missiles in railroad cars on sac bases and to develop the small icbm this dual approach finally solves the icbm

of our nonproliferation policy toward pakistan has generated contempt for american law and american policy from the government of pakistan more important the weakness of this bills nonproliferation language with respect to pakistan will foster grave danger to the security and stability of south asia and the world even as we move toward greater nuclear stability between the superpowers in europe we are sliding down the road to a nuclear arms race between pakistan and india but if a nuclear war breaks out in the next 10 years it is more likely to be in south asia not in europe this week reagan and gorbachev began to close a small window to nuclear confrontation in europe tragically the house has left open the door to nuclear confrontation in south asia the reagan administration concedes that we have no greater interest in south asia than preventing nuclear weapons proliferation the question is what are we willing to do about it are we going to talk or act weve already tried to jawbone pakistan into stopping their nuclear bomb program we gave pakistan talk but no action on nuclear nonproliferation and they gave us talk but no action on nuclear restraint in return american law prohibits aid to countries that operate unsafeguarded enrichment facilities but we waived that law for pakistan for 6 years we have given pakistan one of the massive and sophisticated aid packages in the world that aid package was supposed to induce the pakistanis to restrain their nuclear program clearly that approach has failed rather than restraint pakistan has responded with a blatant and continuing violations of our laws and their promises to us they tried to smuggle krytrons maraging steel and beryllium out of the united states in blatant violation of our technical security laws this spring even as the administration was arguing for another 6year waiver for pakistan a pakistani native was bribing american officials and falsifying documents to smuggle restricted maraging 350 steel to pakistan when the foreign affairs committee took a soft line on pakistan did that lead to pakistani restraint it had the opposite effect after congress action the same pakistani expanded his illegal smuggling efforts to try to get beryllium which is a component of a nuclear bomb some on the other side argue that if we strongly resist the pakistani nuclear weapons program they will accelerate that program but it doesnt make sense to me that they will give up a 4 billion aid package in favor of a bomb that will buy them only problems in the near term the problem is we havent made them choose the pakistani nuclear weapons program is like a car hurtling down a precipice we have one pedal to pushmaking unitedstates aid conditional on an end to nuclear enrichment some say that this pedal is the accelerator we say it is the brake but one thing is sureif we dont push it were going to crash anyway seven years ago we were debating the nuclear program in india we buckled now were debating the nuclear program in pakistan and were buckling in a few years will we be debating the nuclear program in iran some seem to argue that if one country has the bomb everybody should have the bomb that is wrong we dont want an equal opportunity nuclear weapons proliferation program nuclear weapons are not a good thing they are a bad thing we want to reduce nuclear weapons not increase and spread them whether it is a pershing ii or ss20 in europe or a basement bomb in pakistan or india a bomb is a bomb is a bomb and a nuclear war is a nuclear war whether it is between us and the russians or between india and pakistan some say the genie is out of the bottle and we cannot stop nuclear proliferation they are wrong nonproliferation has worked in sweden it has worked in korea it has worked in taiwan it can work in pakistan if we make it work some raise the question of indias nuclear program i am no stranger to this issue members who were here in 1980 will remember that i led the fight against the shipment of nuclear fuel to indias tarapur reactor for nonproliferation reasons in that i was opposing the carter administration but india is not the issue here in the south asian nuclear proliferation crisis today pakistan is the problem india like china and russia has exploded a nuclear device we cannot unexplode it but india has not stockpiled nuclear weaponsyet they will if pakistan goes ahead with the bomb and pakistan will go ahead if we dont stop them there is only one country in the world to get a special waiver of our nonproliferation law that country is pakistan if members are concerned that we are unfairly singling pakistan out i assure them that that need not be the case i have prepared an amendment that would strike all special language relating to pakistans nuclear program and apply to pakistan the same law we apply to everyone else in fact despite all its illegal activity pakistan does not get specially harsh treatment it gets specially lenient treatment there are nuclear proliferation problems elsewhere we should address them but we cannot wait for progress on any front to make progress on any front some opponents of strong action on nonproliferation argue that the parkistani bomb program is a regional problem they are only part right nuclear proliferation is not just a regional problem but a global problem involving the superpowers and every other nation in the world the soviet union wanted the bomb because we had the bomb china wanted the bomb because the soviet union had the bomb india wanted the bomb because china had the bomb now pakistan wants the bomb because india has the bomb and if pakistan gets the bomb iran will want the bomb at some point we have to say stop we can stop nuclear proliferation if we want to despite their contempt for our nonproliferation policy pakistan is the fourth largest reciplent of united states aid in the world what have we gotten for our last 3 billion package of aid to pakistan pakistan refuses to give us military bases their best friend is the peoples republic of china they give the plos yaser arafat 21gun salutes on official visits they send troops to saudi arabia to be deployed against israel although saudi arabia recently sent these troops home because of pakistans close relationship with the regime in iran and pakistan remains a military dictatorship compare this with staunch united states allies such as the philippines or korea these emerging democracies get far less aid than pakistan even though they open their territory to american military naval and air bases and the philippines korea and taiwan are not engaged in a pellmell program to build a nuclear bomb what effect will the pakistani bomb have on american sbcurity remember that pakistan is first an ally of communist china second an islamic country and only third a friend of the united states just because our interests converge on afghanistan doesnt mean they converge elsewhere iran too supports the afghan mujahideen we dont support iran pakistans bomb program is reportedly funded by libya and saudi arabia let me quote from pakistans president general zia who spoke last year about the aggressive talk about the pakistani nuclear bomb it is our right to obtain the technology and when we acquire this technology the entire islamic world will possess it with us when time magazine reported general zias admission that pakistan had developed a nuclear bomb capability he called the press reports a zionist conspiracy against pakistan some try to confuse the issue by citing pakistans support of the afghan mujahideen i strongly support the afghan freedom fighters but afghanistan should not prevent all progress on preventing nuclear war afghanistan did not prevent reagan and gorbachev from making progress on nuclear arms control in europe and it should not prevent us from making progress on nuclear arms control in south asia the mujahideen have nothing to do with pakistans nuclear weapons program pakistans aid to the afghan rebels was not bought with american aid and will not end if we suspend it let me quote from the ambassador of pakistan pakistans opposition to the soviet invasion of afghanistan commenced with the invasion itself and certainly long before the first unites states aid package was initiated nothing will deflect us from adhering to these same principles pakistan supports the mujahideen because it is in their own national interests not because we bribed them pakistan supported the afghan rebels before we gave them any aid they support them now when we have in fact suspended aid and they will support them in the future if we continue to suspend our aid but suspending aid is not the objective of the nonproliferation amendment the objec tive is to stop a nuclear bomb program consider carefully what we are talking about there is no stability to an indopakistani nuclear arms race india and pakistan are not separated by oceans they are right next to anotherthey share a disputed border there is no warning time for a nuclear attack by india or pakistan there are no survivable nuclear delivery systems one of pakistans f16s was destroyed recently when it hit a wild boar on the runway crisis stability in an indopakistani nuclear standoff is zero and pakistan and india have fought three wars since 1947 they may well fight another one before the century is out the question is will that be a conventional war or a nuclear war it is time to stop compromising our overriding longterm interest in nuclear nonproliferation for shortterm political and diplomatic concers when a nuclear bomb goes off in south asia when the superpowers are drawn into a third world nuclear war it will be too late to learn from our mistakes we must act now a stitch in time saves nine today we had and let pass an opportunity that may not come again we could have acted to prevent a nuclear arms race before it is too late we must not continue

administrative office of unitedstates courts the american bar association the federal public and community defenders and the national association of criminal defense lawyers the technical amendments correct grammatical punctuation and spelling errors the other amendments make minor substantive changes in current law for example current law prohibits the transmittal of wagering information from a stage where gambling is legal to a foreign country even if gambling is legal in that foreign country the bill amends that provision to permit the transmittal of gambling information if gambling is legal in the state from which the information is transmitted and in the foreign country to which the information is transmitted another minor substantive change concerns the temporary release of a person who is hospitalized following an acquittal by reason of insanity for a serious offense current law is silent about such furloughs the bill amends current law to provide that such a person may be temporarily released from the hospital only if first the committing court approves second a federal law enforcement officer accompanies the person or third thereis an emergencysuch as the persons need for immediate medical attention a death of a family member would not be an emergency within the meaning of this provision also in the area of the insanity defense the bill amends a provision of current law that requires a hospital to submit annual reports on the mental condition of persons committed to it after they have been acquitted by reason of insanity these annual reports go to the committing courts the bill amends current law to provide that for hospitalized persons who have been acquitted of an offense against someone protected by the secret servicesuch as the presidentthese annual mental condition reports must also be provided to the secret service the bill is at the desk today with an amendment that adds several other provisions some of these provisions make additional technical changes correcting punctuation and syntax in provisions of title xviii of the united states code and the federal rules of civil procedure one provision makes a minor substantive change to permit any licensed or certified psychologist not just licensed or certified clinical psychologists to conduct certain mental examinations this amendment has been agreed to by the interested parties finally the amendment adds to the bill a title ii that with only minor changes is identical to a bill which the house unanimously passed last term that revises the procedure by which amendments to the federal rules of evidence and to rules of procedure used in federal courts are drafted and take effect on behalf of the committee i want to acknowledge the work of christie quick an intern from

reason why only physicians should be permitted to administer the examination the massey court held that a rule 35 a mental examination could be conducted by a licensed psychologist who is not a physician rule 35 a however unambiguously precludes selecting such a person the massey court erred in not following the rule even if in that courts opinion the purpose of the rule was served by permitting a licensed psychiatrist to conduct the examination no matter how desirable that outcome as a matter of policy the massey decision is wrong as a matter of rule interpretation the massey courts conclusion that a licensed psychologist is as capable as a psychiatrist of carrying out mental examinations is consistent with section 142 of the bill before the house it would be appropriate

of titles 18 and 28 of the united states code known as the rules enabling acts set forth the procedure for amending various rules of procedure used by federal courts and the federal rules of evidence in brief the rulemaking procedure begins with an advisory committee of the judicial conference of the united states preparing an initial draft of a proposed new rule or amendment to an existing rule which it submits to the judicial conferences standing committee on rules of practice and procedure the judicial conference reviews any proposal recommended by the standing committee and submits that proposal together with the conferences recommendation to the supreme court the supreme court acts upon the judicial conferences recommendation and must before may 1 of any year promulgate any new rule or amendment to an existing rule of which it approves a new rule or amendment promulgated by the supreme court does not take effect until 90 days after promulgation 180 days after promulgation in the case of the federal rules of evidence in order to give congress an opportunity to review the new rule or amendment before it takes effect the rules enabling acts process worked well for many years with the federal rules becoming a model for the states new rules and amendments to existing rules routinely took effect without any congressional intervention in recent years however congress has taken a greater interest in new rules and amendments promulgated under the rules enabling acts congress intervened in 1973 to delay indefinitely the effective date of the proposed federal rules of evidence and subsequently enacted a congressional lydrafted rules of evidence along with an enabling act for the rules of evidence since then congress frequently has intervened either to delay the effective date of disapprove or modify rules and amendments promulgated under the rules enabling acts see h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 79 131 cong rec e177 daily ed feb 3 1986 remarks of rep

conference made several changes in the method by which it initiates proposed new rules and amendments these changes broadened participation in the rulemaking process and they should help ensure that proposed rules and amendments are thoroughly considered by the judicial conference and its committees before being forwarded to the supreme court last congress the subcommittee on courts civil liberties andthe administration of justice under the able leadership of its chairman the gentleman from wisconsin mr kastenmeier and its ranking minority member the gentleman from california mr moorhead undertook a review of the rules enabling act process that subcommittee held thorough hearings on the matter and drafted a bill to revise the rules enabling acts process and to increase

cong rec e177 daily ed feb 3 1986 remarks of rep kastenmeler correcting printing errors in h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 1985 the committee found that the rules enabling acts process lacked sufficient openness and that the rules enabling acts contain provisions that have already served their purpose including the supersession provisions the committee also found a proliferation of local rules many of which conflict with national rules of general applicability see h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sass 161t 1985 131 cong rec e177 daily ed feb 3 1986 remarks of rep kastenmeier correcting printing errors in h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 1985 the rules enabling acts contain supersession provisions while they are not all identically worded they are all very similar the supersession clause of the rules enabling act for the federal rules of civil procedure for example provides that all laws in conflict with any such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect originating in the rules enabling act of 1934 this clause sought to ensure the replacement of a large number of procedural statutes that it was believed would have been difficult to identify before those rules were promulgated see s burkank the rules enabling act of 1934 130 u pa l rev 1015 105054 1982 in addition the clause was thought necessary in order to avoid a conflict with the conformity act see id the original justification for the supersession clause isno longer valid see h r rep no 422 99th cong lsv sess 1617 2223 1985 131 cong rec e177 daily ed feb 3 1986 remarks of rep kastenmeier correcting printing errors in h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st seas 1985 the 1948 recodification of titles 18 and 28 of the united states code eliminated ihost of the pleading practice and procedure statutes and repealed the cbnformity act the supersession clause therefore no longer serves the purpose forwhich it was intended in addition to having fulfilled its purpose the supersession clause is unnecessary today because congress tends to legislate against the backdrop of the existing federal rules of practice and procedure see eg comprehensive crime control act of 1984 pub l no 98473 215 216 98 stat 201417 1984 amending rules 32 35 38 40 54 and 6 e 3 c of the federal rules of criminal procedure and rule 9 of the rules of procedure for the trial of misdemeanors before united states magistrates additionally congress has responded promptly when the judicial conference has criticized practice or procedure statutes that interfere with the efficient and just administration of the judicial system for example over many congresses a series of civil priorities were engrafted into the united states code judicial conference criticisms off those provisions led congress to repeal them pub l no 98620 401 98 stat 335657 1984 see h rep no 1062 98th cong 2d sess 1984 thus in practical terms the supersession clause is unnecessary moreover as a matter of policy it is unwise to permit a procedural rulemaking process to be used in effect to overturn provisions of law enacted by congress see h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 1314 1985 discussing proposed amendments to rule 68 of the federal rules of civil procedure 131 cong rec e177 daily ed feb 3 1986 remarks of rep kastenmeler correcting printing errors in h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 1985 finally the clause seems

see h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 2223 1985 that formulation permitted supersession of rules or parts of rules that had been amended by act of congress before the date of enactment of the legislation but would not permit supersession of any rule or a part of any rule amended by act of congress after the date of enactment since that would hamper the proper functioning of the rulemaking process section 202 of the bill before the house in proposed 28 unitedstatesc 2072 b 3 provides that a rule promulgated under 28 unitedstatesc 2072 supersedes a rule of practice or procedure or

riles by the judicial council of the appropriate circuit and that local rules established by the courts of appeals were to be reviewed for consistency with the national rules by the judicial conference that formulation however did not cover local rules that could be issued by federal courts that were neither district courts nor courts of appeals such as the court of claims and the court

orders tonight but obviously we think they are pretty important or else we would not be here the topic i would like to talk about tonight for a little bit is the problem of aids and the most recent report by masters and johnson the sex experts who have credentials that go all the way back i think to the sixties and maybe even beyond that they have been regarded fairly highly in the more liberal communities because of their views on sexual activity over the years and their approach to dealing with problems of sexuality but they have been maligned over the past few days regarding their views on the aids pandemic and the book that they recently wrote about the subject their book crisis is now out and the people who have read it from cdc and hhs have said that they have been raising issues that really are not valid in this battle against aids college i would like to divert my attention for just a moment if i might to another subject that i promised i would discuss tonight briefly and that is a subject that is not related to the aids epidemic but i think it is an important issue and that is the gallaudet college here in the washington area is going to be picking a new president in the not too distant future and i and some of my colleagues have played in basketball tournaments and games out there to raise funds for that institution it is a school for the deaf over the past few years we have been very interested in that institution doing well and being successful and gallaudet college will be picking a new president and one of the things that many of the people who attend that college and people who support that college wanted to request is that the new president be a member of the deaf community so that they could have empathy with the students and realize what they are going through and be a better administrator of the policies of that institution and i would just like to add my support to that effort to get a deaf president for gallaudet college because i think that speaks well for the institution in wanting someone who understands the problems of the deaf and i think there are people in the deaf community who could do an exceedingly good job out there at gallaudet and so i support that effort and urge those who may be interested to express their concern about gallaudet having a deaf president as well i would like to now get back to my subject tonight that being the aids threat and who is at risk and the book that was written by masters johnson and d kolodny some of the things that i think are very important to be discussed tonight are a subject that the cdc and hhs have poohpoohed over the past few years the title of the book is crisis heterosexual behavior in the age of aids it is by grove prese and i think it sells for 15 95 it is written by masters and johnson with the help of dr kolodny and they offer a bold troubling analysis of the aids threat to straights or those in the heterosexual community drawing on their own neverbeforepublished research findings and a pessimistic reading of existing statistics the authors conclude that the aids virus is breaking out of the drug community and the homosexual community into the heterosexual community contrary to the assurances of most health experts the authors declare that undetected aids infections are now running rampant in the heterosexual comiaunity while they concede that their projections are not beyond question they would prefer to err on the side of safety and generate realistic fear of the deadly virus and here is the question they ask this i think is very important shouldnt we be adopting precautions against the worst case possibility they ask rather than making the most optimistic assumption and therein i think as shakespeare would say lies the rub because those who are leading this country in the area of health care health protection at cdc center for disease control in atlanta and hhs health and human services are erring on the wrong side in my opinion they are erring on the side of the most optimistic case scenario rather than the pessimistic side and since we are up against something we have never faced before i think we better look at the worst case scenario and deal with it from that perspective rather than being optimistic masters johnson and kolodny found that only 1 of the 400 monogamous subjects tested positive for the antibodies for the virus and they tested 800 people in their research 400 of these people were monogamous oneman onewoman relationship and the other 400 had multiple sex partners of the 400 who were monogamous after they did the testing only 1 tested positive for aids but out of the 400 heterosexuals with multiple partners none of whom had other known risks for acquiring the infection that being involved with the drug culture or being a homosexual or bisexual person out of the 400 heterosexuals with multiple partners none of whom had other known risks for acquiring the infection an alarming 7 percent of the women and 5 percent of the men tested positive that infection rate is higher than any other study has found among heterosexuals outside of the established risk groups these findings are especially disturbing the authors say because heterosexuals with multiple partners are likely to carry the virus into the wider population they go on to say but the approximation of the size of the epidemic and their recommendations for curbing its spread are running sharply counter to the prevailing aids wisdom among their conclusions is that at least 3 million americans are currently infected with the aids virus twice the incidence estimated by the unitedstates centers for disease control now about 2 years ago the center for disease control in atlanta ga and health and human services estimated that we had 1 5 million people infected with the aids virus in this country they further estimated that the epidemic was doubling every 10 to 14 months now if you put a pencil to that you will see that we will have somewhere around 4 to 5 million infected right now but the center for disease control in atlanta still believes that we only have 1 5 million people infected why would their conclusion 2 years ago be incorrect why do we not have 3 or 4 million people infected today i think it is because they are concerned about a panic in this country therefore they want to keep these numbers artificially low but masters and johnson according to their study found that 3 million americans are currently infected twice what the unitedstates center for disease control estimated the authors also believe the 200 000 nondrugusing heterosexuals are probably infected that is 7 times what cdc has estimated that is 1 600 contaminated blood samples that may be escaping detection each year with almost as many transfusion recipients getting infected as before strict blood screening programs went into effect that is another subject i will probably be talking about on a successive night at some time in the future continuing it states that a critical tool in stemming the epidemic is mandatory hiv antibody testing for couples seeking a marriage license pregnant women convicted prostitutes and all hospital inpatients between the ages of 15 and 60 i have a bill pending in the congress of the united states that would test everybody in the country there is no pride of authorship in that bill i think we could make it a routine testing program starting at say age 6 or age 8 or 10 and go up to age 60 to age 65 we are open to suggestions on how to get at this virus this pandemic without going to the expense of testing everybody but so far i have not come up with any ap oach other than mandatory testing lhat is going to get at the root of the problem while cdc estimates that some 30 000 heterosexuals who have no other risk factors may be carrying the aids virus the authors of crisis warn that the figure may be as high as 200 000 this estimate is likely to prompt far more argument than the authors overall estimate of 3 million infected americans which falls within the upper range of projections made by other experts as cdc researchers led by dr james curran recently wrote in the journal science it will remain a difficult challenge to accurately determine aids virus incidence in the united states now listen to that question as cdc researchers led by dr james curran recently wrote in the journal science it will remain a difficult challenge to accurately determine aids virus incidence in the united states now listen to that question dr james curran said it will remain a difficult challenge to accurately determine the incidence of aids virus in the united states my question to dr curran is why why is it so difficult to find out if we tested the vast majority of the people in this country the people from grade school age to 65 we would know where march 9 1 988 it is spreading the fastest how it is spreading who is spreading it and we would know so much more about the disease than we know right now that it is not even funny and yet you say in this article in the science magazine the journal science that it will remain a difficult challenge to accurately determine the incidence of aids in the united states it need not be that difficult if we get on with the mandatory testing program which i advocate which dr allen salzburg of miles city mt advocates he has done an extensive study which i will refer to in a moment masters johnson and kolodny now are calling for a massive testing program so why is it that the cdc and hhs will not go along with that the fact of the matter is this pandemic will continue to get bigger and bigger spread out of control unless we get on with testing the vast majority of americans so we can find out how it is being spread and where and so forth to researchers who believe heterosexual spread is not a major concern masters johnson and kolodny say in effect prove us wrong indeed they argue that health authorities need to do more to come up with solid data to the best of our knowledge kolodny told newsweek neither the cdc nor any other group has yet conducted a broad national study of heterosexuals and in the absence of that to proclaim that that population isnt infected seems irresponsible i agree to make the kind of statements that cdc and hhs are making that there are not a lot of people affected in the heterosexual community when they have no test data to back that up is irresponsible i think that masters johnson and kolodny ought to be congratulated on the work they are doing other critics will no doubt attack the views of masters johnson and kolodny on mandatory testing as one aids expert put it their opinions may legitimize the kooks who want to test everyone well think about this the average incubation time for aids varies depending on who you talk to from 7 to 12 years some people believe that an aids carrier can carry it for up to 30 years without any manifestation of the disease now during that period of time they come in contact with other human beings many of these people have sexual contacts now everybody they come in contact with will not know that the person they are having relations with has the aids virus the person who has the aids virus in the first place may not know it so the disease can spread in almost an exponential manner because nobody knows that they have it how do you determine that a person has the aids virus if they do not have fullblown aids and they are dying from some kind of an invasive disease that takes advantage of the immune deficiency caused by the aids virus the only way to know is through testing the only way to know is through testing and the longer we wait the broader the epidemic is going to be the worse it is going to be for all of us in this country unitedstates surgeon general c everett koop said recently there is always a danger whenever people engage in casual sex outside the marriage relations relationship even if their promiscuity is heterosexual but he noted what is unknown is the level of danger the masters and johnson book sounds an alarm about a crisis whose true dimensions wont be known for years now think about that our surgeon general is saying that the dimensions of this disease will not be known for years what he is saying in effect is that it is going to continue to spread and there is no way of knowing how far it will spread and we are going to have to let it go unabated except for maybe throwing out some educational materials to each household in this country and let it go on the fact of the matter is something can be done about it and can be done rather rapidly the unitedstates army tested 2 million servicemen in a period of less than a year to 18 months and it was a very effective test the head of the military testing program said in my presence to dr koop at a seminar that was going on here in the capitol that testing everybody in the united states is doable and it can be done within a reasonable period of time so why tarry more and more people are being infected everyday as a matter of fact col donald burke who developed the armys testing program said we have a diagnostic tool here to not use that tool just doesnt make sense it just does not make sense so when dr koop and others at the cdc and hhs start telling us that there is no way of knowing how big the epidemic is or how big it is going to be for years to come because we just simply will not see the manifestation of the disease that is totally irresponsible because if people carry the virus for an average length of 12 years let us say and that is what most people would agree is the average incubation time you are not going to know how many people who are infected today are going to have the aids virus until they come down with fullblown aids and are dying what about the other people they have infected who are going to carry the disease on for another 12 or 15 years those people are walking time bombs infecting people of this country and testing is the only way we are going to get to the bottom of this it is absolutely essential masters johnson and kolodny say it scares the hell out of me they say why arent todays massive screening programs for blood banks and the military picking of the degree of heterosexual hiv infection indicated by the new masters and johnson study they said the most sexually active people are not by and large going to be looking to sign on to military regimentation says kolodny he went on to say nor are they apt to be the most altruistic people donating blood but they are a major vector of sexually transmitted disease into the larger heterosexual community the authors warn calling for widespread mandatory hiv testing of pregnant women marriagelicense applicants and most hospital patients they went on to say in other parts of their book indlcatic rs are that the aids virus is slowly but surely working its way into the younger population of our countrythe future of americathe 15 to 24 yearold age groupwhich has at least in the last quartercentury been the primary wedge driving epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases in the united states and elsewhere across the world the inadequacies of schoolbased education about aids can be seen in the findings of a 1986 survey of over 800 massachusetts teenagers 16 to 19 years old twentynine percent did not know that the virus can be passed from females to males although 70 percent said they were sexually active only 15 percent had made any changes in their sexual behavior because of concern about aidsand only 1 in 5 of these did so in a way that could be judged effective from what i can see all this fuss about aids is pretty much exaggerated says one 17year old boy ive only slept with three girls this year and i knew them all pretty well that kind of ignorance will led to this pandemic spreading in an exponential manner we will not get control of it as long as people are not better educated than that and until we can identify those who have the disease and tell them that they must change their ways and can no longer have sexual contact with people outside the aids community the only way to do that is through testing all these considerations point in one direction aids is breaking out into the heterosexual community the aids virus is now running rampant in the heterosexual community unless something is done to contain this global epidemic we face a mounting death toll in the years ahead that will be the most formidable the world has ever seen now think about that they are predicting that if we do not do something pretty quickly this is masters johnson and kolodny in their new book that this thing is going to be worse than anything we have seen in history and that includes the bubonic plague in the 14th and 15th centuries that wiped out over half of europe millions and millions of people died now can we afford to dillydally can we afford to go on with our heads in the sack and not pay attention to what is going on around us i think not mandatory testing according to dr salzburg of miles city mt who is not only an excellent doctor and scientist but a computer whiz as well that if we do not start testing almost everybody in this country in the sexual active age groups of people who are in school if we do not start testing by 1990 or 1991 his projections are that by 1995 to 1998 in that 3year period we will have somewhere between 3 and 5 million people dead or dying from aids actually dead or dying from aids that includes those who will be iying up to that time but we will see 3 to 5 million people dead or dying and we will see another 14 million carriers that is by 1995 to 1998 that is 7 to 10 years from right now if we do not start testing by 1991 it is irresponsible to not start a testing program they went on to say in another part of their book there is even more skepticism about the aids virus being transmitted by kissing here again there is no question that this route of transmission is possible the aids virus has been isolated repeatedly from saliva other sexually transmitted diseases including genital herpes and syphilis can be spread in this manner and the point just raised about the common existence of cuts scratches or abrasions on the lips or in the mouth is applicable particularly in terms of soul or french kissing we all know what french kissing is the fact of the matter is that there are 230 million aids viruses that will fit on a period at the end of a sentence the next time you read your newspaper look at the period at the end of the sentence and visualize 230 million aids viruses sitting on that period because that is how many will fit on that it is a very very small virus if somebody has a cut in their mouth and someone kisses them and has that virus in their bodily fluids and their saliva their tears and every other fluid in their body there is a risk that the virus can be transmitted that way and the people can be infected there is no question about that it is a real possibility they went on to say those who prefer to believe that the virus cant be spread by kissing cite two facts to make their case the first is that the virus is present in lower concentrations in saliva in semen or blood which certainly appears to be true based on the relatively crude studies that have been done to date however there is probably enough live virus present to infect another person the second fact also true in a limited sense but of dubious comfort is that so far no one has identified a case of aids in which kissing was the deftnite means of transmission yet this is just another instance in which the inability to experiment in a carefully controlled way creates confusion now 230 million aids viruses sit on the end of a sentence in a period in your kisses your tears saliva every bodily fluid would you want to kiss somebody if you just brushed your teeth if you had a sore in your mouth and you knew they had aids of course not so the risk is there we need to do testing to verify not only this mode of transmission but every other mode of transmission it seems strange to have to raise such an obvious point but if there are lingering uncertainties about the transmission of a deadly infection shouldnt we be adopting precautions against the worstcase possibility rather than making the most optimistic assumption and yet the medicalscientific community has given the public a rather reassuring assessment suggesting that kissing is not apt to be a means of spreading the aids virus this raises the question of whether the intention is to inform people of the relevant risks or to take the path of least resistance stressing only the proven dangers and virtually ignoring those that are possible but not yet thoroughly documented in other words since we cannot prove it we know it is a possibility we will just say it does not exist that is ridiculous the findings as i said before involved 800 sexually active heterosexual adults between the ages of 21 and 40 who all met three criteria no blood transfusions received from 1977 on no use of illicit drugs by injection no homosexual or bisexual contact fron 1977 on these 800 adults consisted of the following groups 200 men and 200 women who reported having been in longterm monogamous relationships either marriage or cohabitation for at least 5 years prior to the time of being interviewed 200 men and 200 women who reported a minimum of six sexual partners a year over the preceding five years regardless of whether they were married it was important to do testing in several different regions thus we decided to conduct our study in four large cities two of whichnew york and los angeleswere considered high risk areas for aids and two of whichst louis and atlantawere not now when they tested those people as i said before only one person out of the 400 who were involved in a monogamous relationship had the aids virus whereas there were numerous cases of those who had multiple sex partners having the aids virus and these were all people not in highrisk groups groups that were believed not to be highrisk prior to this study one other aspect of this study should be noted the population we studied consisted mainly of ordinary generally unremarkable middleclass men and women in their twenties and thirtiesincluding teachers repairmen lawyers secretaries accountants salesmen waitresses students house painters musicians corporate executives and some who were unemployed in particular we must point out that the 400 individuals who reported having sex with relatively large numbers of partners are not nymphomaniacs and satyrs by and large they are single men and women who regard their sexuality as a healthy and fulfilling part of their lives said one 15year old female graduate student i got started with a pretty active sex life when i was 15 and its an important part of my life and she went on i will not go into the rest of that the average number of sex partners in our nonmonogamous group was 11 5 for the women 9 8 for the men approximately onequarter of the women and onefifth of the men in the study group averaged at least 15 different sex partners each year the average annual number of sex partners in the monogamous group by definition was one just the wife or the husband or whoever they were living with the prevalence of infection with the aids virus among the 400 strictly monogamous men and women was not surprisingly very low only one out of the 400 or 0 25 percent we have talked about genital herpes in this country commencing 10 or 15 years ago that is herpes simplex ii we informed our population about the dangers of getting genital herpes ii because it is something that one has the rest of his or her life it never leaves and it flares up from time to time many people have genital herpes ii according to a study conducted last year 40 million americans have herpes simplex ii one out of every six americans has genital herpes ii according to the study yet we have been educating people for 15 years about it and it is still spreading if that same thing happens with the aids virus we are going to have millions and millions and millions of people dying and it will endanger our entire civilization we cannot allow that to go on by itself education will not solve the problem it has not in the past and it will not in the future the somewhat shocking conclusion we have reached is this the aids virus has certainly established a beachhead in the ranks of heterosexuals and because heterosexuals who have large numbers of sexual partners are most likely to be infected with the aids virus the odds are that the rate of spread among heterosexuals will now begin to escalate at a frightening pace in the case of our study for example if each of the 24 infected people in the nonmonogamous group is having sex with 15 others in a year then these 24 people have directly exposed 360 people if each of these 360 people has sexual contact with five additional partners an additional 1 800 persons will have been potentially exposed the prevalence of infection with the aids virus among the 400 strictly monogamous men and women was not surprisingly very low only i out of the 400 or 0 25 percent had evidence of such an infection in contrast the prevalence of infection with the aids virus among the 400 men and women with numerous sexual partners was strikingly higher 14 women 7 percent and 10 men 5 percent among the subgroup of nonmonogamous persons who averaged more than 12 partners annually the prevalence of infection with the aids virus was even higher 14 percent for women 12 percent for men among all the nonmonogamous persons the highest percentage of seropositive study subjects was found in the new york area and the los angeles area 6 percent of the men 8 percent of the women one of the most alarming findings in our studyand one that may surprise many peopleis that less than 10 percent of the men and women who had numerous sex partners each year thought they might be exposing themselves to infection with the i 783 aids virus most were convinced that aids was not a problem among heterosexuals this lack of concern also is expressed in the minimal degree of change in their annual number of sex partners from 1982 to 1986 such nonchalance might have been understandable in 1983 when the epidemic was in its early stages but the persistence of this attitude in 1987 strongly suggests that public health authorities have failed to impress the general public with the message that aids has broken out this in turn creates new concerns first that the rate of iiiv infection will continue to climb relatively unchecked and second that repeated warnings do not by themselves necessarily result in behavioral changes the somewhat chilling conclusion we have reached is this the aids virus has certainly established a beachhead in the ranks of heterosexuals and because heterosexuals who have large numbers of sex partners are most likely to be infected the odds are that the rate of spread among heterosexuals will now begin to escalate at a frightening pace as larger numbers of people are exposed larger numbers of infections are transmitted both sexually and otherwise with timeperhaps with just a few yearsthere will be a trickledown effect in which infection with the aids virus will be commonplace not just in persons who have had many sex partners but in heterosexuals who have had relatively few sex partners in their lives while the infection spreads it will be possible to maintain a certain degree of blind complacency by simply counting and classifying actual cases of aids this will comfort those who use the absence of a great leap in the percentage of aids caies occurring among nondrugusing heterosexuals as proof that the virus is still contained largely in the homosexual bisexual drugusing communities but with a disease that often has a latency period of five years or more from initial infection until definitive diagnosis we are ignoring biological reality if we accept such a proof we are not talking about a disease that is simply an embarrassment or an inconvenience aids so far as we now know is a disease that is invariably fatal and though it has not been determined how many of those infected with the aids virus will eventually come down with aids i might point out at this time that initially people with the aids virus it was thought that only 10 percent of them would be at risk of getting aids and die then it went to 20 percent then 30 percent then 40 percent then 50 percent and now most scientists believe that as high as 70 percent of the people who get the aids virus will ultimately come down with fullblown aids and die some people who believe that the incubation period can last as long as 30 years believe that 100 percent of the people who get the virus ultimately will die of aids or aidsrelated complex aidsrelated complex is a disease that may not be readily related to aids but it is dementia for example may be the best example the aids virus many times when it gets into the body starts attacking brain cells before there is an outward manifestation of the disease of aids so that people suffer from things that look like alzheimers when in fact it is aidsrelated complex and many persons die from that it looks right now as though the percentage will be quite high as others have said the aids epidemic carries the potential for being the great nst national tragedy in human history yet we stand here in this body and see these centers for disease control and department of health and human services people and have our head in a sack and twiddle our thumbs and say that education of the population is the most important thing and when the population has been educated and there has been no discernible change in their sexual behavioral patterns what do we do the venereal disease rate in this country for gonorrhea syphilis and other communicable venereal diseases has not changed 1 percent downward over the past 10 years as a matter of fact it has gone up at a slightly increasing rate all the education so far about genital herpes and aids has not changed the sexual attitudes of the people of this country education by itself is not solving the problem nor will it people look at someone and think that they are healthy looking and they may be carrying that deadly virus that is going to ultimately kill them because of the incubation period so it seems to me and to anyone who really has studied this and thinks about it that the only way we are going to be able to discover whether or not a person has aids is to test them it is clear that we should not have sexual contact with a new person unless one has been tested the only way to protect our civilization and our society as a whole is to have testing that is why masters johnson and kolodny are calling for massive testing and that is why i have as well as many others people at the centers for disease control poohpooh scientific evidence that leads us to the conclusion that testing is absolutely necessary they will say that people who are advocating this have no credentials admittedly i am not a doctor i do not have any credentials for being a doctor but i have been talking to doctors at harvard at research testing and development in lexington qa and i have been talking to dr salzburg at miles city mt and talking to dr mark whiteside and carolyn mccleod at the center for tropical diseases in miami and there is all kinds of evidence that show this disease is transmitted in ways that are not readily apparent testing is the only way to find out how it is being spread these people are in favor of testing it is just not one uninformed person asking for testing but there is a multitude of doctors and scientists who believe ultimately this must be done so if it ultimately must be done why not get on with it now before the cataclysmic experience takes place let us try to nip this aids epidemic in the bud and save as many lives as possible if we wait until 1995 or until the year 2000 to test we will have millions already dead or dying and millions more communicating the disease to others if we start testing by 1990 or 1991 we can start to minimize the impact in the outyears they went on in their book to say thatpeople who consider themselves at risk for hiv infection also often avoid testing because they feel that finding out they are infected wont be helpful after all many of them point out there is no treatment available to eradicate the infection or even to slow its progression furthermore they say discovering youre infected will only complicate your life and cause a good deal of psychological anguish this sort of resignation to fate presents one of the central public health problems of the aids epidemic the hundreds of thousands of carriers of the virus who go on with life as usual oblivious to the possibility of being infected constitute a major vector in the continuing spread of the epidemic they are not just numbers in an epidemiological maze they are men and women who continue to lead sexually active lives many of them exposing multiple partners to the aids virus each year they are people who irresponsibly clinging to their personal excuses for not being tested silently spread slow death to those with whom they couple in erotic abandon in washington dc howard university about a year ago was conducting a study of the prostitutes that worked this city and of the prostitutes that they were testing 50 percent the last i heard were infected with the aids virus 50 percent of those that they tested up to the time that i talked to the person out there at the howard university 50 percent of the prostitutes in this city were infected with the aids virus and yet they are still out there at night on 14th street plying their trade men and women who come to this city and who take advantage if one would want to call it that of the prostitutes who travel up and down that street may go home and kill their wives or their loved ones yet we allow that to go on no testing is mandated why why are the prostitutes down there allowed to ply their trade when we know half of them are infected and yet we do not have testing mandated for them it makes no sense yet we go on they went on to say in short this is a time for considerable caution in sexual conductmost pronounced in terms of choosing a partner prostitutes male homosexuals iv drug abusers males with bisexual experiences and people who have had large numbers of sexual partners are especially risky as sex partners until it can be shown by testing that they are free of hiv infection trusting attitudes should be tempered by the seriousness of the current situation since you cant tell if people are infected with the aids virus by how they look and since you cant really rely on their own recitation of their sexual history you are just being prudent by insisting that someone who wants to get in bed with you accompany you to a clinic for testing first if the current epidemic goes on relatively uncheckedand if there is no major success in the next year in mounting an educational campaign that effectively motivates people to change their sexual behaviorit is quite possible we will eventually see the majority of aids cases in heterosexuals the immense size of the pool of uninfected but potentially atrisk heterosexuals is so much larger than the pool of homosexual and bisexual men that if no way of containing the rate of spread in the general population is found the epidemic will explode in a manner that will make the numbers from 1981 to 1988 seem tame under these circumstances we would expect that by 1993 over a quarter of the new cases of aids will occur in heterosexuals who are not iv drug users by the turn of the century more than half of aids cases will be in the heterosexual population this is what we are facing and yet those at the department of health and human services and at the centers for disease control say that we do not need to test anybody they say that they will figure it out sooner or later how are they going to figure it out how can anyone figure out who has it if there is no testing if people are spreading this disease down on 14th street or people who have the disease having contracted it by being down on 14th street and do not know that they have it and are giving it to other sexual partners how are we going to find out who they are and stop that epidemic from spreading unless we have testing there is no way the argument has been made that the tests are not all that accurate if you give the elisa it shows positive and you test again and if you give it a second time it shows positive but if you go to the western blot test that test is virtually foolproof and if you catch people with an aids false positive that will be followed up by a subsequent test that will verify whether or not it is accurate if it is inaccurate you will find out with the western blot test the army did this test for about 5 and some change per person not everybody has to go through the entire litany of tests some only have to take one but if you average it out over the 2 million service personnel that were tested it was about 5 and some change to test them the same figure could be used to test everybody in this country granted the costs of testing for aids would be probably 11 2 to 3 billion but when you realize that by the mid1990s we are going to be spending probably 10 to 15 times that much to take care of those who are dying from aids it is money well spent we can have as much as 30 to 45 billion being spent annually by the mid1990s to take care of people dying with aids so why shouldnt we spend onetenth of that amount to find out who has it who is spreading it who they are spreading it to how it is being spread there are people in miami dr cloud and dr whiteside the heads of the center for tropical diseases who suggest that it is being spread by mosquitoes and who brought it to the hhs and the hhs doctors were asked what if you had a mosquito with blood with aids hiv in it and the hhs had no reponse and they may be right i do not know we need to find out we need to find out if it is spread by the insect vector we should be testing to see if the testing will show a higher incidence of aids virus in areas like belle glade fl louisiana in the bayou areas and those are things we need to find out and we will not find out unless we get on with the testing program they concluded this article which i read which i am reading to you by saying unless adolescents and young adults can be convinced that the aids virus is a reality in their world now it is unlikely that there will be enough of a shift in behavior to keep this epidemic from expanding at an alarming rate although it makes a nice headline the sexual revolution is not deadit is just that some of the troops are dying and a lot more of them are going to die many of the people in the scientific community poohpooh what masters and johnson reported they used to applaud masters and johnson for their sexual revelations when they wrote their original reports but now they are poohpoohing this report and those who are poohpoohing this report saying they are using hypothetical figures their figures are not hypothetical and their statistical research is pretty accurate as far as i can tell masters johnson and kolodny talk about dr salzburg and dr vernon mark of harvard and the research testing and development center in lexington ga who have been working on the statistical data backing up what these other gentlemen have said and the facts show in my view that we have got a tiger by the tail this is not an epidemic but a pandemic staring us in the face we have to head it off at the pass and the only way to do it is to start off with testing i am open to suggestions and if you want to narrow it down we would be heading in the right direction but to sit back and do nothing would be disastrous dr alan salzburg of miles city mt just sent me an update of his study to the aids pandemic through the year i would like to read to you a little bit about his projections his projections are if we do not test if we go on in the dame cavalier manner we have been going in the last few years by 1995 there will be at least 2 1 million people dead or dying 13 million will probably have it in that particular year and there will be 12 million carriers that is by 1995 by the year 2000 his projections show and these are based not just on his figures he pulled out of the air they are based on studies that have already been conducted cohort studies already conducted in various parts and lie has collectivized those put them in a computer and made these assumptions i think they are accurate they bear out what the cdc has projected through 1995 his figures parallel the death rate that the center for disease control at atlanta has projected through the year 1991 so he is right on target for the next 3 to 4 years but he goes beyond through the year 2005 yet they say his figures are inaccurate i dont believe that is the case he predicts by the year 2000 there will be 6 100 000 americans dead or dying 20 million carriers if we do not start identifying those who are spreading this disease by testing them by the year 2005 his projections of the cumulative number of people dead or dying the cases will be 12 300 000 and 35 million carriers now if he is only 50 percent right or if he is only 25 percent right we have a monumental problem masters and johnson and kolodny have verified pretty much what he has said and other scientists will verify this the scientists and doctors who have done the military research program have tested all

is spreading in a very rapid manner we do not know how widespread it"], [3.226937224098947e-06, 3.226937224098947e-06, 0, "i want todo a special order tonight entitied running from reality the modern democratic left i want to place it in context i first did the research for most of this talk in april 1986 when i took 10 hours of debate in the unitedstates house and analyzed them as a historian trying to understand the rhetorical patterns of the modem left the biggest conclusion i came to is that there is a systematic process by which the modern democratic left ignores the reality of the soviet union and ignores the realityof the world we live in frankly after we finally got done doing the research i put it to one side and did not really think about it very much then recently i read an article about a democrat who said a series of things about central america so fundamentally wrong and so just plain inaccurate that as a history teacher i was intrigued i am not going to quote by name anyone tonight because i have not given anyone notice i am just going to refer to liberal democrats generically but let me quote from one particular democrat this is from cspan the contras are a pure communist group now that is not only wrong it is about as inaccurate as suggesting that the united states bombed pearl harbor it would be almost impossible to responsibly vote in the unitedstates congress on anything if you are notsure who you are voting for yet by definition the contras are the freedom fighters who are on the american side against the communists the gentleman apparently did not have any idea who the contras were although i believe he voted against helping them apparently on the grounds he thought they were the communists second at one time in history most of the states in latin america were communistic that is just not true you can make some argument guyana has leaned communist clearly grenada was communist nicaragua is now communist cuba is communist and that is it argentina chile ecuador peru colombia brazil panama jamaica the list goes on and on most of the countries of south america and central america have never been communist the gentleman was just wrong he went on to say then we had an organization formed thatjust cant recall the name of it now but really showed the value of being a democracy well i am presuming that the reference is to the organization of american states but in fact it was formed largely to defeat nazi germany around 1940 it was not primarily formed for the purpose of dealing with communism it certainly precedes the communist threat to the western hemisphere the organization of american states has a long and noble tradition of being what it says an organization of american states he went on to say there are three different groups down there who form the contras one is controlled by a man named uno the other is controlled by awell i dont recall their names uno is in fact the initials uno for the organization which is one of the freedom fighter groups it is not the name of a man finally i dont think the country of nicaragua has enough firepower in the navy or the air force or their army to fight anybody now that is just explicitly systematically wrong the nicaraguan military the communist nicaraguan military is the most powerful military force in central america so what do we have here this is what intrigued me and led me to decide to do this evenings special order here we have a leftwing democratic congressman who thinks the contras are the communists who thinks most of the countries of latin america are communist who thinks that there is a man who is in fact an organization and who thinks nicaragua does not have an army navy or air force to confront anyone i would suggest based on those factually wrong statements that the gentlemans vote is perfectly correct if in fact the fantasy world he just described existed he should vote for the leftwing democratic proposal to unilaterally surrender in central america but in fact it is not correct i was not intrigued with this passion for leftwing democrats to be factually wrong about foreign policy that i went back and i reexamined the paper i had written a year ago based on the debate in march 1986 i was struck with the old french proverb the more things change the more they remain the same as i go through this analysis which i hope to upgrade in a couple of weeks with todays debate notice how relevant this yearold analysis remains notice how little the democratic left has learned about reality notice how if you do not know anything about the world and you do not understand the factual information and you are not sure what the soviet union is and you are not sure who the contras are and you cannot quite figure out how wellarmed nicaragua is you can suddenly understand much of modern leftwing democratic foreign policy because it combines two continuing facts first it lives in a fantasy world driven by a psychological commitment to avoid reality and second it is simply ignoranti mean the word ignorant as a college teacherliterally does not know what it is talking about i noticed recently for example a leading democrat who is a subcommittee chairman on the committee on foreign affairs was quoted as saying that he had always agreed with the communist party in its commitment to free speech i would suggest to you that anyone who thinks that the communist party believes in free speech ought to vote in favor of coexistence with a group which after all believes in free speech i would also suggest that you have to deny the entire history of the soviet union since 1917 the entire history of cuba since 1960 the entire history of the soviet empire in eastern europe the entire history of what is going on in nicaragua and if you deny all of that and reject all of that factual information then you can convince yourself of the fantasy which the democratic left believes in i might suggest by the way that timothy ashbys fine new book the bear in the backyard moscows caribbean strategy which is just out is something that any member who wants to begin to understand what is happening in central and south america and the caribbean should read ashby goes step by step what is the historical soviet interest in latin america and the caribbean what is cubas role as a colony of the soviet empire how is cuba used as a base for soviet power projections what was the role of grenada and what was grenada doing what is the role of nicaragua and soviet strategy for the caribbean what is happening in el salvador and honduras what is happening in jamaica guiana and surinam how does all this fit together timothy ashbys book ought to be required reading for every leftwing democrat before they are allowed to vote again when you read this the other much thicker book which is the grenada documents published by the unitedstates state department which ought to be required reading for every leftwing democrat because when you read the documents that talk about reality it begins to be obvious just how out of touch with the real world the democrats are let me put it in context the threat of communism in nicaragua can only be understood within the context of the soviet empire the soviet use the communist cuban colonial troops the historic patterns in which leninist factions seize power and ally themselves with the soviet union is the primary threat to the survival of the united states the modern democratic left ignores the reality of the soviet empire it does not understand the role of castros cuba and by interpreting history in its own distorted way it denies the seriousness of leninism as a doctrine for imposing tyranny finally it is blind to the predictability of communist behavior consequently the modern democratic left sees no threat to the united states from the soviet empire modern leftwing democrats truly believe and are intensely committed to their ideology they are committed though on an emotional level not an intellectual level their rejection of certain factual data is a sign of cognitive dissonance a psychological condition not factual disagreement an intellectual condition we will not cure the modern leftwing democrats of this condition thus taking them seriously and debating them intellectually is a mistake it legitimizes their fantasy world as accepting their position as even defensible is anything but a fantasy therefore we must isolate the modern democratic left our challenge is to convince younger americans who are untramatized by vietnam and who are willing and capable of looking reality in the face our strategy must be to highlight the democratic lefts fantasy world and contrast it with the grim reality of the world we see on the evening news let me make this very clear consistently if you read leftwing democratic speeches about the world and you watch the evening news the world on the evening news is tougher more dangerous and more brutal than the fantasies of leftwing democrats they cannot explain terrorism in lebanon they cannot explain the soviet army in afghanistan they cannot explain the massive increase of cuban and soviet forces in a colonial communist nicaragua our goal has to be to convince the american people that the survival of honest people depends on honest realism no matter how repugnant reality may be democracy can only survive if the people of that democracy are told the truth and are led to face tough choices in an honest realistic way success will be found in discrediting the democratic left as thoroughly as isolationism was discredited in bipartisan fashion between 1946 and 1952 victory will be a bipartisan consensus that the soviet empire is dangerous we must go beyond that and build a successful strategy for transnational survival and the strengthening of freedom let me start with the debate of march 19 and 20 1986 the march 1986 house of representatives debate on president reagans proposal to aid nicaraguan freedom fighters is a case study in the political and intellectual divisions which have undermined americas effectiveness in stopping communism for the past 20 years a careful study of the 136 pages in the march 19 and 20 1986 congressional record covering the 10 hours of debate will reveal a leftwing world view which simply prevents intellectual debate on foreign policy the average citizen would find it difficult to understand what is happening in the debate due to the passion with which the left advocates their world view fantasy since many leftwing politicians have excellent educations and are able to use english brilliantly they can cloak their delusions and fantasies in pseudolearning to the unknowing listener their arguments sound plausible sometimes one hears an occasional phrase or concept that seems to be in touch with common sense and reality the extent of intellectual blindness and psychological delusion among the modern democratic left is obvious some members used emotional statements irrational arguments distortions of history and false facts to make seemingly intellectual points in the debate consider the following patterns in the march 19 and 20 house debate of last year nineteen representatives found some way to blame america for the rise of communism in nicaragua ten blamed the united states for forcing the nicaraguan communists to be repressive as if communists are not always repressive four said that president reagan if he is really worried about communism in our hemisphere should go after cuba and the soviet union twelve suggested that violence never works they ignore the fact that it was violence that brought castro and ortega to power in the first place and violence which was the only thing that worked against hitler seven suggested we should never aid freedom fighters against a government that we diplomatically recognize yet these same seven support a similar policy in afghanistan where we support the guerrillas against a government that we do recognize fifteen scoffed at nicaragua as a threat by simply ignoring the soviet and cuban elements of the communist regime six applied guidelines to united states behavior which if applied in afghanistan would mean an end to all aid to the afghan freedom fighters this happened again by the way today if we had a moratorium on aid to the afghan freedom fighters until all the aid was audited we would simply cut off the aid it is fascinating to me that no one on the left has proposed a moratorium on aid to the ethiopian communist government a prosoviet dictatorship no one has suggested that we should not send them the american taxpayers dollars until we audit the communists but those on the democratic left were very confortable in suggesting that we cut off aid to the freedom fighters who were proamerican last year 33 confidently asserted the freedom fighters could not win even with the aid some of these were members who 16 years ago predicted peace and freedom in cambodia and vietnam if only we would cut off aid but we got the peace and freedom of slavery and of death twentysix wrongly analyzed the nicaraguan communists by ignoring the leninistcommunistsoviet system of tyranny that is they described nicaragua as though it was a democracy or as though it was somehow just a group of guys who liked designer sunglasses but were basically reasonable people they ignored all we have learned over the last 70 years about the nature of a leninistsoviet state and all we learned from the grenada documents about the way the cubans train secret police and organize dictatorships last year 16 suggested america could not afford to send 100 million to the freedom fighters yet they consistently vote for more spending on virtually everything else in the budget in fact 15 of them last year voted for increasing the number of automatic elevator operators for congress in other words there was as much money as we need for more automatic elevator operators to run elevators which will run automatically if you push a button but not a dime more to defend freedom in central america two who have consistently voted against president reagans central american policy and helped defeat many of his requests piously asserted that reagan had gotten everything he asked for in central america over the last 5 years again we saw this pattern today on the one hand leftwing democrats do everything they can to block every kind of rational policy from a conservative standpoint in central america on the other hand they blame reagan because congress has tied his hands and made it impossible to have an effective policy two suggested the president should declare war on nicaragua as an alternative to aiding the freedom fighters seventeen suggested we should use american troops if the nicaraguan communists are a threat to american security and i might point out that as recently as today one of the leadoff leftwing democratic speakers suggested that if we really have a problem in central america let us use american troops but vote not to send money to help the freedom fighters i find it a little bizarre that the correct answer is that american troops should go and fight but the local people who are willing to fight for themselves should not be helped last year five leftwing democrats predicted that a yes vote would lead to escalation and nicaraguan communist attacks into honduras none of them would accept that defeating the aid would lead to what really happened which was in fact that 1 000 nicaraguan communists invadedhonduras 2 days after aid was at that point defeated eighteen who opposed the aid did so because they perceived the threat of mccarthyism they mistook attacks on their record and judgment for attacks on their patriotism and security several bitterly resented any suggestion that their no vote would lower freedom fighter morale and thereby encourage communist aggression an extreme example of the lefts isolation and fear of reality was a particularly odd request by one democrat after representative bob walker had spoken the democrat protestedand i quote i request the gentlemans words be taken down he is questioning the judgment of other members of this house the democrat continued he questions the judgment of the members of the house who oppose the reagan proposition when asked if he insisted on his request he continued yes i do because it followed a statement that i just made when i indicated that i oppose the presidents position and certainly by inference he is questioning my judgment and i resent it that is found on page 1212 on 0l 2010 now i would suggest if you look at that that this incident illustrates the degree to which the left now confuses its belief system with moral righteousness and its judgment with patriotism to question the democratic lefts record is perceived by the left as an assault on their motives to question the results of their policies is seen by the left as a smear on their patriotism notice that the man was complaining because what was being questioned was and again i quote the words his judgment but of course in a debate that is what you question if we thought the judgment was sound we would vote with him it is precisely because we think the lefts judgment is so bad that we are systematically suggesting that there is a gap between reality and their view of the world the fact is from a historical standpoint while meaning well the american left has performed badly unable to accept the responsibility of 20 years of failure they deny their guilt the democratic left has been wrong about communism their actions made it easier for the communist dictatorship to thrive in vietnam they have accepted communist massacres in cambodia they ignore communist colonies imposed on angola and mozambique they condone communist savagery imposed on ethiopia and now they facilitate the current communist regime in nicaragua the results of their policies are refugees from southeast asia vietnamese and cuban boat people the desperate appeals of freedom fighters the living testimony of solzhenitsyn shcharansky and sakharov and the cries of refuseniks and dissidents throughout the soviet empire it is little wonder that the democratic left finds it easier to hide in a pleasant fantasy world they blame america first and seek unrealistic solutions which will somehow allow america to live comfortably with the soviet empire and its military bases in our backyard let me quote for just a moment from ed feulners introduction to timothy ashbys the bear in the backyardmoscows caribbean strategy dr feuner the head of the heritage foundation says and i quote what zbigniew brzezinski has described as a fourth central strategic front in the worldwide unitedstates soviet contest has opened in the caribbean and central america never before in history has the unitedstates been faced with a national security threat of such proportions so close to its borders what would have been unthinkable to americans a generation ago has become reality the soviet union a rival superpower unprecedented in aggressiveness and strategic capability has established a major military espionage political and cultural presence in the united states backyard having tested and found wanting the unitedstates resolve in protecting its vital caribbean interests the kremlin has declared the monroe doctrine dead dr feulner and timothy ashby in fact put their finger on a key point what we should have been debating in this house today was whether or not we would act to somehow move the soviet union out of cuba to make sure the soviet union left nicaragua to reestablish american security in our own backyard instead the modem democratic left consistently trivializes the issues afraid to face up to the big tough realities they create tiny fantasies afraid to deal with the soviet empire they create small issues unwilling to deal with literally thousands of soviet colonial troops in cuba and thousands of cuban colonial troops in nicaragua they instead propose that we have cpas and accountants who will magically cure americas problems in the world it is impossible to have a rational debate with these deluded ideologues this 10 hours of talking past each other proves we need a new approach to discussing foreign policy the key to a successful dialog on americas survival and the survival of freedom is to recognize that the american left can be defined and exposed but it cannot be debated we must reach beyond them to have a dialogue with the american peoplethrough the news mediaso they can learn and choose the worldview and solutions they agree with since modern leftwing democrats live in a fantasy world true debate is impossible after all watching a debate about medicine between two doctors is one experience watching a debate between a doctor and an alcoholic masquerading as a doctor so he can prescribe whiskey is a totally different proposition the american left replaces fact with fantasy reality with rhetoric and security with sentiment we are at the end of a 20year foreign policy debate dominated by left wing language and assumptions for 20 years congressional subcommittees in which leftwing democrats have held very powerful positions have shaped our foreign policy consequently their policies have been implemented by bureaucracies weakened and made ineffective by two decades of american military and diplomatic decay and withdrawal from the real world because the vision defines and determines tactics we must create the new consensus in american foreign policy at the vision level first the specific tactical victories will follow president harry truman convinced america there was a soviet empire and that it threatened america only then he won the vote on aid to greece and turkey he could not have done it in reverse order where are we today and how did we get here let me start with the basics and this is frankly not believeable to many of leftwing friends because they simply reject this reality there is a soviet communist empire the soviet empire is based on the writings of lenin it maintains and explains its power and control over its people and its colonies through the communist party the secret police and the military the soviet empires grasp reaches to east germany poland czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria syria libya the plo south yemen ethiopia angola mozambique from the arctic to afghanistan the soviet empire continues to expand its grasp by using communist cuban colonial troops it dominates the mouth of the red sea it has a major presence in the mediterranean it has bases on both the indian and atlantic coasts of southern africa western pacific the caribbean and the pacific coast of north america if you accept that the soviet empire is a threat and if you also accept that its allies are part of the empire then you have to accept that the allies of the soviets are a threat the nicaraguan communists promised the united states and the organization of american states it would quickly hold free elections thereby gaining vital support in their effort to overthrow somoza however since taking power the nicaraguan communists have suppressed true nicaraguan democrats and imposed a cubanstyle communist dictatorship the nicaraguan communists followed the leninistsoviet doctrine quite well they are doing precisely what they should to cement their alliance with the soviets and cubans against freedom and the united states the lesson of 26 years of communism in cuba should be clear castro has consolidated power and trained terrorists and guerrillas who subvert free countries cuba votes against israel and the united states in the un it provides colonial troops for the soviets to use against israel and the third world it provides a base for soviet spying against the united states it threatens its neighbors with subversion and now cuba is training the nicaraguan communists to be as antiamerican and prosoviet as their cuban comrades a sovietcuba foothold on the north american continent is a threat to the united states because it gives the soviets additional bases in our own backyard it imposes communism on people who want to be free it also increases the resources and power of the soviet empire at the time when it would otherwise be decaying rapidly the rebellion of free nicaraguans against communist dictatorship is part of a worldwide rebirth of freedom in defiance of the soviet empire and communism in afghanistan cambodia ethiopia angola and nicaragua communist dictatorships and their soviet and cuban colonial enforcers are being challenged by nationalist groups determined to free their nations both our own security as americans and our moral hertiage beginning with the declaration of independence compel us to recognize the threat of the soviet empire and our responsibility of aiding freedom fighters i must say to stand in a house which has george washingtons portrait and lafayettes portrait and hear leftwing democrats talk about getting accountants to audit the books of guerrilla fighters who are fighting for freedom is almost enough to make one despair can you imagine if the french had had people as foolish as leftwing democrats who said send no money to george washington at valley forge do nothing to help benjamin franklin after all we have not audited the american account can you imagine what would have happended to our revolution for freedom if in fact cpas had been called in by the french king who said oh we cannot do anything to help freedom until we audit thomas jefferson it is madness it is absolutely irrational it is precisely the fantasy world of the modern left which ignores history and is certainly not worthy of either washingtons portrait or lafayettes portrait"], [3.3646804240561323e-06,

development subcommittee and then by the full committee on public works and transportation and subsequently time after time by bipartisan votes in this chamber has made the necessary improvements to make this program a workable viable program that addresses the critical need in america the need for jobs in america the need is for jobs to solve that urgent and most pressing problem the problem of

welfare by its very nature is often degrading frustrating embarrassing and people basically do not want to be on welfare nonetheless the welfare system is a necessity i know of no welfare recipient who wants to stay on welfare perhaps there is a very very small element that seems to be so helpless that there is no alternative but by and large people want to get off of it i think this debate is encouraging because both sides today are saying that we ought to take a different approach i believe there is agreement that we ought to have a system of training and some kind of workfare rather than welfare i do not know anybody who wants to continue the same expensive program we have it seems like we are locked into further expense as we go along so we are in agreement we ought to have a different approach i do not accuse anyone of saying they do not want to have reform i think they act in good faith we have a good choice here a good alternative i believe the bill the committee has put together is a positive progressive step and we ought to take that chance we ought to say we can do better than we are doing today so with good faith i hope the house can support this welfare

of this measure because the right to participate in the political process should be restored for these citizens the hatch act has denied federal employees political rights for 48 years and it is now time to change this outdated notion we must give the 2 5 million federal and postal employees the right to participate in the political processes of the government that employs them of particular

to compete in a world market to do that we need research and development what we have done in this bill is to develop research and to try to fund in a very modest way innovative technology in a lot of fields recognizing that energy is central in terms of the ability of an economic industrial nation to compete in the world marketplace in this particular case we are talking about research and development at a university some of these things are at universities i would point out that the value of this to a society is best exemplified in massachusetts by virtue of the fact that mit is there

american consumer apparently not content with taxing american consumers at the rate of 27 billion a year the industry wants an additional 25 to 27 billion over the next 5 years according to the chairman of the council of economic advisers the bill will increase the cost of living of every family in the country by 280 to 420 over the next 5 years surely the time has come to say enough is enough lets look at how this bill hurts our constituents first as a result of the restrictions that will be imposed many products simply will no longer be available domestic manufacturers either cannot or will not be able to fill this void i understand that the availability of lower priced childrens wear and budget department items in particular will be substantially reduced second as foreign manufacturers change their product mix to adjust to the new quota limits they will increasingly concentrate on producing higher priced items as a result many lower priced items will not be available and those that will be available will cost much more that will hit our poorest constituents hardest finally reduced supply and higher prices will generate inflationary pressures in the past year alone import prices have increased substantially as the market has felt the full force of recently imposed quotas enactment of h r 1154 will only compound the problem ive heard it said that consumers wont suffer allegedly its the retail community that profits at the expense of consumers by buying foreign goods nothing could be further from the truth retailing is one of the most fiercely competitive industries we have in the united states price is dictated by consumers no retailer can afford to try and make an extra buck in the way proponents of this legislation assert indeed a study prepared for the domestic industry in 1984 showed that there is little difference in the actual profit earned on domestic and imported womens sweaters in fact retailers often found domestic sweaters more
