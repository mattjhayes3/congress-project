{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "we are i hope nearing the end of the first session of the 106th congress and there are some people who say that probably the end of october we might end the session but from what i hear today it may be close to thanksgiving before we get out of here either way it is a most regrettable session it is a tragic comedy that ought to end as soon as possible one of the most regretful parts of this session is that the republican majority that is in charge of the congress is not listening to the american people we as politicians always are accused of holding our fingers in the air to see which way the wind is blowing and shaping our actions and our policies in accordance with public opinion it is very interesting that this is a year when in very important areas we are not listening to the people when we should be i am not saying that we should always follow public opinion i think a representative government means that they expect some judgment to be exercised by those who are elected and sometimes their conscience and their knowledge and their vision may conflict with the opinion of the masses but in general we should always be listening and when there is a conflict we should certainly try to work towards some kind of compromise some kind of merging of our own opinions with those of the majority we pay a lot of money for polls and both parties and individuals rely heavily on focus groups and all kinds of devices to find out what people are thinking but we have a situation now where it is quite clear on several major issues exactly where people are where the majority is and this republican majority refuses to listen of course i am told that if the republican majority wants to shipwreck that first session of the 106th congress or maybe the next session too and we come to a situation where their conflict with the majority of americans is so great until the democratic process will gointo action and it will throw them out of office we should not worry as democrats we should be happy that there is such confusion and such daytoday trivializing of the processes of the congress everyday we have stupid bills that really do not mean very much and are a waste of time in our committees instead of meeting issues head on we are dancing around them and camouflaging the real intent of the majority on these bills currently we have a situation of that kind in the committee on education and the workforce as we seek to reauthorize the title i portion of the elementary and secondary education assistance act i am sure many other committees are finding the same tactics where we do not address reality we trivialize the process by playing around the edges and we are proud of not doing anything this is a nocommitment congress some people have often used the joke that when congress is out of session the republicans say it is good for us not to be around because we only do harm when we are here well i think that worse than doing harm is to not address the issues at hand and to do nothing sins of omission are the sins of the 106th congress it is a shipwreck congress as we come closer to the close of this first year it seems that matters are growing worse each day not better we might say that maybe we had a high point last week where we did vote on the hmo patients bill of rights the patients bill of rights that would allow people to have some kind of leveraging as they deal with the health maintenance organizations well we finally came to a point where we got a vote on the floor we got a long debate and there were attempts to poison the bill with substitutes and even now there are attachments to the bill which place the hmo patients bill of rights bill in some jeopardy but at least it has been accomplished finally but what took so long when so many americans have made it quite clear that they wanted something done about reining in the hmos they wanted this patients bill of rights very badly do we always have to reach the point where 80 percent of the people are for something before we can get some action by the republican majority here in the house why must it take 80 percent before they realize that there are political dangers in not doing anything so finally they yielded and we were able to get a patients bill of rights flawed as it may be passed out of the house and it is now going into the conference process with the other body and the other body has a bill which is quite different and weaker and we must watch closely to see that the patients bill of rights the heart of the matter is not sabotaged and rendered impotent it is very important that with all of the kinds of experiences that we now have all of the anecdotes that can be told on either side both republicans and democrats if one is a congressperson one is constantly being assailed with stories of the hmos and our failure to do anything to combat the abuses that hmos are guilty of so it is something that had to be done the focus groups told us the polls told us but it took us a long time to get there i am happy to see that in certain places there is movement ahead of the congress and we will have to run to catch up but i think that there issuch a strong impetus to have justice in the area of health care that we are going to get it by and by it just takes too long the democratic process should not take so long i understand that california in california today or yesterday the governor signed a bill where california now has a standard a fixed standard for nurse and patient ratios in nursing homes and hospitals we have to have a certain number of nurses in ratio to the patients that is reasonable so that the patients will get a reasonable amount of care governor gray davis democratic governor of california signed that bill i want to congratulate the people of california congratulate the legislators out there for moving forward on correcting a major abuse that hmos have caused as a pressure to bring down the cost of health care the amount of money that they pay the hospitals for health care they have forced hospitals into situations where they have cut back on personnel often personnel that is vital to the health and safety of the patients 0 2130 we should not tolerate that there are elements in the norwooddingell bill which deal with standards deal with protection access to services emergency care a number of very direct approaches which rein in abuses that are known to have been practiced by the health maintenance organizations most important in the norwooddingell bill is the provision for the suing of hmos we can take an ijmo to court and sue which nobody is recommending a large number of court suits but if the power to sue is there then it establishes a whole different environment that patients operate in and it is very important to keep that provision in there so we can applaud that finally after begging after pleading after pushing after the public opinion polls kept rising we were able to get some action on the floor we have a bill that is going through a process now which has to be watched closely but i hope it is progressing the fact that the house and senate now have to go into conference and come out with a bill that both houses can live with and the president will sign is a good sign we are much further along than we were i assure the members before we passed that bill last thursday prescription drug benefits are not dealt with in this bill this is to deal with reining in hmos there are some items in there related to prescriptions and how hmos must handle prescriptions there are some efforts to cut abuses by health maintenance organizations in the case of prescriptions but we have not addressed the issue of providing prescription drug benefits for people who are on medicare there is a need to be able to let every american share the benefits of modern science there is a need to be able to make certain that no person goes sick or is in pain unnecessarily if we have the drugs if we have the medication which can ease pain can improve health then the factthat a person has no money should not be a barrier to the use of those modern miracle drugs i think that there are some situations where various ailments or diseases are quite rare and unusual and the production of the drugs and medications necessary to treat them is very costly they deserve special treatment but there are a large number of drugs which are designed to deal with commonplace ailments diabetes is an ailment which afflicts millions of americans there are medications for diabetes which everybody should be able to have access to some of them are a bit expensive and expensive is a relative term if a widow is on a small pension and social security and has to pay her rent and food et cetera what is expensive to that widow might seem rather inexpensive to some others of us who are healthy and still working and have good salaries but why should the person who needs it most and the people who are most frail who are the eldest people the people who have declining incomes in many cases or no incomes do without in too many instances i have had people tell me i could not keep taking my medication i could not maintain the drugs that i needed because i just did not have the money it was a matter of either i eat or i take my medications and i had to stay alive some of those same people we do not find them around after a few months because the drugs they take are vital to their health or they become much sicker as a result of not being able to take drugs that are beneficial to the prevention or the retardation of certain kinds of advancing ailments so they get very stck they go the hospitals and they are charity cases they must be taken care of in a much more expensive setting than would be the case if they were allowed to have prescription drugs i am on several prescription drug bills i am happy to say that we have colleagues who have proposed remedies and the president has certainly proposed an initiative that will begin to deal with the problem of the denial of prescription drugs to persons who are in need of these drugs i am on a bill that the gentleman from massachusetts has to require the secretary of health and human services to submit to congress a plan to include as a benefit under the medicare program coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and to provide funding for that benefit i am on another bill that the gentleman from new york has which is a bill to amend title 18 of the social security act to provide for the coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under part b of the medicare program the gentleman from maryland has a bill i am certainly on a bill with our colleague the gentleman from washington in his bill of course he covers all prescription drugs because that is a singlepayer bill h r 1200 i just want to take this opportunity to say that h r 1200 the singlepayer bill sponsored by the gentleman from washington is still very much alive as a piece of legislation we continue to reintroduce it i am on that bill i am on a bill with the gentleman from rhode island with the gentleman from vermont a bill to require persons who undertake federallyfunded research in developmental drugs to enter into reasonable pricing agreements with the secretary of health and human services and for other purposes some might have seen some of these exposes that have appeared on television in the last few months of what the drug situation is with respect to the united states as a principal creator and manufacturer of modern drugs we have a situation where we are charging our citizens far more for those drugs that are created in this country than citizens of other countries are being charged we do not have to go all the way to europe just go next door to canada or next door to mexico and we will see tremendous price differences between the drugs important prescription drugs that are being sold in canada and in mexico versus the price we pay here many of these same drugs have been developed as a result of basic biology and chemistry research that has been done in american universities financed by the taxpayers of the country and have been done in our institutes of health there are studies and all kinds of things we do to enhance the production of important modern drugs but we are as citizens forced to pay enormous prices far more than people in other countries this is unacceptable this is a reason to get angry we cannot dawdle here in the congress and let this continue to go on we need to come to grips with the fact that our people our citizens who in many cases have financed partially financed the development of important modern drugs are being charged enormously excessive rates for the use of those drugs that is more unfinished business the public says they want something done about this the polls say we need to do something about it the people have spoken but nobody is listening the republican majority is not listening to the american people some folks in new york state for example have made a joke out of the fact that the first lady hillary clinton is considering running exploring a possible run for the senate she has announced for several months now that she is on a listening tour she is not running she is on a listening tour they made fun of that and thought it was very funny that it is a new twist and people like to play with it but i think it is a very good idea to have every american elected official start out by listening it is a very important part of our activity we pay a lot to get to the point where people are talking to us through our polling through our focus groups it is a vital part of the operation no political campaign goes forward without polls and without attempting to measure the opinion of the public so we know that they want prescription drug benefits we know they want a bill of rights for health maintenance organization patients we know this very well so why is the republican majority refusing to listen to the american people we have some areas where the public has no opinion or no particular concern where there is a great deal of activity here in washington to spend their money to spend the taxpayers money the other side likes to talk about taxpayers money being wasted on food stamps and wic programs and medicare and programs that benefit people but they are very much involved in the effort to revive the f22 the f22 is an airplane that may be a miracle airplane it may be able to do all the things one day when they get through with the research and testing the f22 may be a miracle airplane able to do wonders but it costs billions of dollars to manufacture f22s they are trying to work out a situation where they can get it through the testing stage and we will build 50 to 60 billion worth 6f f22s why do we need 50 to 60 billion worth of f22 fighter planes when we have very good planes that are far superior to any planes manufactured anywhere in the world why do we need another super super fighter plane but there is a great deal of discussion underway about what can be done to save the f22 how can we develop a rationale to spend billions of dollars to develop this plane that is manufactured mostly in marietta georgia the home district of our former speaker of the house of representatives mr gingrich what can we do to revive the f22 the public is not asking for the f22 in no poll no focus groups will we hear people crying for more f22s i marvel at the way the majority the republican majority gets stuck and stays in one rut i was looking through my records and found that on march 14 of 1995 that is 4 years ago more than 4 years ago i commented on the f22 and the folly of pursuing money for the f22 at a time when the republican majority was proposing to save money by cutting back on school lunches i think about a month later in april i talked about the nation needs your lunch where the republican majority was saying to schoolkids we have a budget crunch we need your lunch we have to cut back on school lunches in order to make certain that we balance the budget that same republican majority was at that time very much pushing the f22 i am going to go back and read from march 14 1995 what i said i would like to make one more plea for justice i want to again beg the leadership of this congress to abandon its reckless demolition of the programs that have helped to make america great in the eyes of the whole civilized world the way we as a nation have treated the least among us is the vital ingredient of our greatness this is a plea for honest decisionmaking yes there is waste in government and it must be removed but school lunches and summer youth employment programs are not wasteful these are the government programs that work these are the programs that are still very much needed the cia is not needed at the level of 28 billion a year which they admtitted was at least that much in 1995 the farm price supports for rich farmers are no longer needed at the level of 16 billion a year we do not need another sea wolf submarine and we certainly do not need to spend billions of dollars for f22 fighter planes the f22 enterprise in marietta georgia represents a longterm overwhelming pork barrel for this same amount of money we could double the number of jobs in the civilian sector creating infrastructure and services that are needed the f22 is republican pork in the federal budget this is a huge hog that deserves to be slaughtered my point is that the f22 in 1995 was on no list of public opinion at a high level demanding that we build f22s in 1999 it is even less desirable than it was in 1995 yet we are going ahead not listening we are not listening to the public when they say they want a patients bill of rights we are not listening to the public when they say we want prescription drug benefits we are not listening to the public when they say we want school construction an increase in the minimum wage they are not listening but they are trying hard to put together a program to maintain the f22 in 1999 in 1995 i did a little poem for them that went as follows the f22 for pork not for me and you the f22 toys for skies blue empty of any enemy crew the f22 jobs for just a few the f22 rich georgia stew pork pork pork not for me and you off the orphans starve the kids gave the contracts roll out the bids bully the poor be a hightech dog eat the best meat high on the hog for the peach who gives a hoot the f22 pork is now the georgia state fruit pork pork pork where they grow the f22 that is the speakers hometown too the f22 pork pork pork not for me and you 0 2i45 the f22 mostly manufactured in marietta georgia the home of former speaker newt gingrich and there are still people who are working day and night to put together a plan to keep that f22 flowing at the cost of billions of dollars nowhere is the public asking for more f22s we are spending a great deal and amount of time to do the things that nobody wants done except a small special interest few but we are ignoring some other big issues while we dawdle here in this 106th congress and do not pay attention to anything of great importance the era of prosperity and relative peace in the world which has given us time to focus on important vital matters is being whittled away we should be dealing with the fact that in this era of peace we should invest more funds in ways to keep peace going not in f22s and other war machines that are really outdated where is the next contact likely to come from probably between india and pakistan every day some new development takes place way over there between two very highly populated countries that have been at each other for quite awhile mainly over the issue of kashmir the pakistani government was overthrown today there was a coup the elected government elected by a majority of the people was overthrown by the army pakistan has had a long history of military rule and whenever the military rules they only go backward they have a lot of economic problems at this point and they are likely to get worse why is the pakistani army in charge now because the elected prime minister a person chosen by the people decided to dismiss the chief of staff of the army the chief of the armed forces the chief of the armed forces is the person rumored to have caused a major up heaval a few months ago when he marched without the knowledge of his government without the knowledge of the prime minister of the approval of the elected officials that went into kashmir beyond the line of demarcation and caused a crisis with india that blunder is the kind of blunder that could lead to a situation where we would inevitably be drawn in not that we could do much to solve the problem in that place it is not so easy to have a bombing campaign which would bring whoever is right and wrong and it is not clear who is right and who is wrong to the table in that situation there may be two recent nuclear powers i will not say amateur nuclear powers but they certainly are recent there is a recent acquisition recent testing of nuclear bombs if they start throwing bombs at each other then the atmosphere is polluted the winds are blowing who anywhere in the world is going to be safe from the kind of radiation fallout who anywhere in the world will be safe from the kinds of things that would permanently be done to the environment as a result of some kind of even a smallscale nuclear war between pakistan and india so we ought to be studying ways to deal with making peace in the world and pakistan india and kashmir ought to be one of those places that we are focusing attention on we have focused very little of our energy and attention on that region if the same kind of energy and attention that we focus on the middle east was focused on that area we might have gotten close to a solution by now not that we have done too much in the middle east we just need to do as much to deal with the worlds second most populous nation india and a very densely populated nation of pakistan there is a territory called kashmir and it lies between india and pakistan and years ago when i was still in school india promised that it would allow selfdetermination for the people of kashmir that has been on the agenda for all of these years and still no plebiscite no vote has been allowed under the supervision of the united nations or some kind of outside objective observers which would allow the people of kashmir to make a determination as to what they want to do whether they want to become part of india or part of pakistan or become independent i h9888 india says no the focus of the world is on the gunhappy army of pakistan yes that is a problem pakistan must find a way to control its own military on the other hand the situation is exacerbated by the fact that india over these years has refused to allow a plebiscite where the people can vote their own destiny we applauded we were very happy when finally east timor was allowed to vote and overwhelmingly the people of east timor voted to be independent as a result of that of course they paid a heavy price because in a very few days the armed forces disguised as guerrillas and local militia exacted a heavy toll in terms of lives and property but it went forward troops from australia are there now and people who like to put down military interventions and say they are never good i think the people of east timor a very small nation of less than 500 000 people welcomed the entry of the australian and other troops under the united nations command to help bring some justice there well we hope we never have to send troops to kashmir and i doubt if it will be so easy to do that why are we not working on some peaceful solutions to that problem right now why are we not working on peaceful solutions to the problems in a large number of places in the world why do we not spend some money on our peace academy we have a peace academy most people have never heard of it there is an organization with a very tiny budget that does things in the name of promoting peace our peace academy really ought to be as large as our military academies if we are serious we have west point we have the naval academy we have the air force academy we have the coast guard academy we have the war college we have numerous places where we are still training some of our best minds for war for old fashioned war violent war but we have no places where the federal government is investing significant amounts of money to train people for peace so i mention this because the folks who are here pressuring to find billions of dollars for the f22 are off course they are certainly not listening to the american people i think if it went to the american people common sense would set a different agenda they would say what is being done to promote peace how are we investing to promote peace and that would go forward we are not listening though we are not listening to those who want to see justice in the world with the least costly means and that is through a process of peaceful negotiations in kosovo there are some people who have said that it would not have gotten as bad as it was if we had given the peace process the nonviolent approach more resources and they are probably right but that is a matter of hindsight now there are a lot of situations in the world where as a matter of foresight we ought to be investing more heavily in peace but we are not listening the republican majority is not listening to the american people they are not listening on the hmo bill of rights they were not listening they are not listening on prescription drug benefits they are not listening on the minimum wage bill we have a minimum wage bill now which members of the house of representatives have signed a discharge petition for because under normal circumstances we could not get the bill to the floor now that large numbers of members have signed and we also know that a considerable number of members of the majority of the republican party are willing to vote for a minimum wage bill finally we hear rumors that there is going to be some movement on a bill which would merely raise merely raise wages from 5 15 an hour to 6 15 an hour in a twoyear period fifty cents a year over a 2year period considering the fact that we have unprecedented prosperity in this nation our ceos corporate heads are making salaries higher than ever before some of their salaries dwarf the budgets of small countries we are in a situation where the majority the republican majority will not listen to the american people who say it is only fair only fair that we increase the minimum wage so that the people on the very bottom are able to begin to make their work count for more people who are making minimum wage a family of four who lives in poverty they are still below the poverty line at this point if they are making a minimum wage let us raise it over a twoyear period by one dollar republicans have a counterproposal the leadership of the majority of the republican party has not committed themselves but there are proposals to raise it 25 cents per year over 4 years the unprecedented prosperity that we enjoy now is not enough to make them sympathetic toward a 50 cent increase per year but it appears that finally they are going to listen to the point of yielding to a minimum wage bill being placed on the floor if they can exact a high price for business there may be some compromise coming i think it is important it is important to people in my district new york is one of the states with large numbers of people who are still making only the minimum wage and we need to help those people who are working get better rewards for their work the welfare reform bill is coming to a point now where the limits are going to be kicking in and more people are going to be thrown off welfare certainly some mothers of young children and they need to have jobs out there that at least pay 6 15 an hour instead of 5 15 an hour the republicans are not listening but i think we have reached the 80 percent point at least 80 percent of the american people are saying we think that it is only fair that there be an increase in the minimum wage what the republicans are proposing in the area of programs that help the people on the bottom the most are across the board cuts at this point we have the appropriations process which is creeping forward i said this this first year of the 106th congress is a tragic comedy it is tragic that certain vital things are not getting done it is a comedy to see the kinds of proposals that keep popping up that they expect us to take seriously even the republican candidate for president has stated that he does not want to be identified with certain proposals that have been made recently one proposal to cut off the lump sum payment of the wage extension that people get as a result of having worked and not making enough money they now want to cut that into 12 parts and pay it out on a monthly basis instead of the earned income tax credit being paid in a lump sum at one time i think the reaction of the republican candidate for president was he does not want to be any part of an action which attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the poor i applaud his candor and i applaud his truthfulness but that only led to another absurd and very harmful proposal by the republican majority now they are proposing across the board cuts let us cut everything drastically the health and human services bill which contains most of the programs that benefit the poorest people in america that was being targeted as the last bill to come out of appropriations where the highest amounts of cuts will be made now they are getting a little more generous and saying we are not going to just make them bear the brunt of the burden we will have it across the board and all the appropriations bill will be cut and let everybody suffer at a point in history where we have the greatest prosperity this nation has ever known we want to go to the american people and say we are going to cut title i we are going to cut head start we are going to cut food stamps we are going to cut aid to college students the pell grants and student work programs we are going to cut we are going to cut and say with a straight face that we are being responsible this is responsible because we need the money in order to put it into a pot for a tax cut a tax cut for people who are working and earning sizable amounts of money most of the tax cuts the greatest benefit of the tax cuts would go to the richest people in america that is responsible that is listening to the american people the fact that the polls show that most people have used their common sense and said look this tax cut does not make sense the people who need it most are not getting it the people who need it least are getting the most why do we need this kind of tax cut i am in favor of a tax cut i am in favor of a tax cut but we ought to start at the bottom and cut the payroll taxes on the poorest people in america the biggest increases in taxes over the last decade has been in the payroll taxes social security and the taxes of medicare the taxes that have been imposed on everybody and poor people have paid the biggest increases so let us start there and cut the payroll tax first and then come up and cut the people at the lowest income levels first and keep going so we can give the middle class which probably suffer the most because they have enough money to really place them in jeopardy in terms of unfair taxation but not enough to be able to benefit from all the loopholes and the corporate giveaways so they suffer the most the middle class needs some relief but that is not the way the republican majority proposes to handle the tax cut after they have across the board cuts their tax cut will not give the money to the majority of the people in america in any kind of significant way so they are not listening they are not listening eighty percent of the people say this tax cut proposal is no good but they are not listening when it comes to education and school construction that is a high priority the american people keep demanding it i have been on the floor time and time again saying that the people want more federal assistance for education they want more government involvement at every level whether we are talking about the state government or the city government or the federal government they want more government my people in my district need help they are tired of situations where the children have to eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning because the school is so overcrowded and most of the schools in my district there are twice as many students as the school was built for so it is overcrowded from the time they come in in the morning to the time they leave and the lunchroom cycle has to be arranged so that the lunchroom is not overloaded at any one time that means that some schools have to have three and four lunch periods if they have to have three and four lunch periods in order to get the kids in there safely and out then they have to start having lunch in somecases at 10 00 in the morning that is child abuse to make a child eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning is child abuse but it is going on in large numbers of schools because they see no way out in the same schools there are some students being taught in the hallways some being taught in closets there are situations where the presidents proposed bill to give money for more teachers at the lower grades cannot help us because of the fact that if they get more teachers they do not have a way to reduce the classroom size because there are no classes in a first grade class one teacher cannot be put in one corner of the room and another teacher in the other corner of the room and expect to have any productive teaching taking place it will not happen so as we get more teachers in order to reduce the size of the classes they need more classrooms it goes on and on and the public says look we are tired of it we want more done about education and we want specifically to have something done about school construction school infrastructure school repair school wiring things related to the physical infrastructure i have been saying this for some time so i guess my credibility in this house would not be that great because one might say i am prejudiced i am locked into a position let us look at the polls that all of us politicians respect the abc news washington post poll released on september 5 1999 says the following support for education over tax cuts we find that improving education and the schools will be very important to 79 percent of americans when choosing the president next year more than any other issue more than any other issue only 44 percent say cutting taxes is very important making it 14th out of 15 issues do my colleagues want to know what the 15 issues are the top five issues according to the abc news washington post poll released on september 5 1999 is one improving education 79 percent rank education as the number one issue handling the economy 74 percent managing the budget 74 percent handling crime 71 percent protecting social security 68 percent now the fact that any one of these made the top five is such that i would not quibble about which is most important first place or third place or fifth place those are top five education is always in the top five for the last 5 years sometimes it trades places with social security and sometimes with crime education has always been there in this poll 79 percent say improving education is the top issue what are the lower five of these 15 they are still important issues helping the middle class 61 percent handling gun control 56 percent still over the majority feel that handling gun control is important handling foreign affairs 54 percent still over a majority over the 50 percent cutting taxes below the 50 percent only 44 percent are interested in cutting taxes campaign finance reform 30 percent i am sorry to see that campaign finance reform is down there so low but to make the top 15 is important considering this nation has more than 250 million people and all the opinions of different problems and issues to make the top 15 is important campaign finance reform is one of the those issues where i think we elected officials members of congress and others have to move public opinion we have to explain to the people we have to use our own set of principles and our own values to help guide public opinion into realization of how dangerous it is not to have campaign finance reform and to have money play such a great role in our democracy let me just go a little further on this education issue when we take the education issue and break it down into parts the polls show that 80 percent of americans support at least three education priorities what are those three priorities fixing rundown schools ninetytwo percent favor fixing rundown schools 92 percent only 7 percent opposed and 1 percent says they do not know let me just say that again fixing rundown schools 92 percent favor and only 7 percent oppose are we listening is the republican majority listening is the democrat minority listening are our democratic leaders listening is the white house listening we do not have in this congress adequate proposals to address the fact that 92 percent of our people say fixing rundown schools is a top priority eightysix percent say that reducing class sizes is a top priority 86 percent favor 13 percent oppose 1 percent says they do not know but reducing class sizes 86 percent favor and 13 percent oppose placing more computers in the classroom 81 percent favor 16 percent oppose 2 percent do not know a lot of people will say well that is a luxury computers in the classroom hookup with the internet all this stuff we need pencils and papers we need chalk we have got to stay with the basics well i think the common sense of the american people have run off and left members of congress who think that computers educational technology hookups with the internet all that is not vital to the education of children in 1999 who are going to be in a cybercivilization tomorrow they are going to have to take jobs in a world where if one cannot use computers and use them effectively there is very little hope for one ever having the opportunity to make a decent living so placing more computers in the classroom is of vital importance the common sense of the american people has sensed this instincts have told them that this is important we are privy to all kinds of studies we know as members of congress that we are considering another bill to bring in people from outside the country who would fill the jobs and information technology because we have so many vacancies there is so much pressure from industry here in this country to get more people from the outside to take these jobs we know that most people out there do not know that but their instincts tell them their observations at a very low level without all the benefits of the staff and the studies that we have say that computers in the classroom are important in other words 80 percent of americans support at least three education priorities fixing rundown schools reducing class sizes placing more computers in the classroom i think i have just begun to tell my colleagues that the three are inseparable if we do not fix rundown schools if we do not create more space if we do not allow funding for schools to be able to wire for the internet and in many cases the wiring in the walls will not take and they have to be rewired in many cases they have asbestos problems and that has to be taken care of as a construction issue so fixing rundown schools is vital in order to be able to put more computers in the classroom fixing rundown schools of course is obviously vital if we are going to reduce class sizes in the places where the children have the greatest amount of problems with reading and where we want to reduce class size in order to be able to give the early teachers the elementary grades a chance to be able to help kids more to learn to read to establish the basic fundamentals that allow them to be successful in school in those places they have the worst physical plants the worst infrastructures they do not have any classes they need more classes before they can have reductions in class sizes we are not talking in new york city this fall about the tremendous shortage of classrooms and the overcrowding we talked about it last year and the year before now the silence is such that one thinks the problem has been solved and resolved it has not there is more overcrowding now because there is a great increase in the number of students that have gone into the schools there is more overcrowding now because children are being held back on the policy of no social promotion some children of course last year had to go to summer school and had to attend summer school in buildings that were so hot that it was torture for young kids to be in those buildings during the summer because they have no air conditioning and they have very poor ventilation then they found out some of those same kids should not have had to be there because they had passed the necessary tests and they did not need to go to summer school in order to qualify for advancement to the next grade there had been an error an error in the calculation of the test to show us how blunders place children at risk and make them suffer the private sector i think was involved in that testing blunder as well as the board of education but let us put that aside for a moment and consider the fact that there is silence in new york city a city that had 2 billion in surplus last year and did not spend a penny to help renovate repair help building those schools not a penny of that surplus went into the schools there was silence at the state level the state had a 2 billion surplus and the governor vetoed a bill which called for 500 million to help repair schools the burden should not only be on the shoulder of the federal government we need movement on the federal government because in the process of having the federal government move we hope to stimulate and drag along other levels of government in this process of getting schools built why do i think it is so important because as i said many times before in any religion the state of the temple the church or the synagogue the way the physical building looks is the beginning of the assessment of the way people feel about that religion if it is a dilapidated rundown neglected building then nobody is going to take the parishioners seriously about their religion and the way they feel about it because that symbolism that highly visible statement of how one feels is there when one does not take care of school buildings one sends a message to parents in my community and certainly in inner city communities across the country that we have abandoned the schools that is almost true the major leaders of america the people who are in the power structure have abandoned public schools in their heads already many have overtly done it others do not realize yet but the way they behave their hesitation their neglect their sins of omission means that they have abandoned public schools already because if one does not move to build and rebuild the physical infrastructure then all hope is lost parents have no hope when they hear the rhetoric of the department of education of the white house or the congress or any member of the congress they hear the rhetoric but they see the schools collapsing they see the schools have leaky roofs crumbling walls they see the schools have coal burning furnaces there are still more than 200 schools in new york city that are burning coal and jeopardizing the healthy kids immediately and causing respiratory illnesses among teachers when though see these things happening they are correct in not believing that elected officials are serious about maintaining the public school system is it any wonder then that so many inner city parents white and black and certainly a large number of black parents are opting to support vouchers more than 50 percent in certain surveys in a survey that was taken last year 57 percent of black parents in inner city communities said that they would certainly support vouchers in order to get their kids a decent education they did not have any faith left in the public school system that is most unfortunate but that is a truth i have to stand here and admit they have given up hope because they realize that their child only has one life and they only go through the process of being educated one time and they cannot afford to wait any longer they are desperate but in their desperation they are turning to a system which will also disappoint them because all we have done is create a hope in a false institution that does not exist the private sector cannot handle the millions of youngsters in public schools who need help there is a large scholarship program that was developed by some millionaires in new york and they put up large amounts of money and a thousand youngsters could be provided with a scholarship which allowed them to go to a private school of their choice the money that they got as a scholarship would pay half of it thousands and thousands are on the waiting list because there are no schools to accommodate all of those young people there are no private schools that can accommodate it it would take 20 or 30 years to build a private school system that could accommodate the 53 million children who now go to public schools in america it is not an answer to the problem and the parents who have given up hope are only going to have their hopes dashed greatly as a result of this illusion that is being created by people who wanted to destroy public schools to make a point and to prove that the private sector can do it better if they lose a generation they are so cold hearted that they do not particularly care what happens to that generation but that is about what we are facing a generation will be lost while we try to get in place a private school system to replace a public school system which now takes care of 53 million students it is most unfortunate i can only close with the same message that i have brought here before many times both parties are negligent in focusing on the principal problem with the education improvement effort kids must be provided with an opportunity to learn as we try to raise standards as we standardize curriculums we need to focus on the students themselves and provide them with the maximum opportunity to learn at the heart of the opportunity to learn is a physical facility we need a physical facility which can support the opportunity to learn they need a decent library they need decent laboratories they need a clean safe environment conducive to learning we cannot go forward unless we address the issue of school construction school repair school modernization the bills that we are supporting in the democratic caucus is a bill that i have my name on as a cosponsor is totally inadequate it is a bill to sell bonds and the federal government will pay the interest it is a commitment of the federal government over a 5year period to 3 7 billion for the school construction situation under a situation where each locality or state will have h9892 cg to vote to borrow money and we will pay the interest on the principal that is totally inadequate as would he go into a cybercivilization i strongly advise urge and plead that all elected officials understand that what would he need is an omnibus cybercivilization education program to guarantee that the brain power and the leadership needed for our present and our expanding future digitalized economy and hightech world will be there at the heart of such a comprehensive initiative we must set the allimportant revitalization of the physical infrastructure of americas schools these necessary brick and mortar creations will long endure as symbols of this particular set of leaderships commitment to education it will also serve as practical vehicles for the delivery of a kind of hightech education required in the 21st century all of the most brilliant and visionary education achievements of the clinton administration may be merged and focused through these vital and physical edifices we have had a net day movement for the volunteer wiring of schools we had the technology literacy legislation the community technology centers the distance learning projects and the widely celebrated and appreciated erate for telecommunications the lifting of standards the improvement of school curriculums and the support for smaller class sizes are also initiatives that require the additional classrooms and expanded libraries and laboratories that school modernization will bring we are not listening to the majority of americans the republican majority is not listening and too many other people in other places also are not listening we need to listen on all of these vital issues whether it is the hmo bill of rights prescription drug benefits minimum wage the need to fund hhs right across the board with increases instead of decreases or school construction all of these are areas where leadership is needed where the demands right now in a time of great prosperity and peace are that we lay the foundation for a cybercivilization and we do that with an education program that is across the board seeking to improve education but starting with the allimportant area of construction of new schools"], [1.0728836059570312e-06, 0.999998927116394, 1, "yesterday we began debate on a bad labor hhs education appropriations bill a bill that cuts 2 9 billion from education services cuts 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to the wealthiest two percent of their fellow citizens republicans have proposed cutting 1 billion from targeted investments in education to improve teacher quality and recruit new teachers denying afterschool services to 1 6 million kids and eliminating headstart assistance to 50 000 kids they have also proposed cutting nih 439 million below current services and cutting 16 million from clintons request for battered womens shelters these are the kinds of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make sacrifices so that the wealthy can reap benefits slowing our progress in health education and labor in order to make room for tax cuts for the wealthy does not fit with our national priorities democrats have proposed a fiscally responsible substitute that targets tax relief to farmers and small business i urge my

gears and talk about the federal public lands the largest landowner in the united states is the federal government and by far by far the largest owners of land are the federal government the state government the city government the local districts et cetera et cetera et cetera we depend very heavily on the use of public lands i thought i would begin tonight by showing some examples of some beautiful public lands now i am a little biased in this regard my state the state i represent is the state of colorado and i have been very fortunate to represent the 3rd district of the state of colorado many people have been to aspen many have heard of glenwood springs or steamboat or telluride or durango breckenridge summit county grand junction there are a number of different communities that some people have visited they know about the colorado rockies the colorado rockies are a gem they are a diamond for the united states we need to do what we can do to preserve those while at the same time while at the same time allowing people to live out there we are going to cover a little of that let me first of all point out this is in the district i will use my red pointer here we will see the red pointer on the sky above the mountains this is the maroon bells one of the most beautiful settings and i am sure many of my colleagues have been there this is fall obviously which can be seen by the colors many many thousands and thousands of visitors whether handicapped whether 19 years old and have great big legs everybody gets to have access that can get here can go up there and see this beautiful beautiful gem of our country the maroon bells i know the maroon bells i was born about 40 miles away my brother climbed the maroon bells when he was 14 years old right there on that peak where the red dot is unfortunately during that climb a rock came off the top he was in outward bound school and it killed his instructor he was 14 or 15 years old we have a lot of family history and there are a lot of people in this country that have a lot of history in these mountain ranges i am from the mountains so are many of us but the mountains are something we believe in we have a strong heritage with the mountains we want to protect the mountains now that is what this looks like today see my red beeper my little light there the lake that is how it looks today why does it look like that today is it because we allowed oil well drilling to go up on top of it no is it because we put mines in there no is it because we clear cut all the sides no is it because we let them fish out the lake no is it because we let them pollute the water no what is my point my point is that for 200 years and before that with the native americans we have taken care of this land washington d c would like to convince us that this thing is full of oil rigs that the timber that the small families that make a living off timber go up there and clear cut this land that the fishermen fish out the streams that the streams are polluted and that the only way to do this is move the west wing of the white house to now have that command center for the western united states they think it matches west wing western united states so they come up with a program 40 million acres now what does 40 million acres mean many people if they own a home they are on a lot size maybe they have i do not know half an acre a half an acre where their home is located imagine 80 million times that half an acre that they own and that is what the president today has proposed to in essence take off limits what i am saying here is these are assets these are museum pieces these mountains are beautiful we know this we want to protect them but we have to use common sense and in using common sense we cannot just do it for the elite people of this country we have to consider the common man of this country and i say that generically we have to speak for the common person in this country do not forget about them not everybody can have a farm or a ranch in aspen colorado not everybody can own a home in aspen colorado i certainly could not afford it and most of my colleagues on this floor could not afford it but that should not keep us from being able to go up and enjoy it it should not keep us from being able to go up and recreate on it like skiing i can say within eyesight of maroon bells one can see several of the major ski areas in the world have they polluted the maroon bells no have they caused clear cutting in the maroon bells no do they provide jobs for colorado yes thousands of jobs do a lot of people get to enjoy the recreation of skiing in aspen colorado yes lots we have to be careful about allowing an administration who by the way rarely sets foot in colorado and last year when they locked off a big chunk of the state of utah they announced it the president announced it in the state of arizona come put your hands in the soil come put your hands in the dirt mr president come see what you are doing before you do it know a little something about it before you talk about it i know about it i was raised there my family has been there for generations let me show my next display here these are the fourteeners look at this all over colorado i will point out there is the young compadre peak this one is the mount of the holy cross right here where my finger is i will put the red pointer so it can be tracked by the red pointer columbine park look at all of these we have over 54 of them over 14 000 feet in colorado form these beautiful mountain ranges do my colleagues see any clearcutting that has gone on no do my colleagues see any oil rigs no do my colleagues see tents and cities and condominiums and town homes all over those 14 000 foot peaks no why do my colleagues not see them it is because we protect this land but we protect it with common sense we do not lock everybody out of there one can ski on some of those mountains one can cross country ski in the summer guess what we have discovered something it is a wonderful sport it is a fabulous sport mountain biking one gets to mountain bike a lot of this does it tear up those mountains no are people who use those mountains responsible for the most part yes for the ones who are not let us go after them if this is an asset if they are going to abuse it kick them off but do not kick them off in general just because they are human beings do not put all of the four systems of the united states into a museum the federal lands i will show my colleagues a couple other here real quick this right here this is a winter scene here in colorado take a close look at that look at that snow do my colleagues see bulldozer tracks through that snow no my colleagues do not even see snow machine tracks through that snow why because we have designated trails we manage those lands out there those lands are not just important to the united states they are important to those of us who make a living off of those lands my inlaws for example david and sue ann smith my colleagues ought to visit them they live in meeker colorado you want to talk about salt of the earth people you want to talk about environmentalists do my colleagues know why they are environmentalists they have got their hand in the soil every day ask him what he thinks about that ranch ask him what he thinks about that ranch when people come up and offer him millions of dollars for that property they do not want to sell it they love that land the smith family is pretty representative of most of the ranching families i mean the president is about to go out and destroy the way of the west the territory remember the judge from the supreme court go west young man go west maybe it was greeley horace greeley said that go west young man go west do not wipe it out do not make it an urban area do not restrict it for the presidents museum at the white house work with us and help us protect this in a common sense approach a common sense approach this is colorado these are more peaks that i want my colleagues to see beautiful absolutely beautiful those are protected president clinton does not need to skip in and protect them any more than they are protected right now we are preserving them we know how to take care of this land what i am saying to my colleagues in my district alone and i say my district the peoples district that i am lucky enough and fortunate enough to represent in that district alone we have over 23 million acres of governmentowned land 23 million acres we take darn good care of that land we have a lot of uses of that land recreational land recreation wilderness areas we do have some timber we have very little mining left anymore we have a lot of different uses for that land president theodore roosevelt i want to quote him because the president in the last couple of days wants to put out an image that he is the theodore roosevelt the teddy roosevelt who rode in on the bucking bronco to save the west let me tell my colleagues what teddy roosevelt said i think it is very important here because he talks to the common man president teddy roosevelt was known as a common man he understood the ways of the east he understood the ways of the west i think before somebody lifts themselves to that standard they ought to at least qualify for it let us talk about teddy roosevelt conservation conservation means development as much as it does protection i recognize the right and the duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but i do not recognize the right to waste them or to rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us that is the approach the balanced approach in essence what he is saying is there is a right for people to use these lands but there is no right no right by the people that use these lands to destroy these lands for future generations we have got really two extremes one end of the spectrum over here one end of the spectrum over here this end of the spectrum says hey we ought to be able to go out there and mine it and clearcut it and develop it all we want over here on this extreme we have got organizations like earth first lock them out put everything in wilderness take away the right of multiple use i will talk about multiple use here in a minute take away those rights but do my colleagues know what most people in america and certainly most of the people that live here feel that in the middle ground there we can do both we can allow some ski areas we can allow cross country skiers we can allow mountain bikers we can raft on those wonderful beautiful rivers in colorado we can hike yeah we can allow a power line to go across them to some of our communities that are circled by federal lands there are things we can do with federal lands we are going to restrict it we are going to be balanced on the other hand they also say there are places the same group that says one can ski and ride on mountain bikes and raft down the rivers that same group the middle group as i call it the real westerners as i call it also believe hey there are some areas like the maroon bells that we just saw like this area right here to my left just like this area where my hands are there are some areas we need to lock those away let us put those into wilderness those are appropriate wilderness or let us create a national park just like senator campbell and i did with the black canyon national monument we just converted it to a national park or let us create a new monument or let us make this a specialuse area or let us give this a species status a certain endangered protected status there is a reasonable ground in there what the president has done is laid his chip he has staked out his ground on this extreme to me that is as offensive as the people over here that stake out their claim that say we ought to be able to mine it at any cost let us go in and cut the timber we do not need selected timber cuts lets go in and cut it that is as extreme as the president is attempting to do over here for earth first and that is clearcut those forests abandon those forests and put them into the museum let us talk about a concept that is very important very important for the united states and for all of us to understand during my discussion this evening that is the concept of multiple use now many of us many of my colleagues may have never heard of what multiple use means well obviously one puts use together with multiple it means many uses many different kinds of uses remember just a couple of minutes ago in my comments i talked about skiing mountain biking rafting grazing grazing ones cattle timber mining lots of different uses wilderness environmental fishing things like that those are multiple uses i think this map is an excellent illustration if my colleagues can follow my red dot on the map obviously this is a map of the united states this is government lands my colleagues can see where the blob of government lands are they are not in the east there are some in the carolinas there are some up here in the northern part and illinois and the great lakes but the big bulk of federal lands are right here well when the united states acquired these lands through different acquisition methods the population was all along here in the east and they decided they needed to move the population to the west follow the red dot out to the west well when they got them out here to ohio and nebraska and kansas and texas oklahoma and some of these states out here those are pretty fertile states the way to encourage people to go out west when we wanted to settle the frontier back in the last century was to give them land grants or let them go out and put a stake in the ground and claim that land 120 acres or 160 acres let us go back to the map in these areas for example in kansas in nebraska in the dakotas out here in the midwest farm country one can support a family on 160 or 320 acres or some other type of government land grant but what was happening and washington was aware of it is there were not many people coming into the mountains they were not going into this area they wanted to settle this area of the west the question came up how do we encourage our pioneers to go to the west to go beyond the colorado rockies or to get into the rockies and into the mountains and go west how do we encourage people to settle shall we give them 160 acres under land grant like we have to settle the midwest and up to kansas and so on well the answer came back pretty simple one is dealing with different terrain the mountains cannot support per acre what the great plains states can support per acre so if we give 160 acres to somebody for agriculture and that was the driving industry obviously back then the agriculture and mining if we give it to them for agriculture they are not going to be able to make it off 160 acres in fact they need thousands of acres to do what somebody can do on 160 acres of real fertile land or 220 acres of real fertile land so they thought about it and said we cannot go out politically and it may not even be right to go out and give citizens several thousand acres of land simply through a land grant program what can we do how do we resolve this therein was the birth of multiple use that is a concept that concept was the government said okay and again follow my pen on the demonstration here the way we can get people to go up into this territory of the united states let us introduce this concept of multiple use which simply means that the government retains the ownership of the land we will call it public lands but the people have a right to use the landsnow when i grew up and when my father and mother grew up before me and so on down back in the generations there was a sign that hung out there we still see it once in a while but there was a sign that hung out there on public lands for example when one would go into the white river national forest one would see a sign that said welcome to the white river national forest underneath it hung a sign that said a land of many uses that is what the sign said today there is a very concentrated attempt to take off the sign that says a land of many uses throw it in the trash and put on a sign that says no trespassing that is the defeat of the concept of multiple use now maybe this would have worked i doubt it but maybe that no trespassing would have worked 150 years ago but the government itself this country itself encouraged its citizens encouraged its people to become pioneers go out and settle the west be cowboys be farmers help this country we need people in the west so generation after generation after generation including not only my family but my wifes family and our children has spent generations in those mountains that is how we make a living if one wants to put up ones no trespassing sign to those of us in the west one will break us we are not large in number we are large in heart we have got a lot of heart in our feeling about this but one will break us keep putting up that no trespassing sign unfortunately a lot of people that are encouraging that are these over here on this extreme that i spoke about earlier my colleagues have to imagine if they can pretend for a minute that they are a ranch owner that they own their own ranch there are several things that they need to do to be a responsible ranch owner number one they need to visit they need to go out into their fields they need to get their hand into the dirt number two they need to understand nature they need not to defy nature they need to work with nature nature renews a lot of natural resources such as water only if they treat it right so they have to understand nature the other thing that they have to do is manage different segments of that ranch they may want to manage the strawberry patch on their ranch a little different than they manage their grazing area where they have got their cattle well it is the same thing here the united states has millions and millions of acres in public lands let me give my colleagues some of those statistics ninetyone percent almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns is in the western united states thirtyseven percent almost 37 percent of the land in the state of colorado primarily in the mountains is owned by the federal government the forest service the blm and the national park service manage 95 percent of this land the national wild and scenic rivers system contains 10 900 miles of wild scenic and recreational rivers we have got a lot of land out there and most of it is owned in the mountains by the federal government how do we manage that land what kind of management tools do we have let me talk to my colleagues about a few of them in order to manage federal land we do not need to lock everything up as some proposals like the president he says take 40 million acres again colleagues picture what 40 million acres is imagine how many people make a livelihood off of 40 million acres 40 million we have lots of ways we can manage that land and protect it so it looks just like the beautiful maroon bells that i just got done showing my colleagues or like the 54 peaks over 14 000 feet that i just got down showing you or the snowy scene in the colorado rockies that i just got done showing my colleagues we have ways to manage that land protect it for the future but reach that balance that teddy roosevelt spoke about teddy roosevelt said you have a right to develop that was the word back then of course it is a sin to use that word today but back then that is exactly the word that teddy roosevelt meant today we use the word use you have the right for use but you do not have the right for waste you dont have the right for abuse for destruction and he is right he is absolutely right well how do you manage this to help protect it we have national parks we have national monuments we have national preserves we have national reserves we have national lake shores national seashores national rivers national wild and scenic rivers i just told you elevensome thousand miles national scenic trails national historic sites national military parks national battlefield parks national battlefield site national battlefields national historic park reserve study areas national memorials national recreation areas national parkway coordination areas national forests national scenic areas national byways national scenic research area conservation research programs national research and experimental areas national grasslands national conservation areas special management areas national forest primitive areas national game refuges national wildlife preserve areas national wildlife refuges national wildlife protection areas we have lots of tools in our arsenal to manage these public lands we should not just go to one tool we should not put everything in a national park we should not put everything in a national wilderness mr president before you put 40 million acres 40 million acres in essence locking people out of it look at what the consequences are to the people who have preserved it all of these years it is very very important for us to understand a couple other ramifications not just the soil not just the land but right here with my cold tonight i have been sipping on water to keep my voice because i feel it very important to talk to you but that is water in colorado let me give my colleagues a little quote from the poet thomas ferrell it is in the colorado state capital i saw it when i served in the state legislature and the quote is here is a land talking about colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water colorado is a very unique state in colorado we must be overly protective of our water rights number one it is something that a lot of other people want colorado provides water for probably 18 to 23 other states believe it or not the country of mexico has water rights in the state of colorado for some of that water colorado is the only state in the union the only state in the union where all of our water goes out of the state we have no free flowing water that comes into the state for our usage in colorado we are an arid state an arid state meaning we do not get much rain when you look at those beautiful mountains you say wow it looks pretty rich to us but we do not have the kind of thick vegetation that a lot of my colleagues do in the east in their district in the east their problem is getting rid of water in the west our problem is storing water we have to store it because since we do not have much rain the only real opportunity we have for mass volumes of water is for the spring runoff assuming we get the winter snows and that spring runoff only lasts for about 65 maybe at the most 90 days so over the balance of time we have got to have it we have got to store it or we do not get it now what happens is that the water law in colorado is unique as well and the same for a lot of the western water law it is different than the east as i mentioned earlier it is entirely different but there are some organizations out there who understand this and those organizations really have two things in mind one stop any kind of use from the water and that is one way to drive people out of those mountains and the second thing is let us take the water for our own use i do not know many organizations in the east who have the interests of the people of the state of colorado or have the interests of the people in the west in mind when they look at our water rights they look at our water rights like a great big piece of apple pie and they are hungry and they think it ought to be theirs although they did not bake it or anything else they think it ought to be theirs so they put their arm around us and they talk to us friendly and they do all kinds of things but their goal is to put that apple pie in their mouth and keep it out of our stomach that is what their goal is so what do we do we have to be protective and when the president comes out and does as he did today set aside 40 million acres of public lands to essentially lock them up when he does that what are the implications to water in the west well i can tell my colleagues right now that the national sierra club that earth first and some of these kind of organizations their goal is that every acre he locks up ought to have with it implied water rights you ought to be able to reach outside that acre let us say this is an acre of land right here this is an acre of land they would like to have the government step outside of this acre up here or over here or over here to control water rights these are very very valuable rights and in essence what the next argument will be is hey we realize that president clinton back in 1999 set aside 40 million acres and certainly what he wanted to do is to also lock up the water necessary for all of those 40 million acres even though we may not be using the water for agriculture or anything we have certain water rights like we want the quality et cetera et cetera and they start reaching outside that territory it happened in colorado we have the wilderness act when the wilderness act was enacted by this congress by the united states house of representatives and of course the senate and the president there was never any kind of discussion of water rights in about 1985 judge cain out of the federal district court said although there were no water rights for the federal government although the federal government does not seem to have any automatic water rights there must have been an implication for water rights so the federal government now has implied water rights for the wilderness areas we have been fighting that battle for a long time same thing is going to happen here my colleagues now for you in the east my colleagues so what we need the water what do you mean so what that is our lifeblood remember my quote here is a land speaking of colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water it is a huge difference to us what are some of the other things that these 40 million acres can do the other implications we do not know but it could be all of a sudden there are air rights for the federal government all of a sudden the federal government could reach out to an adjacent town say silt colorado or grand junction colorado or glenwood springs colorado which borders the white river national forest or meeker colorado which borders the white river national forest on the north side and they could say to those communities you know something you have too many cars in your community you have too many people burning wood fireplaces and those communities could say we understand that we try and do our own no no no here is what the federal government out of washington d c is going to tell you communities in the west how you are going to run your communities there are lots of implications to the action that the president has taken today now what they will try and give you is an allusion that if we do not follow the presidents lead if we do not listen to the advice of earth first if we do not adopt point by point the national policies of the national sierra club that these beautiful mountains that i showed you a picture of will be destroyed that the water in the west will be polluted that the trees will be clearcutted well let me tell you what happens if we follow their agenda write off mountain biking forget skiing forget river rafting forget the other recreational uses that we have out there hunting going throughout in a 4wheel drive vehicle on marked trails all of the different kind of things that you can recreate with in colorado in the longrun those could very easily be diminished significantly maybe never ended completely because we have some private property although every ski area to the best of my knowledge and i have almost all of them in the third congress district in my district almost every one of them is on public land those are the kind of implications that we are speaking about here it sounds warm and fuzzy today and it is very easy to appeal to the entire country by saying what i have done is to do as teddy roosevelt or as i just heard somebody on tv say it is the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries do you know what the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries we have let the people that live in those mountains help manage those mountains we let the people who really have their hands in the soil every day now my hands are not in soil but take a look at my fatherinlaws hands or my motherinlaw or my parents or many many people out there in colorado i could give you name after name after name what we have done right is let those people who are on the ground there every day every hour help us manage those lands we did not kick them off now once in a while we have had abuse and we get rid of them and maybe we need to tighten the laws on that i am up for that and i am not for saying that we do not have additional areas out there where these kind of restrictions should be placed but 40 million acres by simply throwing a fishnet over the western united states that is what has happened the president got a big fishnet and just threw it as far as he could and out it floated over the western united states and wherever there is public lands haha we will lock it up i am not attempting here to be provocative to try and be derogatory what i am trying to do here is one make us all cognizant of what life in the western mountains is all about number 2 the fact that we have beautiful beautiful diamonds out there meaning the mountains and we all want to protect those and three i want to tell you do not just write us off we have too much to lose we are fellow citizens and we live in a beautiful large expansive area but there are not a lot of us out there so it may be pretty easy for many of my colleagues just simply to write us off but i am asking you not to do that take a look at what it really means what kind of impact you are going to have you are going to hear in the next few days many statements about how bad mountain bikes are i guess probably more realistically they will take some kind of thing that just on its face they will want to make it sound offensive logging for example you know i have known a lot of small families these are not the big logging companies these are small families that are in the logging business why do you want to wipe them out manage them do not wipe them out help them do not destroy them my gosh mr president i wish that you could go to dinner some night go to dinner tonight what you should have done is made this announcement of this lockup of this 40 million acres and then gone to dinner with a small family in colorado somewhere that cuts timber and does it responsibly how happy do you think they are tonight it is going to destroy some people out there but that will not happen the people in washington d c especially down the street are not going to take time to see what the impact is on people as my good colleague the gentleman from arizona said earlier this president committed to put people first they are not going to go out and see where it puts people instead it is much easier to be politically warm and fuzzy and say the west is being destroyed and we in the east must step into the west and defend it defend it against itself we have got to protect those people those families and pioneers out there in the west those ranchers those river rafters those hikers those skiers those residents that live out in the west we have got to protect them from themselves they are destroying themselves that is what the image is here in washington d c that is exactly what the image is that this president is trying to portray to you people with this sign with this signature of 40 million acres set aside in colorado most of us that live out there including myself my family my wifes family we are not wealthy people we are there because we have a job i have been fortunate i have a job representing those people but all five of my brothers and sisters all of my nieces and nephews all of my cousins there are probably 30 or 40 first cousins they are all over colorado why are we able to stay in colorado because we have a job we have a job that may not sound like a lot up here we get paid we have got an automatic job for 2 years back there some of these people depend on their jobs almost day to day let me give my colleagues an example of what kind of jobs we have in colorado on the white river national forest the white river national forest has two predominant uses twothirds of the forest the predominant use in twothirds of it is recreation in onethird of the white river national forest the predominant use is wilderness we have locked it up i voted for that and it was appropriate to do that but we intentionally left twothirds open for recreation why number one they do it in a responsible fashion two it provides resources that are not available you cannot put a ski mountain out in ohio they do not have a lot of skiing in kansas they do not have much skiing in mississippi or missouri or louisiana or nevada they have some in the sierras but not much colorado has got the natural resource for it what does that do that white river national forest just that forest thirtyfive thousand jobs my neighbors in a lot of cases have those jobs that is how we are able to stay out in colorado we are not johnnycomelately we did not just jump out to colorado all of a sudden to live our families many of our families have lived there for generations my family and my wifes family have lived there for many many generations but we still welcome people to come out to colorado sure we think it has grown too fast we wish it were not growing so fast but we do not think we have the right to shut the door because they did not shut the door on us back in the 1870s when my family came in or the 1880s when loris family came in they did not shut the door on us they said come on in but we only ask you one thing when you come to colorado or when you come to the rockies or utah wyoming or montana be responsible help us make this a good community to live in help us retain the beauty of this state help us follow what teddy roosevelt said and that is there is a right to use the land but there is not a right to destroy the land we think we can use the land the federal public lands in colorado or in the rockies or in the west in a responsible fashion i happen to think you can build a ski area and manage it in a responsible way many of you have skied in colorado many of your constituents have skied in colorado you have been there you have seen that a lot of those areas they are managed okay it has been a fun family vacation it was a nice way to recreate then when you take a look at the areas that are cleared for the ski runs they are just a pinpoint a pinpoint in the forest many of you have had the opportunity to river raft in the state of colorado or utah or wyoming or montana it is a blast if you have not done it do it it is a great time and it is a great family activity we have not destroyed the rivers we have been doing what teddy roosevelt said to do use it but dont destroy it some of you may have never heard of lake powell but many of you probably have do you know what lake powell has done for families in this country how many families are down there instead of having their kids running out to the mall or dad running down to work they are down together on a little boat on lake powell that lake does a lot it recreates use it but dont destroy it the roosevelt theory it is a lot different than the other theories that have come out when we talk about this when we talk about where we are going with the future i have got to tell you as long as i am in this elected office i am going to stand as strongly as i can for colorado and for water rights in the west i am not just saying that because never in my entire career have i felt more of a challenge to the taking of colorado water than i do today and never in my career have i felt more of a challenge to those 35 000 jobs on the white river national forest those are not indirect jobs those are direct jobs thatis not 35 000 in fact it is 35 000 families live off that forest i have never felt a larger threat in my political career to those jobs thar the visioncoming out of washington d c the vision that we cannot manage it the vision that theyneed to protect us to protect us from ourselves how many of you have ever mountain biked out in colorado that is a relatively new sport but if you have you have really gotten into some of that terrain and you have been able to access it you did not have to hike for miles you have been able to ride in there on your bike minimal damage to the environment we managed it well despite the fact that washington thinks they need to protect us from ourselves we followed the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it it is the same thing with any other type of activity you can imagine whether it is kayaking whether it is hiking and so on you get my message my drift what i am saying here now what about some of the other issues what about some of the other jobs i do not think it is shameful to have a sporting goods store and sell sporting goods in colorado i do not think it is wrong for a small family to try and go out and harvest some timber by the way if you harvest timber with correct management it is healthy for the forest it is a renewable resource and by the way every one of you in this room tonight every one of your constituents uses wood that istaken out of some forest somewhere at some time every chair in here you look around you know what i mean wood is everywhere it is a renewable resource but you have to follow the roosevelt theory the roosevelt theory is use it but dont abuse it it saddens me to think that here in washington d c frankly a lot of the national press is buying this hook line and sinker they are biting at it just like that it troubles me that back here in the east that even the administration in the west wing they do not go to the western united states they make this decision in the west wing they have got some confusion there it bothers me that they are using a deception upon the american people that this land out there that we are not taking care of that land it is public land it is all of our land i am telling you we have been on it for a long time we have lived on it for a long time we have worked it for a long time we have used it for a long time and we have not abused it for a long time folks do not be sold on this do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because of the fact that we have ski areas do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we have mountain bikes do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we allow peopl to river raft and hike and hunt do not automatically assume because it is not true we do follow the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it i know that tonight my time is rapidly expiring but i just want to reiterate a couple of things number one do not forget that the pioneer spirit still exists for a lot of us we are very proud of our heritage we are ameri cans but we also come from the west i feel very respectful of the people of the east but i am not an easterner i am a westerner i am not out here to destroy the lifestyle of the east and i ask you people in the east do not go out of your way to destroy our lifestyle in the west we do not need the eastern united states the bureaucracies in washington d c to protect us from ourselves i think we much much better than some of my colleagues and some of the people in the east understand that land much much better than you ever will we have got our hands in the soil all of us can agree that a commonsense approach is what is reasonable but that means that these people out here who want to clearcut every forest who want to put a ski area on every mountain who want to build a house on every ridge who want to put a highway wherever they want to who want to build townhouses wherever they want that means these people are going to have to be movedto the middle and the people out here like earth firstand other hardcore groups out there who think they only have the title to the environment who think they only have the knowledget to protect that land who think onlythey have the historical background to manage that ranch for all of us that group has also got to be brought to the middle and here in the middle is not the leader of the united states today the president of the united states bill clinton that is not who is here in the middle today he is over here what is in the middle today was what was in the middle at the turn of the century and many years ago and that is teddy roosevelt teddy roosevelt is who is in the middle and remember and i will conclude with teddy roosevelts comments and i will paraphrase him you have the right to use it but you dont have the right to abuse it or destroy it teddy roosevelt had it right it should be teddy roosevelts path that we follow do not be misguided down the path of president clinton follow the path of teddy roosevelt use it and enjoy it but dont abuse it and destroy it"], [2.1010139334975975e-06, 2.1010139334975975e-06, 0, "i thought i would take a few minutes to kind of report on what the last couple weeks were like when i was back home spending time with my constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"],

inadequate in the fight against crimes of hate present laws do not prohibit crimes against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender deputy attorney general holder urged congress to pass legislation that would expand federal authority to prosecute those responsible for such crimes on may 3 1999 i hosted a community discussion at clark university in worcester massachusetts on this timely and important piece of legislation h r 1082 the hate crimes prevention act of 1999 the forum brought together scores of community leaders and organizations including the national conference for community and justice the human rights campaign the safe homes project the massachusetts rehabilitation center and the jewish federation of central massachusetts over the past few months we as a country have witnessed horrific crimes motivated by hate last year james byrd junior a 49yearold black man was murdered in a brutal attack in jasper texas his alleged assailants three white men dragged him for 2 miles while he was chained to the back of a truck four months later matthew shepard an openly gay student at the university of wyoming was kidnapped robbed beaten and burned by two men on a cold october night this young man with a promising future died 6 days later recently in littleton colorado certain high school students appeared to have been specifically targeted and murdered because of their race and chosen faith in my own district the jewish community center in worcester massachusetts experienced the evils of antisemitism when nazi swastikas were painted throughout the facilities those who participated in the community meeting last week shared moving accounts on the effects of intolerance these crimes attack the very democratic foundation of our country the hate crimes prevention act would expand the situations where the department of justice can prosecute defendants for violent crimes committed because of the victims race color religion or national origin it would also authorize the department of justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of the victims sexual orientation gender or disability current federal law does not cover crimes with these motives in 1997 the latest year for which fbi figures are available over 8 000 hate crime incidents were reported that is nearly one hate crime every hour clearly the time to pass the hate crimes prevention act is now over 40 states have hate crimes statutes including i am proud to say my home state of massachusetts however only 21 cover sexual orientation 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability by strengthening the federal law state and local authorities will be able to utilize federal personnel and investigative resources hate knows no boundaries we need a law to protect all americans tough federal hate crimes legislation would give our justice system the tools and authority to recognize acts of violence committed on the basis of a persons gender race ethnicity sexual orientation or religion by recognizing these incidents and punishing those responsible we can begin to eradicate these acts of hate from our schools our neighborhoods and our country dr martin luther king junior believed that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere by passing this legislation congress will send a clear and powerful message that we will not tolerate these violent acts which not only change the life of the victim but affect the entire community the ripple effect caused by these crimes sends shock waves throughout the targeted community often leaving fear despair and loneliness in its wake we all need to join together to break down the walls of ignorance and to build a community founded on tolerance justice and compassion the allies of hate are not just the perpetrators silence and complacency are allies as well the enemy of hate is a community and a congress that does not tolerate hateful messages words or deeds we must take a stand and pass the hate crimes prevention act of 1999 now not next year or sometime in the future but now"], [2.8751326226483798e-06, 2.8751326226483798e-06, 0, "that is exactly right i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding and also for the leadership that he has taken on this issue in helping us communicate with the american people with our colleagues here exactly what it is that we are trying to accomplish as i was listening to the debate today on the floor i could not help but be struck with the thought that the other side must have a severe case of schizophrenia because our friends on the other side of the aisle were saying on one hand that we are spending social security which we are not and at the same time they were saying that we were not spending enough and so you had two different messages coming out in the course of the debate that we had today the reason that we are not spending social security is because we made a conscious decision a deliberate decision as a matter of principle that the people who work hard in this country and pay the fica tax the payroll tax ought to have some assurance that those dollars are going to go into their retirement security and so we made that conscious decision a very long time ago and in order to be able to do that to ensure that we were not raising social security as wa have been doing as the congress has been doing for a good number of years we had to come up with a way in which to make sure that all the important priorities of this federal government get funded and so we decided that the best way to do that would be to accomplish the savings through a 1 percent acrosstheboard reduction or a 1 percent acrosstheboard savings if you will by giving the agencies of the federal government a mandate and a mission to find 1 percent 1 percent in waste fraud and abuse within their respective agencies in order that we could keep our commitment to the seniors of this country to the young people of this country who day in and day out roll up their sleeves go to work work very very hard to pay the taxes knowing that someday hoping that they will be able then to collect that and to provide a secure retirement for themselves and for their family i think that in listening again to the debatetoday i think the other side is profoundly confused about what it is they want to do because again they were attacking us for saying again which we are not that we were going to dip into social security and yet at the same time lambasting a 1 percent acrosstheboard savings in all the federal budget as gutting all these programs that somehow this is going to take away from the families of this country and the only conclusion i could draw from listening to that was that either they think we are spending too much or they think we are not spending enough and i am not sure which it is but i think their side was very confused in this debate today and i think for our side the issue is very very simple it is really a matter of whether or not we are going to ensure and insist upon the commitment that we made that social security taxes go into the social security trust fund and are used are reserved there for the retirement security of the american working public and until that time happens we continue to pay down the federal debt which is another priority that we have made for a long time now just out of there is a chart here and i am not a big one for using charts but in the event that anyone out there is confused by what has been happening here in washington the last few years this illustrates very clearly the raid if you will on the social security trust fund the amount of money that has been spent out of that fund over the course of the last 15 yearsor so it totals almost 638 billion as a whole lot of money that has come out of the social security trust fund and has been used by the federal government to pay for the costs of other federal programs we said categorically that has to stop as a matter of principle it is wrong for this country this government to collect money from people which they expect to go into a retirement fund that will be there when they retire and then have those dollars used to fund other areas of the federal budget and i guess my big problem with the whole notion of the way that the federal government operates is there is a good amount of call it waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and i certainly believe and i think the american people believe i think anybody in my state of south dakota would certainly concur that anyone looking at the federal budget closely could say i think we can find 1 percent i think on a dollar of federal spending we can find one penny in savings one penny is all we are saying to the federal government it is tighten up a little bit let us just see if we can find one penny in savings out of the entire federal budget the oiscretionary side of it if all we do if we can just save one penny it will allow us to honor our commitment to the seniors of this country and to again the people who work hard every day to pay the payroll tax and we do not have to do this any more i think the best part and what i like about this graph the most is what happens in 1999 when it goes down to zero and that is what we were able to do today with the votes that we took we made a commitment we have passed 13 separate appropriations bills we have passed them in a way that does not violate our commitment to the american people that enables us to honor that commitment to protect social security and still keeps the government running now all you heard today from the other side again was it is going to cut this or this or this and the usual suspects that are always mentioned but the reality is whether it is defense whether it is education whether it is law enforcement we spend in this budget what we passed today and what we have already sent down to the president more on those priorities than what the president had proposed in the first place even after we trim one cent out of every dollar now we all talked about this the other day there certainly are ways that we can find a penny in savings whether it is in the area of foreign travel that has been mentioned some of the trips i mean the president may have to reduce the number of people who travel with him 1 700 to africa 800 on another trip and it is only as my colleagues know a small percentage of savings really that we are talking about and you look at some of the things that the federal dollars have been spent for the 26 000 people who are deceased who received 8 5 million in food stamps according to the committee on the budget those who have collected ssi payments illegally and there is a convicted murderer who received more than 75 000 in ssi disability payments during his 14 years on death row and of course the one i like the best is the million dollars that we had to spend for the outhouse at glacier national park the people who have to walk 62 miles up 7 000 feet to use an outhouse that was bought and paid for by the federal government surely when it comes down to our sense of priorities we ought to say to the american people that a million dollars for an outhouse versus a million dollars into a social security trust fund that will protect and safeguard the retirement security of americans it ought to be an easy choice for us and i think what happened today unfortunately for those on the other side is we took away in many respects their ability to spend and we have said as a matter of principle social security should be protected it should be safeguarded and that hurts deeply for those who over the past 15 years have found it to be the social security trust fund and the social security surplus to be their sort of spending balloon well today we popped that balloon and the american people are going to be better served as a result of that and we have gone a long ways toward protecting and safeguarding the social security retirement dollars that the people in this country worked very very hard for worked very very hard to pay and i am very happy to report to the people in my state of south dakota and to all the american public all the taxpayers out there that this was an important historic day here in washington because we popped the spending balloon the social security trust fund that has been raided for the last 15 years and said categorically it has got to stop here that is a principle with which i think the american people will agree and i am proud that we were able to come up with the votes today in order to do that and i would say to my friend from texas and my friend from new hampshire who have been leaders in this effort in the effort to bring federal spending under control to eliminate wasteful spending to make sure that the american taxpayers are getting the very best return on their investment that i appreciate the leadership that you all have taken for the opportunity to participate with you this evening in this discussion and again to reiterate to the american people that we want to make absolutely certain that the dollars that you pay from mr fica actually are going into the social security trust fund this was indeed a historic day here in washington and a day which i think again that the american people will be very much benefited from so with that i would yield back to my friend from texas"], [2.91313244815683e-06, 2.91313244815683e-06, 0, "over the last several years many of us have been asking a question that we hear time and time again back home i have the privilege of representing the south side of chicago and the south suburbs communities like joliet and lancing and morris and rural communities like tonica and elsewhere and they often ask me a pretty basic question that question is as we talk about taxes they say why why do married working couples a husband and wife who are both in the workforce why do they pay higher taxes when they get married they ask is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes on average 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes than identical couples who choose not to get married but live together outside of marriage that is not right the folks back home tell me that it is time that those of us here in washington should do something about it that we should work to eliminate what has been called the marriage tax penalty 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is a lot of money back home in illinois 1 400 is one years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty this thursday we will be considering in the house legislation approved by the committee on ways and means h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say now has 236 cosponsors including almost 30 democrats who have joined with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we help real people let me introduce a couple here this couple here shad and michelle hallihan of joliet illinois two public school teachers in joliet illinois they happen to make about 60 000 in combined income from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let us work together let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty there are no excuses we want to be fair eliminate the marriage tax

representative tanners motion to recommit the bill to committee where it can be improved should that motion fail we must reject this irresponsible bill the leaderships bill eagerly spends a surplus that may never materialize it commits almost the entire nonsocial security surplus to tax cuts ignoring other critical needs like reducing our 5 6 trillion national debt it jeopardizes funding for education veterans benefits agriculture and other basic programs which will have to endure huge cuts over the next ten years if these tax provisions are enacted it spends hundreds of billions of dollars that i had hoped we would use instead to reform and strengthen medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit making it extremely unlikely that medicare solvency can be ensured without slashing benefits or increasing costs for our senior citizens the bill also directs twothirds of its tax cut benefits to the wealthiest 10 of americans and close to half of the cuts would benefit the richest 1 of taxpayers with incomes exceeding 300 000 and although the price tag attached to this bill is staggering enough it pales in comparison to the costs that will result once all of its provisions are in full effect a decade from now from 2010 to 2019 this tax package would cost the treasury 2 8 trillionseveral times the initial cost of the bill and a burden that cannot possibly be borne while maintaining adequate funding for domestic programs and continuing to pay down our debt like many of my colleagues i support certain provisions in the leaderships bill including in particular the phaseout of the estate tax and the elimination of the marriage penalty in fact i am a cosponsor of standalone bills that would accomplish both of these goals but i simply cannot ignore this reckless and dangerous use of a budget surplus that should be divided among several equally important needs rather han snatched up before it even exists and lavished on the wealthiest americans at the expense of programs that benefit our working families and elderly due to some of these same concerns i will also vote against the democratic substitute although this alternative is a more responsible and targeted approach it still makes the dangerous assumption that a large surplus is guaranteed for the next ten years and beyond if this does not prove to be the case we will all suffer when our debt continues to spiral out of control funding is no longer available for some of the most basic federal programs and the solvency of social security and medicare becomes a goal that is no longer in reach the yea vote i cast today will be for representative tanners motion to recommit this bill to the ways and means committee the motion mirrors the fundamental principles of the blue dog budget that i along with a majority of democrats and 26 republicans supported earlier in the year this motion changes none of the specific provisions in the majoritys bill instead it simply requires the committee to reduce the overall tax cut to onequarter of the onbudget surplus and to create a debt reduction account to ensure that half of the onbudget surplus is preserved for reducing our debt altering the bill in this way would ensure that when there is a surplus there will also be a generous tax cut but it will also allow us to be secure in the knowledge that our debt will continue to be reduced and that our children and grandchildren will not have to shoulder the burden of our recklessness i consider myself extremely fortunate to have entered congress at a time when the tough choices made by my colleagues and predecessors who balanced the budget in 1997 are beginningto yield tangible results i now consider it my duty to maintain the fiscal responsibility that led us to this point and ensure that we do not recreate massive deficits like the ones weve just escaped from we all want to reward hardworking american families by returning some of their tax dollars but i cannot in good conscience do this at the expense of our future fiscal health therefore i will support the motion tb recommit because i believe americans deserve a responsible tax cut when we are sure we have the money to pay for it but i will vote against h r 2488 because i also believe americans deserve a balanced federal budget a solvent medicare and social security system and the knowledge that the

committee on resources the gen state of alaska tleman who has represented the state for example in my district we are of alaska for a number of years alas totally dependent totally not parka is a wdnderful wonderful state tially totally dependent on multiple most of alaska i think in the high 90s use of public lands for water every maybe 96 percent of alaska is owned by highway that we have in my district the federal government i wish i had comes across federal lands the water time this evening to talk to my col when i go back to water it is either leagues about what happens and the stored upon originates or comes across differences between states that are pri federal lands all of our power lines marily owned by government and all of our cellular telephone towers all states that are primarily owned by pri of this is on federal lands in my parvate individuals ticular district of which we have the many of my colleagues here on the premier ski areas in the world aspen floor come from states where their pri or vail or telluride or powder horn or mary ownership in their state are pri purgatory i could go on and on and on vate individuals many of us come from these areas are dependent very dependstates where the primary ownership in ent our tourism dollars are very deour states is the federal government pendent on these lands we are very in colorado for example my district is very i guess you would say over a pethe third congressional district of the riod of time we have become encomstate of colorado my district geo passed by the concept of multiple use graphically is larger than the state of i want to talk just for a moment florida and on the eastern line of my about that concept of multiple use district which very simplified runs what happened in the early days when from wyoming down 125 to new mex our country was a young country we ico it exempts out the cities as you go basically had this as our country our down but from that eastern border to forefathers the leaders of our country the atlantic ocean that land there is wanted to settle the land that we had very little federal government owner purchased in those days possession ship of lands out here in the east you that is where the saying by the way have the appalachias you have the ev possession is ninetenths of the law erglades down there and then in a lot possession meant everything in the of states you have the local court early days of our country if you did house you may have a park here and not possess the land somebody else there but the reality of it is if we took could come in and they did not care a map for example of the united whether you had a deed or a document states and we looked obviously i am that said you own it they came in not an artist but if we took a look at they sat there with a gun and said i my eastern border here is colorado own that property the point i am making is from this once our country made purchases point right here to the atlantic ocean like through the louisiana purchase federal ownership or government own and things like that what happened ership of land is represented about like was taking this out for a moment this with the appalachias here the they were trying to figure out how to everglades the park up here in the get people to leave the relative comnortheast if you were to look from my forts of the east and of the settled border this district the third con communities in the east how do we gressional district and go to the pa get them out into the new frontier cific ocean you are going to find out how do we encourage people to go out that government ownership of land there and set up a home or set up looks like this obviously that is a towns because as a country we need to rough drawing but that is pretty sig possess the lands like the louisiana nificant purchase or we are going to lose them there are a lot of differences between to some other country living in areas where the ownership of so what they decided to do was let us the land is by individuals and living give land everybody in this country it out here where our zoning and planning is an americans dream to own a little commissions are dictated by decisions piece of land to own your own little out of washington d c for example house it is the american dream so they used this incentive go west young man go west to do that they said let us have a homestead you go out into kansas you go out into missouri you go out there you find 160 acres or you find 320 acres you farm it for enough years and you get to keep it it is your land that worked pretty well what we saw were fairly dramatic movements of population into these areas but when they got to the west where it is very arid we do not have the kind of water it does not rain in the west like it does in the east when they got out west the crowd started going around nobody was sticking around in here why because they discovered in kansas for example or missouri or even eastern colorado or down here in some of these states in the midwest states pennsylvania and so on they were discovering that with 160 acres you can support a family you have enough acreage there to grow a farm but they also discovered that when you got to the mountains for example or to the more arid acres sometimes 160 acres would not even feed one cow so the settlers were not staying there at the nations capital they said what do we do about this how do we get settlers out here before we lose this land how do we get them to move in there somebody came up with the idea it takes 160 areas of good fertile ground in missouri for a family that is the equivalent in the mountains of colorado it might take 2 000 acres so let us give them 2 000 acres they thought about it the policymakers back then and they said wait a minute we cant give that away that is too much for one person then the idea was born well let us go ahead and have the government retain the ownership in other words the government will continue to own this land out here but let us let the people use the land that is where the concept of multiple use came from when the gentleman the chairman of the committee on resources stands up and talks about alaska and talks about your oil that is why alaska is primarily owned by the government because of the fact of the differences between states in the west and states in the east and so i think it was important i acknowledge the gentleman and appreciate him coming to speak with us i want to address another point i had the opportunity to come down and listen to some of my respected colleagues prior to my having the opportunity to visit with you it sounded like it was the george w bush bash hour what can we bash george w bush about that seems to be a favorite thing by some of my colleagues here lately what policy can we find of george w bush lets just bash him somebody ought to stand up here and say a few things that george w bush is doing right and a few ideas that i think will work for this country on a bipartisan basis that both sides of the aisle ought to acknowledge let us take an example let us talk about social security for example social security we ought to look a little at the history we know that we had the depression in 1929 in 1935 the president decided and this country and this congress on this floor decided that we should have a national insurance policy a social insurance that is where social security came about but there are a few factors to remember about social security when it was first conceived number one for every person that was retired in 1935 we had 42 workers out there working fortytwo workers for every person retired what has happened over a period of time is the number of people that are working has gone down in proportion to the number of people that are retired today instead of being 42 to one today it is three to one it is three to one that has created a problem for social security number two and this is good news for all of us colleagues this is good news the modern medicine that we have developed and the vaccines and the ability to fight things like chicken pox and polio and things that were horrible diseases of the past and with godspeed we can find a cure for cancer in the future but these diseases have in a large part been conquered the average person in the united states in 1935 could expect to live a male 62 years old a female 65 today that is almost in the 80s we have had a dramatic increase in the life span for our citizens in this country unfortunately no adjustment has ever been made in social security number one because of the number of active workers that have been reduced and two because of the extended life span of these individuals so what is happening is today we have a social security fund which on a cash basis means cash in the bank is in the plus column but when we look on an actuarial basis and what do i mean by that word i mean when we look into the future and say okay here is the money we have here are our future obligations do we have enough money to cover all of these future obligations that is what is called actuarial thinking on an actuarial basis social security is bankrupt and who is the individual that is running for president that has stood up and i think in a bipartisan approach come up with a plan now it is a bold plan gore and the president they have called it a risky plan you have got to take some risk you have got a plan that is in trouble not in trouble for my generation i am 47 not in trouble for my parents my parents are going to be guaranteed any of the colleagues any of your seniors their money is not going to be interrupted really from about 45 on up their money is going to be there but the young people of this country the people that george w bush has talked about the people in their 30s the young workers that are starting out in their 20s those are the people that are going to face the dramatic problem on social security if we do not take a bold move you can call it risky as al gore has called it but the fact is you have got to do something that is what leadership is about if you do not want to lead stand aside we are not going to leave you behind but you are not a leader somebody has to get out there with a bold plan i can tell you that the plan that george w bush has proposed is not exactly in my opinion something that is novel you say what do you mean novel well i think that george w bush and his social security plan they looked around and said go~h how do we test market my proposal how do we test market something for the younger generation that will save social security you know what they found it it has been test marketed it has been out there and used you know what it is working the logical question that one would ask is well where is this test market where are the results who is using the same type of basic plan that george w bush is proposing for all of america where is your test market on that you know when corporations or businesses or people want to try a product they go out and test it first so you prove to us mcinnis where is this test market you know where it is it is right here on the house floor us you know what we are treated differently than other americans every federal employee is treated differently than other americans how we have our own separate retirement plan now we are participants in social security and we do pay into social security but as you know we have another plan every federal employee 3 million of us in this country have been test marketed and that plan is called the thrift savings plan what is the thrift savings plan number one it is voluntary you are not required to participate in it exactly what george w bush is saying with the partial investment of social security dollars number two it gives you choice exactly what george w bush is talking about when he talks about his social security plan number three it guarantees you a payment regardless of the choice that you make exactly what we have in our thrift savings plan and exactly what george bush has proposed in his plan how does the thrift savings plan work as you know we get our check and there is an automatic deduction taken out of our check for social security there is also an automatic deduction taken out for our retirement so as a federal employee and remember this applies to all federal employees not just to the congress but to about three million federal employees so they take out a small amount or an amount out of your check for your retirement you have no choice on that you get no choice as to where it is invested you do not get a choice as to whether it goes into the stock market or whether it goes into bonds you have no choice on it on the other hand the tradeoff is you are guaranteed a payment when you retire but then after that is said and done you get to take up to 10 percent of your pay and you can invest it through the thrift savings plan and the federal government will match the first 5 percent so you get to take 10 percent they match the first 5 percent and you get choice you are not required to do it by the way and what kind of choices do we have our choices are one you can go into savings accounts which are guaranteed by the government just like if you went to a local bank fdic approved you get that but the return is low the lower the risk the lower the return the higher the risk the higher the return the very low risk option zero risk almost and you get a low return or you can go into something like the bond or the stock market you have that choice what is wrong with george w bushs proposal to give choice to the american people what is wrong with our generation the older generation looking to the younger generation like my children my children are grown now what is wrong with my generation saying to this generation hey you ought to have a little choice we ought to give you a choice on some of your investment dollars george w bush has not gone out and said take all the social security dollars and let this young generation decide if they want to put it all in the stock market of course that would be reckless conduct that would be careless there is not a financial mind in the world that would tell you that would be a smart thing to do what george w bush said is give them up to 2 percent let us try it out it works for american government employees why can it not work for the young generation the women in this country that are young and just getting into the workplace the young men and the families if we do not do something do you know what the return is if we stick with the status proposed which seems to be what is proposed by the al gore policy here is what your return is 0 09 percent that is a rotten return that is what you get to expect assuming that we can keep it afloat so a young couple today let us say a young lady named joyce and a young man named john and john and joyce go out into the workplace and their social security if we do not change this thing number one it probably on an actuarial basis will not be there for them and if it is if the stock market continues to boom and we know in case you have not read in the last few weeks it has leveled off but if it continued to boom which it will not do forever then that is about what kind of return you can expect how can we do this come on it is an obligation it is a fiduciary duty on every one of us in this room to stand up for this next generation behind us and the generation behind them and the generation behind them if we are going to hive a social security program let us give them a social security plan that works for the american people let us not make american federal government employees an exclusive set where they have a little different arrangement than the very people who put us here the people that pay our checks are the taxpayers we ought to take that into consideration we should not treat the taxpayers of this country who are not federal employees different than we treat federal employees why not change social security i see positive things instead of standing up here in a very partisan way and bashing george w bush why do we not stand up here and talk about what i think are the good policies and the good recommendations that he has made if he becomes the president i think you are going to see a very positive change for social security those policies will work because they have been test marketed it is not new it did not just fall out of the sky these policies work they have been tested and they have been tested on 3 million people and do you know what the participation rates are in the high 80 or 90 percent of federal employees that want to get into this program because why because it works that is why they want to get into this program let me change subjects because i heard some other bush bashing going on and i think once again somebody has to come tell the other side of the story paul harvey who by the way i had the privilege of meeting paul harvey a couple of weeks ago in pueblo colorado where we honored about 100 medal of honor recipients and paul harvey was kind enough to come out there at his expense to speak to us but paul harvey has a famous saying you have all heard it and now for the rest of the story that is exactly why i am over here this afternoon talking to you you heard one side of the story bush bashing bush bashing on social security bush bashing on taxes bush bashing look do you know what there are a lot of good things in there why not look for some 6f the good colleagues instead of trying to spin it out of control because of the political necessities of an election coming up here in 4 or 5 weeks let us talk about taxes and let us talk about what the republicans frankly with a lot of help from conservative democrats have done with their tax policy number one the republicans again with help from conservative democrats who came across the aisle we sent to the president of this country a death tax elimination now whetheror not you think you are covered by the death tax i think it is a fundamental question it is the same thing by the way with the marriage tax elimination the republicans with help from some conservative democrats sent to the president of the united states a marriage tax elimination to eliminate the tax because of the fact you are married and to eliminate the tax because of your death on both occasions the president vetoed both of them now let us talk about it the basic fundamental question you need to ask about the death tax and the fundamental question you need to ask about the marriage tax is should death or marriage should those be taxable events in our society you know what the majority of us stood up and said no unfortunately the administration disagreed they think that marriage should bea taxable event they think that death is a taxable event not only do they think death is a taxable event i sit on the committee on ways and means i know about finance and taxes the presidents budget the president and vice president the clintongore budget this year not only did not even consider elimination of the death tax they actually proposed an increase of 9 5 billion a 9 5 billion increase in the death tax you should not increase it you should not keep it the death tax does not collect a lot of money let me tell you when you hear and i have heard this over and over again when you hear wvell this only benefits the upper 2 percent of a community wake up it does not just affect 2 percent of the community let me give an example colorado you take a small town in colorado i have a small community in colorado where somebody who by the way lived the american dream started out with nothing worked all his life his entire dream in life was to be successful so he could pass it on to the next generation and spread it in the community he had a construction company by the way to be eligible for the death tax on a construction company if you own free and clear if you own much more than a bulldozer a dump truck and a backhoe then all of a sudden you are facing the death tax that is right a bulldozer backhoe and dump truck and you are facing the death tax this individual passed away from what you would hear from the people who think that the death tax is a fair tax that it is fair to tax somebody on property they have accumulated that they have already paid taxes on simply by the fact that they died what you need to look at is what the impact is on a community what happened when he died they took 70some percent 55 percent of it for the death tax 22 percent on capital gains or 28 percent excuse me on capital gains and they took 70some percent of that estate and moved it out of this small town in colorado and they moved that money to washington d c to be redistributed by a bureaucracy you know what the money in a community ought to stay in a community i do not believe you ought to be able to tax death as a taxable event but it sure would be a lot more liveable if you went to that small community and said look just in spite you had somebody who was successful so we are going to tax them on their death but you get to keep the money in the community remember the death tax where it came from the death tax came as kind of a geteven tool with the carnegies and the fords and the rockefellers that is where that thing came from from people who wanted to declare class warfare who said look this is a great country and we say if you invent the better mouse trap you get to reap the reward as long as you do not reap too many rewards because then we are going to come after you that is exactly what happened in the twenties and so on this is a tax that should never have been created it is a tax that hurts our communities it is a tax that hurts our environment this is a country that ought to pride itself in encouraging its citizens encouraging its families to pass abusiness from one generation to the next generation what builds the strength of a country is family that is what builds our strength and for a government to go out and discourage and actually penalize the transfer of a business or the family farm or the family hardware store from one generation to the next generation is fundamentally flawed it is flawed with the concept of what we have as government now maybe in a communist country or in a socialist country where everybody is not paid on what they are worth they are paid on what they need so no matter what they do it is not what they do for society it is what they need so you equalize all those payments that is what the concept of a death tax or a marriage tax comes from especially a death tax that is not what we want in this country that is not what ought to be happening to our communities by the way you heard me right when i tell you the death tax hurts our environment you say wait a minute how does the death tax hurt our environment you know how it hurts it in my district in colorado a beautiful district i live in the highest place in the nation the highest elevation in the nation if you have been skiing in the mountains in colorado if you have been in the mountains in colorado the essence is you are in my district the people discover the beauty of this what happened is we have family farms and ranches out there and what is happening is people are coming in and the families are having to sell these they want to farm they want to ranch they want to have that piece of land but they have to sell it you know where that land goes it does not continue as a ranching operation it does not continue as a farming operation it continues as a few hundred more condominiums or a few hundred more townhouses or a brand new shopping center that is what is happening to that land out there and a lot of it is due directly to this death tax so do not stand here and bash george w bush because he wants to eliminate the death tax do not stand here and bash george w bush because he says marriage should not be a taxable event what you ought to do is as some of the democrats have done join the republicans in our fight to get rid of the death tax join the republicans as some conservative democrats have done and get rid of the marriage tax instead what happened unfortunately we saw the majority of democrats go with the president and support the presidents veto of getting rid of the marriage tax and support the president on this death tax i am saying to my colleagues work with us in a bipartisan method we can do something for social security for this next generation we can do something about that death tax we can do something about that marriage penalty let me tell my colleagues in a bipartisan direction when we have worked together in the past the democrats helped us pass probably the largest tax break that we have had in 20 years or 30 years although the people do not realize what we have done the republicans about 3 years ago 2 years ago went out and said the americans dream is about owning their own home so we think in most families the ownership of the home is the largest asset they have that is usually the largest asset in a family what we said the republican bill that we got passed with some help from some conservative democrats on a bipartisan working effort the bill we passed says that if you now own a home and you sell that home for a profit i am not talking about equity i am talking about net income you sell it for a profit your first 250 000 per person remember most homes are owned by couples so it is the first 500 000 per couple but the first 250 000 per person goes into your pocket tax free you get to do that every 2 years that is an incentive for people to go out and own homes and that was supported on a bipartisan effort we had conservative democrats who helped the republicans pass that and that gave the american people a tax break they deserved for some reason there has been a misconception down here on this floor we seem to think that the american taxpayers ought to pay and pay and pay and somehow people some of my colleagues spin it out as if we dare talk about it hey maybe they put in too much george w bush says take half of our surplus right away and put it to reduction of the debt that should be our priority reduce that debt but you still have a little that you ought to put into some programs like education and healthcare and you still have a small fraction of that you ought to give back to the taxpayer pat them on the back and say thanks for what you have done thanks to the productive nature of the american people the american taxpayer this government is sitting pretty well this surplus was not created by the wonderful creative thoughts of your government it was created by our constituents the hard workers the 8 00 to 5 00 people or the 8 00 to 8 00 people out there who produce and create capital government does not create capital government transfers capital government takes it from the workers pockets transfers it to washington d c and then hands it out as if they worked for it that is not what the government is about what i am saying is do not be ashamed to talk about a tax cut they ought to be reasonable tax cuts is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of death is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of marriage i was so excited last night in that debate i wanted to be in that debate not as a candidate but just to get up there and say wait a minute mr vice president what is wrong with the policy of cutting out a death tax what is wrong with the policy of eliminating the marriage tax what is wrong with the homeowners tax break that we gave 2 years ago you did not try and spin it out of control then i am telling my colleagues from a bipartisan point of view we owe respect to the taxpayer and there is no reason to back off and be ashamed because we talk about maybe we ought to thank the taxpayer and say we got enough to operate the government the more the taxpayer provides for the government the sloppier the government becomes sometimes it is a good idea to tighten down on the budgets that forces efficiencies that is why i have taken this podium today instead of bashing bush all the time which i heard minute after minute after minute earlier this afternoon why do we not stand up and say hey here are some policies that we can work on in a bipartisan basis here are some positive things that he has proposed there are very few of my colleagues out here who could look me right in the eye and arguably tell me that our plan our thrift savings plan should not apply to the american people and should only apply to federal government employees there are very few of you i think that could really look me in the eye and honestly tell me look scor we ought to have a death tax how many of my colleagues really support a death tax how many of my colleagues really think people ought to be penalized in tax due to the fact that they are married how many of my colleagues really think that this government ought to engage in discouraging families from passing their hardware store or their farm or ranch from one generation to the next generation not a lot of my colleagues but my colleagues ought to be identified to the american people so they know exactly where we stand the taxpayer does deserve some courtesy we obviously need to reduce the death debt we have to take care of programs like education and health care which are fundamental for the survival of the greatness of this country but the best way that we do it is we look at it in a positive sense and i encourage my colleagues to do just exactly that"]], "top_incorrect": [], "top_unsure":

thank my friend and colleague the gentleman from maine for all the work he has done in the leadership right now i do not think there is a bigger issue facing seniors in oregon and elsewhere in the united states than prescription drugs two months ago a massive ad campaign was undertaken in the portland media market attacking me for defending senior citizens who cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs the ads were paid for by citizens for better medicare a group that looks grass roots an organization that claims to be representing interests of patients and seniors but as we all know looks can be deceiving in reality this ad campaign was primarily funded by the pharmaceutical companies let me set the record straight i do not want to get in a shoving match with the pharmaceutical industry these companies spend tens of millions of dollars to develop cures for diseases and we should take great care to work with them and help them make these essential medicines more affordable for our seniors and working families but in that same light i am not going to let multimillion dollar ad campaigns prevent me from doing something in this congress to act on this issue as members can see i have heard from a lot of people in my district this is just part of it i could not carry it all over some of it is in my oregon office people have sent me letters they have sent me copies of their drugs i want to tell the members something in many cases they are paying 50 percent of their takehome income that is being spent on prescription drugs they are demanding some kind of relief in washington d c this is just a months worth of receipts from harry percy a constituent of mine in salem oregon he had to pay over 200 this month for prescription drugs even though he is enrolled in a health maintenance organization the sad thing is mr percy is not any different from the thousands of other seniors i have talked to or from the hundreds of letters that we see here at my request the staff of the committee on government reform recently conducted a study to determine how much more people like harry percy in the fifth congressional district in oregon are paying for their medication than customers are paying in countries like mexico and canada i requested this study because i found out that a lot of my seniors were going to canada to buy their drugs i was surprised to learn that in the fifth congressional district of oregon they pay 83 percent more for the same drugs than consumers in canada and they pay 82 percent more on average for prescription drugs than mexican consumers these are the same drugs the same amount sold by the same pharmaceutical companies for example an uninsured senior in my district who had to take prilosec to treat an ulcer must pay over 80 more than in mexico or 86 more than in canada for that same drug i also did a study a comparison of how much those uninsured seniors paid compared to the most favored customers that the drug companies sell to in that case they paid almost twice as much than their favored customers we have to change this congress is having a hard time agreeing on how to make such an effort work we need to work together but lately the bigdrug companies have been getting into the mix what they are trying to do is scare seniors into thinking that prescription drug costs will rise if the government tries to help those seniors in the middle yet we know that over onethird of seniors have no prescription drug coverage so they must pay for their medication with their own limited resources as i stated earlier they have made remarkable progress in finding new drugs in helping people live a better life but it does not do any good if they cannot afford to take those drugs seniors i know that do not take the drugs that have been prescribed to them live in pain and discomfort many times if they do not take them they end up in a nursing home or the worst case a hospital or they die prematurely they also suffer anxiety and depression over the fact that they have a hard time paying for their medication american seniors should not pay the highest prices in the world for their prescription drugs frankly it is unfair it is wrong and it is time for this congress to act for any of my constituents that happen to be watching this they can rest assured that i will remain committed to making prescription drugs more affordable and accessible tomorrow i will also sign the discharge petition to try to get this bill on the floor of the house i know we can reach a solution through reasoned debate and bipartisan compromise but it is time for congress to act to assure that no older american anywhere has to choose between buying medicine or food between paying their heating bill or their

procedure this amendment would simply ensure that federal employees have access to that legal medical procedure it would not require a health plan to offer abortion coverage it does not require any
