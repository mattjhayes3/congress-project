{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "2011 marked an unfortunate milestone in our countrys financial picture when for the first time in american history student loan debt actually exceeded credit card debt which again by itself is just a huge statement in terms of the challenges that families middle class families and working families are facing today in terms of trying to deal with the cost of higher education the value of a higher education degree or posthigh school degree which is sometimes debated in the media still i believe is indisputable and the statistics certainly demonstrate that at a time when our national unemployment rate is 8 3 percent if you drill down deeper youll learn that for those with less than a high school degree the unemployment rate is 16 5 percent those with a high school degree its 10 7 percent those with some college is 8 5 percent and those with a bachelors degree or higher is 4 5 percent so the stakes could not be higher for young people all across our country that we must deal with the mounting cost of higher education and provide mechanisms for them and their families to actually finance it and pay for it in 2007 the democraticcontrolled congress passed the college cost reduction act which was a terrific measure that cut the interest rates for the stafford student loan program the federally subsidized student loan program which provided some stability and affordability for middle class families from 6 8 percent down to 3 4 percent in addition we unfroze the pell grant program which is the workhorse of paying for college education all of it paid for by eliminating wasteful subsidies to banks that measure has a sunset this july the interest rate reduction of the college cost reduction act will in fact expire on july 1 unless congress acts president obama in his state of the union address a few nights ago raised this issue before all of us in the house and senate when he said when kids do graduate the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college at a time when americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt this congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in july shortly after his address myself and congressman peters from michigan introduced h r 3826 which is a measure that would extend the 3 4 percent the lower interest rates on the stafford student loan program and in just a few days we have accumulated 55 cosponsors to this measure again the math is crystal clear if we do not act if we do not maintain those interest rates at 3 4 percent if congress does nothing the unitedstates public interest research group has calculated that for those students who take out the maximum 23 000 in subsidized student loans their interest payments will increase by 5 200 over a 10year repayment period and 11 300 over a 20year repayment period now if you told middle class families that if congress doesnt act on a measure like this your outofpocket costs are going to go up 5 200 for taxes there would be a huge hue and cry about the fact that congress must not let that happen well thats exactly the same situation we face today with the stafford student loan program again we know from the passage of the college cost reduction act that this is something that this body is capable of doing this past weekend i was with a family whose son is now in his junior year and as an undergraduate has almost a perfect 4 0 grade average very motivated to go into the health care field and he has already accumulated 100 000 in student loan debt we as a nation must address this problem the national college board which tracks graduation rates internationally reminds us that back in the 1980s the unitedstates was number one in the world in terms of graduation rates we have fallen to number 12 according to the national college board and the biggest reason that students are not finishing college is because of affordability and cost again the president laid out the challenge to the congress in his state of the union address we must not allow stafford student loan interest rates to double on july 1 1l 1010 we should pass h r 3826 we should get that to the president so that colleges and universities can help families plan their tuition payments for the upcoming year and not allow this country to go backwards in terms of making sure that we have the

completion in the northern mariana islands so was born the commonwealth health center volunteers association the volunteers have made tremendous contributions to our hospitals in saipan tinian and rota and have made an appreciable difference to the experience of every patient who receives health care in the northern marianas since its founding the group has donated over 2 million in medical equipment and supplies many of these donations include lifesaving diagnostic and treatment equipment and other supplies that dramatically improve the quality of life for patients and their families the volunteers have withstood the many challenges that have faced our community over the past 25 years and i think thats a good indication of their ability to successfully navigate the next 25 please join me in celebrating the wonderful men and women who founded and over the years staffed and supported the commonwealth health center volunteers association 25 years ago there were two important developments to better serve the health needs of the people of the northern mariana islands one was the opening of the commonwealth health center the other less publicly recognized but also of great significance was the formation of the commonwealth health center volunteers association a group of forwardthinking and civicminded individuals realized the need for volunteer support and fundraising for the new hospital an initial meeting was organized by the late dr jose t villagomez gregorio s calvo juanita dortch angie v guerrero norma matthews and rosa t palacios these founding individuals and the many more who have answered the call for volunteers have made critical contributions to the availability and quality of health care in our local community as in every corner of our country we in the northern marianas have always faced the issue of bridging the gap between providing affordable health care and what the true cost of that care is the chc volunteers association has made tremendous contributions to our hospitals and has made an appreciable difference to the experience of every patient who receives health care in the northern marianas since its founding the group has donated over 2 million in medical equipment and supplies which have benefited health care needs on saipan tinian and rota many of these donations include lifesaving diagnostic and treatment equipment such as telemetry machines nebulizers and hemodialysis chairs in fact they have been responsible for the purchase of two mammography diagnostic units over the years the availability of equipment such as this means lives have been saved it also means our residents do not need to travel to receive medical care with the frequency they once did the groups current goal is to raise funds for a hyperbaric chamber which will cost approximately a quarter million dollars this will help doctors heal their patients more effectively many of our residents suffer from diabetes and the hyperbaric chamber can be used to assist in healing persistent wounds in these patients and decrease the need for amputations many of our residents and tourists alike enjoy deepsea diving and the equipment can also be used to provide lifesaving treatment in the event an individual suffers decompression illness other supplies the volunteers provide are not lifesaving but dramatically improve the quality of life for patients new bedsheets televisions and reclining chairs for example these make extended hospital stays more tolerable than they once we re all of this has been accomplished through the chc volunteers unwavering commitment to improving the quality of health care in the northern marianas every year the group sets about fundraising with an aweinspiring vigor they host a thanksgiving raffle an annual christmas bazaar walkathons concerts and pancake breakfasts just to name a few the volunteers have supported our community in other important ways as well such as sponsoring health conferences and public education programs they have also served as an important link between the commonwealth health center and other charitable organizations and businesses the volunteers have come a long way since their initial fundraising which was accomplished by selling cold drinks and snacks from two portable coolers at the hospital they now operate a fullservice gift shop at the hospital to help fund their endeavo rs a testament to the enduring nature of the chc volunteers association is that some of the original volunteers are still actively involved twentyfive years after committing to do what they could to improve local health care mrs amparo lg tenorio mrs rita v tenorio and mrs rieko m guerrero are still volunteering the volunteers have withstood the many challenges that have

serves our entire population it is important for the youth of today to see all that can be accomplished through good intentions and hard work the group also serves as a constant reminder of the

in blood and treasure in moral authority and global credibility is finally ending thank you president obama when i heard the presidents announcement that our troops would be home from iraq by the end of the year i had one thought its about damn time and my second thought was oh well we have to stay vigilant especially with negotiations still to come about the possibility of military trainers or advisers remaining in iraq as we move forward with a constructive bilateral partnership lets make sure we dont backslide into a renewed military occupation under a different cloak to me however fridays news was greeted not so much with celebration but with relief and also with reflection about the senseless sacrifice endured by so very many people nearly 4 500 courageous american servicemembers gave their lives for this war more than 30 000 have returned home with searing wounds to their bodies and their minds if not missing limbs then too often posttraumatic stress that can make every day a living nightmare and lets not overlook the 100 000plus innocent iraqi civilians many of them children who were killed because the united states of america chose to liberate them when i think about the humanitarian atrocities of this war it is most often the faces of those children that i see then theres the fiscal carnage the 800 billion appropriated to prosecute the war doesnt even scratch the surface of the total cost there is the rise in oil price the interest on the debt weve accumulated and of course the veterans health obligations a promise we must and will keep a

try to put a face on some of the cuts the republicans put in h r 1 i think one of the meanest of their cuts and the stupidest of their cuts is to eliminate a program called youthbuild now im sure most of them dont know what it is they have never met with the kids who come back here every year this is a program that started in 1992 under george h w bush its a program that takes kids who have generally dropped out of high school had problems with drugs alcohol other things but at some point decide they want to get straight and they want to do something better with their lives so this program takes kids between 16 and 24 helps them get their ged gets them some counseling gets them involved in peer groups they learn leadership skills teaches them how to build houses and the houses they build are for lowincome americans in the long term we have found incredible results with this program last yearand these are almost 100 percent high school dropouts with problems78 percent of the kids completed the program thats pretty extraordinary now after when they leave the program the longevity of the effect of this program 7 years after completing the program 75 percent of the youthbuild kids kids who had problems with drugs alcohol homelessness dropped out of high school everything else are either in college or employed in jobs earning more than 10 an hour thats a pretty darn good investment and what does this cost and why would the republicans zero it out well it cost 102 million last year for 20 000 students now we could i guess instead leave them in the street without their high school degree hopeless maybe they would get back on drugs maybe they will get in trouble maybe we will them in jail and then we will spend 30 000 a year to support them in prison twenty thousand bucks for 1 year to get these kids straight and have them become productive members of our society zeroed out by republicans now it is a lot of money thats almost 1 hour of spending for the pentagon across the river almost 1 hour and theres no waste at the pentagon though we are not allowed to look at the pentagon for waste its almost 2 daysthats a lotof agriculture subsidies paying people not to grow things so 2 days of paying people not to grow things or a years funding for a program that takes kids who have been in trouble but want to do better want to learn some skills want to be productive members of society and helps them get a leg up but no in the republican world thats wasteful spending they have zeroed out this program i met with eight of these kids last week i meet with them every year when they come backi urge my republican colleagues for once i asked if they had seen their republican member of my delegation they said no they met with a staff person maybe an intern republicans cant seem to be bothered but they should listen to these kids theres a lot of wisdom there and i think future leaders there they have gotten their lives straight and they have gone through some hard times and we gave them a little help yes 1 year they get 500 a month while they are in the program while they are building houses for lowincome people learning skills and as taxpayers in the future they will pay that back pretty darn quickly now i wonder why they eliminated this program first of all i am sure they dont know what it is they have never met with the kids they dont care these arent people who go to the country club after all but secondly probably because its housed in the department of labor and we hate anything on the republican side of the aisle that has the word labor in it god forbid that america should do things for working people in this country or working people should be allowed the right to organize and have a better life well this is a program that should be continued it should in fact be enhanced they had 19 000 kids who couldnt get in the program last year on the waiting list 19 000 we should double the size of this program maybe triple it that would be a huge amount of money that would be 3 hours of spending at the pentagon or almost a week of subsidies paying corporations not to grow things on surplus lands boy i guess we

unwise and i urge defeat of the amendment i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4999089241027832, 0.9999089241027832, 1, "i rise in support of the senate amendment to h r 915 the jaime zapata border enforcement security task force act and yield myself such time as i may consume the bill before the house today would for the first time statutorily authorize an important border security program the best program under best ice partners with federal state local and foreign law enforcement counterparts to establish targeted crossagency teams to identify disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations posing significant threats to border security the program also serves as a model for interagency cooperation coordination and information sharing which is vital in the post 9 11 environment i would note that it is appropriate that this bill is named in the memory of jaime zapata an ice special agent who was killed in the line of duty in mexico while working as part of a best team h r 915 has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the house passing with overwhelming support earlier this year as well as in the senate passage today will clear the bill for the presidents signature i would like to commend the gentleman from texas for his continued work on this important legislation and for being the sponsor of this legislation the committee on homeland security and congress as a whole benefit from his commitment to border security matters with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.49991034015693003, 8.965984306996688e-05, 0, "i yield myself 1 minute to respond to the gentleman if the gentlemans complaint is that there have been decisions made during republican congresses that he doesnt agree with that spent too much money that didnt yield to balancing budgets the gentleman is correct but the gentleman neglects to point out that there have been many many democratic congresses in the last 50 years 37 of them of which only two of them resulted in a balanced budget that is not a good record either in fact during the 1990s when we were fortunate enough to receive four balanced budgets those balanced budgets were under a republican congress and a democratic president in point of fact it was only after there was a confrontation about the level of spending and a government shutdown that the necessary reforms were made to slow the rate of government spending so we could achieve those balanced budgets the gentleman from north carolina takes credit for his vote in 1993 which i did not agree with im going to take credit for my four votes that were balanced budgets in 1998 through 2001 which he voted against so we need bipartisan support for a rule in our constitution that requires that the budget be balanced every year except in times of national emergency when we should have bipartisan support to not balance at this time it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida chairman of the energy and commerce oversight and investigation subcommittee"], [0.4999158181453822, 8.418185461778194e-05, 0, "i am truly honored to have had a chance to serve in congress with my colleague and friend representative jerry costello beloved by his constituents congressman costello has been a staple in southern illinois for many years for me personally he has been a model a mentor and an example of how to succeed in an age of hyperpartisanship congressman costello fearlessly crosses the aisle for his district last year he even championed the no taxpayer funding for abortion act ive also had the pleasure of collaborating with the congressman on two committees science space and technology and transportation and infrastructure he has been such a mentor for me on these committees during my first term in congress and has been a great ally especially on transportation issues and 2nd amendment rights congressman costello will be sorely missed both on these two committees and in the illinois delegation on behalf of my staff and the people of the 14th i thank him sincerely for his service"]]}
