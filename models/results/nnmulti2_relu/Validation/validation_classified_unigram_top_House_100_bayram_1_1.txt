the american people before oliver north took the stand the american people were taking their kids out to little league games and catching a flash of the television and maybe hearing a little radio on their way to work and maybe on saturday night going to the bowling alley they would catch a little flash on the electronic media the point is that central america is complicated most congressmen until the central american situation arose knew little about central america we knew more about europe than we did about our own hemisphere the american people were busy they work they have not had as much time as we do to scrutinize the situation and get the facts about half of the american people did not know what side we were on about half of them thought that we were on the side of the communist sandinistas they confused the sandinistas with el salvador and in el salvador it is a democratic government with communist guerrillas in nicaragua it is a communist government and the freedom fighters are guerrillas what north did was to elevate the debate and take the shroud off this debate that liberal democrats have liked and have worked to append to this entire issue the point is that it is much easier if you are a liberal in america to talk about ollie norths life and times and ask why he got the snow tires or whatever than it is to explain to the american people what we are going to do about the soviets building bomber bases in our own hemisphere or what we are going to do about the soviets building naval ports that can accommodate attack submarines a few hundred miles from the panama canal that was i think the great genius of oliver norths testimony that he raised the visibility of this issue and he framed the real issue and the real issue is are we going to let the

pictures tonight but then this is not a postmortem tonight is march 2 tomorrow is our monthly upordown vote on the contra tyrants the freedom fighters the democratic resistance so let me call this an analysis of where we are going in the socalled historic 100th congressthat adjective given to this body the senate and the house of representatives in these 2 years last year and this year not because of anything we have done that is historical of import but merely because it is a round number the 100th congress over a period of two centuries let us see if we are really going to write history for freedom tomorrow or again become the indispensable arm of the soviet expansion in the western hemisphere then we will proceed to do that same thingbecome the indispensable arm for soviet expansionism in africa because if we crush the freedom fighters in nicaragua the next target is to crush the freedom fighters in angola and at this moment in africa on that atlantic coast in angola there are battles going on at this moment between units on the communist side the forces out of luanda that are being commanded by soviet officers right down to the battalion leveland there are even some rumors that soviet officers are commanding some companiesnot to mention afghanistan i am really shocked having been in about 9 or 10 states over the last month working for the vice president of the united states because i want this george to become the first george since the first president i want him to be the 41st president of the united states and in every single appearance i have made for him on the road one or two people have come up and let me know that they have carefully tracked the record of proceedings in this house either the written record or the national technical means we are not supposed to speak of and they followed the special order that i had on the night of february 3 which i called a postmortem i even used an oxymoron in that at the beginning i did not realize i had said freedom is murdered temporarily of course when you murder something it is permanent what i meant was i had not given up hope what i should have said is it appears freedom is murdered but it is not that is a temporary situation but here we go again tomorrow i have here a document i got from the national security council i have trusted the nsc under every democratic president we had i particularly admired it under zbigniew brzezinski i did not always agree with what president carters national security advisor said but i admired him in this chamber we have people who have utter contempt not only for president reagans policies but for hi national security council but our national security council under this distinguished 4star general colin powell gave my office this document here is what it says on 10 february 19887 days after my postmortem last monththe salvadoran armed forces engaged a unit el pepeto in eastern chalatenango department killing an insurgent believed to be a courier among the documents recovered from the body of the insurgent was the document entitled strategic estimate according to this estimate during the time before the salvadoran elections and the next harvest the insurgency should make blows against vital points increase not only suburban action but urban action and generalize the war on highways in all parts of the countryin other words continue destroying the infrastructure the document actually uses a new acronym gpr which is believed to be the peoples revolutionary war and it says the gpr should fuse the political military struggle the document states that planning must be done in order to get the masses to break through legality and generate anarchy communism loves anarchy the document also assesses the insurgent view of united states policy toward central american and internal salvadoran political matters now even in an hours special order even tightening my stomach muscles and giving you all the energy i can to make you listen i cannot touch on all this so i will by unanimous consent submit it for the record later this is a 19page document in spanish taken off this dead insurgents body as cal thomas put in in one of his excellent columns in the washington times the other day it was called lesson from a corpse here are some of the things it says this is an exact translation during the next few months of the harvest and the electoral campaign a window of great political and military weakness of the army and the government will open our military plan during this time must be of an integral politicalmilitary character we must seek to give military operations a better political content and reach the capacity for destabilization in the rearguard of the enemythe enemy being of course being jos6 napole6n duarte the oneterm elected 5year president of el salvador who everybody around here pretends to love and hug so much i consider him a brave man especially in the capital and principal cities this communique goes on titled strategic estimate we need a wide strategy which combines all tactics and categories of effort we must combine the gt errilla actions of destruction with politicaleconomic destabilization by concentrating blows against vital points it goes on with an excellent analysis you would think this was written by lenin himself vladimir ilyich ulyanov lenin who died 2 or 3 months before his 54 birthday i am 54 and when i think about what that man did died january 21 1924 he was to be 54 years of age on april 22 of that year the way this lenin has influenced the history of mankind certainly the most limprotant man evil or good in a millennium of the most important influence on the course of history given the numbers of people who have died at the hands of communism far more than hitler was able to brutally murder in the 12 stinking years of his socalled thousand year reich the communist killing goes on in most of the continents of the world right at this moment listen to how well this is written as though lenin himself were guiding the pen the special forces must also operate in this way in accordance with their own characteristic including local forces clandestinity and semiclandestinity but all these forces must always maintain their bond with the masses and work toward converting the masses into the largest service and intelligence structure of our army we must understand clearly that our greatest strength lies in our level of accumulated forces and the social timebomb we can use the qpr to fuse the guerrilla military struggle with the struggle of the large numbers of masses so that the fusion with give rise to the general insurrection field comment gpr may be the peoples revolutionary war so hope springs eternal they tried to pull off this general insurrection within 10 days of president reagans inauguration back in january 1982 is that not amazing we have been trying to work this problem in central america for president reagn 7 years and almost 2 months and yet in world war ii starting from scratch with nothing barely getting the draft going we went from pearl harbor all the way to victory in europe in 3 years and 51 g months this has been double what it took to conquer hitler double what it took to wrap up japan by midaugust 1945 and we are still working this problem with my hero reagan still adhering to jimmy carters offthewall figure like the speed limit of 55 advisors in this beleaguered nation of el salvador he says the key factor with the masses is that we need to get to the point where the radical demonstrations turn into revolutionary and insurrectional actions there must be appropriate planning and lines of action which break through legality and generate a state of anarchy disobedience and social disorder and causes the masses and members to make the decision to forget about fear of death never before has there existed objective bases as strong and dynamic as those which exist now which give the opr an integral paramilitary character to advance in the widening and radicalization of the masses movement and the impositions of our con spiratorial policy in the fdp field comment other documents taken in this same capture show the expansion of fdp to be the democratic patriotic front these objective bases will present an opportunity of exceptional importance through all of 1988 and a good part of 1989 get the feeling here we are going to be voting on contra aid again and again and again in the second session of the 100th congress and in the 101st congress and thereafter until the cancer of communism is removed from managua then he goes on another couple paragraphs however the context of the document seems to imply that the third forces and possibly the other terms are references to garnering support from untraditional sources for example as the document states from within the united states it must be taken into account that other forces can do a lot to help us get to the moment most appropriate to achieve victory these include conspiratorial spaces and tendencies in the united states itself which have come about as result of the unitedstates central american policy i might add that includes slimy films out of hollywood like the one called salvador that they show in some of the communist camps throughout central and south america as a training film for how rotten the united states of america is i saw a movie on cable the other night called no way out excellent movie with this young actor who starred in silverado and the untouchables in the film inside the pentagon of course they did not get permission to shoot over there but they sure built a set that looked like it inside that pentagon and of course liberal writers love to put down homosexual and then give them all sorts of special interest treatment they have the secretary of defense who is having an affair with some young woman they have as his senior aidedecampe a homosexual who hires two guys as thugs to kill the secretary of defenses mistress girlfriend of course how are these people introduced to the movie audience and it is a big success one of the most rented videotapes in america no way out is the film they are described as agency peop a 2ia people who have just come back from central america and the young naval hero the lieutenant commander says you mean these are people who work with the death squads in el salvador and honduras and the guy nods affirmatively so here we have without batting an eye two cia agents he calls them oliver and hardy they are thugs they crash and try to kill people all through the second half of the film it is accepted in hollywood that the cia of course ran the death squads in el salvador and is now setting up death squads in honduras unbelievable so these people understand these communists in central america they have a lot of friends in hollywood then it goes on after another three excellent paragraphs i do not have time to read them all it says our conspiratorial line is by its very nature bound to dialog and negotiated political solutions but the dialog is not the only form of conspiracy it goes on to say dialog is one form of the conspiratorial struggle but we must develop other informal methods that in the moment of opportunity of power can be more or less important than official methods in other words yoko ono lennon all we are saying is give dialog a chance then it goes on to say and we must remember that flexible discussion and proposals are needed to stimulate the conspiracy another couple of valuable paragraphs that i do not have time to read and it says for revolutionary states and in the area of socialization negotiation is an expression of victory to force the united states to negotiate shows that the united states administration is politically weak and cannot mobilize all its efforts and that its policies are internationally isolated i wonder if they learned any of this from vietnam imperialists during negotiations try to make concessions on weak points and try to preserve the other points the concrete expression of this in our case is that there is united states congressional bipartisan support for el salvador but in the case of nicaragua there are deep divisions in the con gress the unity of the united states congress in relation to aid to el salvador will only be broken through strategic advance of the revolutionary movement the time of the united states elections is the most propitious moment to favor this division they are dividing us to conquer us watch the debate on the house floor tomorrow follow it in the written record esquipulas iithat is the socalled arias plan named after the president of costa rica a oneterm 4year president by the way is a concrete expression of the negotiation aspect there is in esquipulas iisometimes referred to as guatemalas most commony now as the arias plan there is in esquipulas ii for imperialism and its strategy for lowintensity conflict finally that expression of ours is making it into the communist documentscongratulations maj andy messing you finally got that expression to be understood the communists always understood it there is in esquipulas ii for inperiallsm and its strategy for lowintensity conflict an aspect which is a mortal game the defeat of the contras would be a grave strategic defeat for the united states especially if we take into account the impact of failure in vietnam and the geopolitical position of central america there is a field comment by our intelligence analysists it is clear from the text that the writer is using contras to refer to the nicaraguan resistance in other words this poor field guy hates to use the name the communists in managua tacked on to the freedom fighters dick nicaraguan resistance however if i ever need this man i will tell him that henry hyde says call them contra tyrants right up there is the seal for virginia it says so always tyrants sic sempere tyranis so let us call them contra tyrants our young freedom fighters it says the failure of the contras this is the communists writing again and the acceptance of the nicaraguan revolution for the united states can be a total global strategic change it would also affect the unitedstates counterionsurgency policy and support to the salvadoran government and right you are mr communist scholar being curried by this young courier right you are if the contras are defeated in nicaragua driven into some bataan death march toward the rio coco river in the north and the san juan river in the south to be picked up by american medical teams so some of our majority colleagues here being humanitarians would pick them tip and bring them to the united states hopefully all of them to move to fort worth and get registered 5 years from now and vote in one of your elections up there let us see what it says continuing here in spite of the bipartisan unity in the case of el salvadorvery fragile only due to this liberal democrat notre dame graduate jose durateit would be very difficult to have to recognize defeat in nicaragua in a global view it would not be politically logical for the unitedstates to take its hands out of nicaragua and place them in el salvador in the form of more military aid do not bet on it for these reasons the esquipulas ii guatemala city arlas wright reagan plan is positive for the revolution the revolutionary forces can use esquipulas ii and mr arias i add thatto divide and break down the opposition the united states can give nothing and needs to beg for everything the popular sandinista revolution has established its rules and we have our own 18 points and 6 points the united states is weak in the interest of time i jump over the next excellent paragraph and it says el salvador is a strategic pilot model for the application of lowintensity conflict methodology for the united states not only because of the geopolitical factor but also because of the characteristics of the model el salvador is a place where the united states broke the classic model of traditional military dictatorship and developed dictatorships of a new type which the united states classifies as democratic processes in other words people going to the voting booth pulling a little curtain and voting in secret they call that a new form of imperialism i jump ahead the failure of the duarte modelotherwise known as democracywould have strategic implications one thing is a revolution which triumphs over a traditional dictatorship another thing would be the fall of a christian democratic government with a reform ethic in other words they are admitting that duartes government is a christian democratic government with a reform ethic and they want to make it fail because that is an advancement for what we used to call around here godlessgetting redundantatheistic communism i jump through some tremendous material here which will be in the record the longer the war continues the more favorable is the situation for the revolutionary forces that is vietnam french or american model the bourgeoisie does not have prospects for resolving the economic crises and the internal contradictions of the situation tend to deepen all this causes the imperialists to have less control and more instability and then we came to page 8 you have got to read this my fellow american citizens in its totality the united states has started to display fissures in unity yes sir right in this chamber diverse factors have created this fissure including tiredness of the length of the warbecause we are an impatient peoplethe destruction the impossibility of winning and the realization that the war is an integral phenomenon based on economic political and social difficulties break the back of the communist forces of terror as we did in the tet offensive and then a distinguished american walter cronkite says ive had it a few years later he says on the air i heard him say this with my own ears i am no longer going to call the enemy forces in vietnam communist forces red forces i am going to call them only

i took a 1 minute and talked about the misinformation that i believe is being given to the american people regarding the aids issue in florida today and in other parts of the country some religious organizations and other organizations are giving out information and condoms telling people that there is such a thing as safe sex the fact of the matter is that the aids virus the aids epidemic that we are facing right now in this country and around the world does not give us much latitude there is no such thing outside a monogomous relationship such as safe sex any longer any young person any married person any old person who involves themselves with another person that they do not have a lifelong experience with runs the risk of getting aids it is like playing russian roulette there has been a lot of information given out by the media by the surgeon general and others regarding the aids virus in fact the surgeon general and others have advocated the use of condoms as a step toward controlling the aids virus the fact of the matter is there is no foolproof method i said earlier today there are approximately 240 million aids viruses that can fit on a period at the end of a sentence so if you have contact with someone who has that aids virus you run the risk of getting it no matter what preventative measure you may employ i am not the only one who is saying this in fact i have gleaned the information i have from a number of sources i would like to read to you a letter that i received from dr robertson who is with the research and development corp in lexington ga he has done extensive research on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and i think everybody in america ought to know about this so that there is no misinformation o 1350 as we gain more information as time goes by it is going to be important that we take the steps that are necessary to protect the vast majority of the population from this epidemic this dread disease dr bowen the head of hhs said not long ago in a speech that tens of millions of people are going to die from aids the way it is going it could be more than that it is the worst plague to hit the world since the black plague and it may be the worst ever it is estimated right now that 4 million people in the united states alone have the virus within their systems it is doubling every 8 to 12 months which means that the attitudes of the american people do not change rapidly so next year there will be 4 to 8 million the following year there will be 8 to 16 million and the year after that there will be 16 to 32 million who are infected with the disease or who at least have the virus within their systems and so on there have been articles written saying that sometime within 12 years onefourth of the unitedstates population would have the virus within their systems and that may be conservative i would like to read this letter now it gets a little technical but i think most people if they will listen closely will glean from this letter what it really means the text of the letter is as follows dear mr burton i am writing in response to your telephone call today when you asked whether there might be a risk of transmission of the aids virus hivi other than by sexual intercourse homosexual acts the use of blood or blood products or during pregnancy and birth the answer to this question is yes the most pressing problem is that we cannot measure the risk though we can set some limits i will expand my answer in two waysfirst by telling you why one must be cautious in reaching any conclusions about the disease or its transmission and second by telling you why there is cause for concern about transmission by the nontraditional routes the most important source of information is the tabulation of aids cases reported to the centers for disease control these reports must be interpreted carefully since they represent disease diagnosed a long time after infection with hiv since there is no mechanism for collecting or reporting information about the development of antibodies to hiv or knowledge of infection and its routes is limited for example the majority of those coming down with aids male homosexuals in california drug addicts in new york come from the population first infected in this country but their proportions in the epidemic do not represent the proportions in the same groups infected now in contrast recent army data show that in some parts of new york there is an equal rate of infection amongst male and female applicants this will be reflected in aids cases reported in several years time these delays led many people to assume that aids would remain a disease exclusively a largely of homosexuals heterosexual spread of hiv in the united states has only recently been generally accepted with the publication of clear case reports although the epidemiological evidence has been strong for some time there have always been cases which could not be classifed into the known risk groups these represent a roughly constant 3 of the total when other categories of risk e g consorting with a prostitute are excluded this is not to say that these 3 acquired the virus casually but it does say that the unknown category is increasing roughly in step with the epidemic as a whole obviously there could be several explanations for this none of which can be excluded without considerable further study in particular if casual transmission were possible it would be difficult to prove without largescale prospective studies of the risks of associating with infected individuals studies to date are too small to exclude a risk though they may set limits on it indeed some appear to demonstrate a risk but again they are too small for us to be sure in this context it is important to remember that it is only recently that it has become clear that the risk of heterosexual transmission is roughly equal to the risk of homosexual transmission as is the risk of transmission from man to woman and from woman to man the early apparent differences in the risk of transmission by these routes appear to be accounted for by the delays in infection spreading to each group they are not real differences thus if transmission by nontraditional methods is either possible or likely it is only now with the virus quite widespread that we are likely to obtain good epidemiological evidence as was true for the traditional routes of transmission the first acceptable evidence of nontraditional transmission will come from case reports in which all other routes have been eliminated it is disturbing that we do in fact have several such cases reports these include transmission without sexual intercourse between an elderly couple whose only intimate contact was kissing transmission from a nursing mother to her child possibly in breast milk transmission between two young brothers by an unknown route and transmission between a patient and a neighbor who was nursing him it is likely that case reports of this kind will become more frequent as the general population becomes more heavily infected with the virus on the other hand without knowledge of the prevalence of seropositivitythat is of the number of infectious peoplein an environment it will be hard to detect transmission in say the workplace until the virus is quite prevalent as it will be in several years unless transmission is reduced now here we must for the moment rely on our theoretical knowledge of hiv and similar viruses as well as on what information we can glean from the case reports to hand hiv belongs to the family of retroviruses and the subfamily lentivlrinae the lentviruses are known to infect ungulates and primates by several routes including aerosols and even hiv has apparently spread from one chimpanzee to its cagemate without sexual contact in addition all the lentiviruses evolve rapidly so that their envelope proteins which contain the sites that recognise and blind to receptors on the cells they infect are very variable leading to the possibility of variation in infectiousness as is found in hiv as well as in specificity which might also lead to a variation in the efficiency of different routes of infection it is prudent therefore to assume that hiv can share these properties since it is extremely closely related to the other lentiviruses particularly in view of the fact that hiv can be found in most bodily secretions and excretions including urine tears and saliva as well as breast milk blood and semen hiv is also much tougher than had been thought being capable of surviving with undiminished infectiousness for at least two weeks at room temperature if damp there are therefore strong theoretical grounds for caution these grounds supply a possible february 19 1 987 basis for the transmission of the virus in those cases of nontraditional infection already reported and are cause for growing caution as the virus becomes more prevalent leading to an increasing number of contacts with infected people in the traditional modes of transmission it appears to be the case that risk per exposure is constant with infection becoming increasingly likely with an increasing number of exposures the analogy between the transmission of hepatitisb and aids has often been drawn the cdc recommend that hepatitisb precautions be taken to minimize the spread of hiv in the health care setting it seems that the routes of transmission are very similar but that the hepatitisb virus is more infectious than hiv in other words it is reasonable to expect that more cases of hiv transmission between household members will occur as prolonged exposure to hiv carriers becomes more common it will be much more difficult to detect transmission by these means outside the household without welldesigned prospective epidemlological studies the studies reported to date have been too limited to allow any conclusion other than that casual transmission is probably not easy we should remember however that this was said at first for heterosexual transmission of the virus though now we know that it is easy indeed the case reports we have are extremely strong evidence of transmission within the household and cannot be rebutted by the limited epidemlological studies of household transmission even amongst trained healthcare personnel there are cases of transmission that cannot be accounted for by riskgroup membership again all we can say is that transmission in the healthcare setting is not very likely at the moment we cannot say that it is impossible in an attachment to this letter i list the main points and give references to the most important papers copies of which are also attached my considered opinion is that transmission by contact within the family happens and that casual transmission is possible but that we have too few data to determine how efficient each casual route is some routes of transmission are not likely at all for example it does not seem possible for enough virus to be transmitted by mosquito though it is possible that other insect vectors in warm climates could play a role we simply have no direct evidence of insect transmission and what evidence we have suggests that if it plays a role at all in the tropics it is a very limited one transmission by coughing or sneezing is clearly possible in theory but does not yet seem to be likely if it were likely then we would expect to see a fillingin of the age distribution of those infected with the virus this could be happening since we have little information about the prevalence of infection by age group but if it is it has not yet affected the agedistribution of aids cases in the united states again this tells us the population at large the traditional routes are more efficient transmitters than the casual routes however i believe that there are more serious issues than the question of casual transmission one statistic illustrates this well it is likely that at least 4 million americans are infected by the virus we will not know the true number unless we perform widespread blood testing or until those infected begin to develop aids study of relatively small groups here and abroad shows that infection spreads rapidly through a population saturating it in about 58 years very roughly there is a doubling time for prevalence of infection of no more than a year if we accept this conservative estimate then there will be 4 million new infections in the united states in 1987 this is a daily rate of over 10 000 and just exceeds the annual number of live births in the united states even if only 2 million are now infected this statistic will be true in a years time if more are in fact infected now then we are already exceeding the number of live births with the number of new hiv infections since we now know that at least 50 of those infected will develop aids and then die and in fact have no reason to assume that this will not be the case for all or nearly all of those infected the situation is already extremely grave this is particularly true because what evidence we have suggests that no actions taken to date have had any measurable effect on the spread of the epidemic and because actions that are likely to be taken in the near future depend solely on changes in behavior in people who do not even know that they are infected with hiv and do not consider themselves at risk such behavioral change has not occurred in the past under these or any other circumstances without regulatory force to back it up the prognosis is therefore grim and relatively little time is left if we are to have any hope of controlling the epidemic in the united states we certainly cannot afford to wait for an

remember he was criticized strongly by somoza he said the mass for the sandinista government when they took over he was the one who negotiated commandante ortegas release from prison and here is an individual who was supportive as many in this body and many on our side of the aisle originally were supportive of the original revolution since that time it has become a communist dicatatorship now how does this fit in what point and the gentleman and the gentleman from connecticut and the gentleman from california have covered the other points it leads me to the major point that i want to make in 1938 there was a gentleman in this country named whittaker chambers who was a communist he was a member of the communist party here in the united states whittaker chambers became repelled by what he saw in the communist party the executions that took place in soviet russia and many other things he left the communist party in 1937 in 1948 he testified in many congressional hearings which resulted in the conviction of alger hiss who later went to prison in 1952 this is a man who was a communist whittaker chambers wrote a book the book is called witness now i would encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read this book it is a very profound book and tells a story for today let me read the first page from whittaker chambers book witness he said in 1937 like lazarus lazarus from the bible who came back from the dead i began like lazarus the impossible return i began to break away from communism and to climb from deepwithin its underground where for 6 years i had been been buried back into the world of free men when we dead awaken i used to sometimes say in those days to my wife who though never a communist had shared my revolutionary hopes and was now to share my ordeals when we dead awaken for this title of an ibsen play i have never read somehow caught and summed up for me feelings that i could not find any other words to expressfears uncertalnities selfdoubts cowardices flinchings of the willnature to any man who undertakes to reverse in midcourse the journey of his life at the same time he said when he left communism i felt a surging release and a sense of freedom like a man who bursts at last gasp out of a drowning sea this elation was not caused and this is the frightening thing of the book this elation was not caused by any comparison of the world i was leaving and the world i was returning to whittaker chambers went on to say by any hardheaded estimate the world i was leaving that is the communist world looked like the world of life and of the future the world i was returning to that is freedom and democracy the world i was returning to seemed by contrast a graveyard it was in fact the same world i had abandoned as hopeless when i joined the communist party in 1925 only now its crisis which few men could diagnose 13 years before had reached the visible brink of catastrophe and still that stricken world did not know the nature of the catastrophe it still did not know or even want to know two facts that it must know to survive the meaning of communism and the meaning of the new breed of man the communist whittaker chambers went on to say i wanted my wife to realize clearly one longterm penalty for herself and for the children of the step i was taking i said you know we are leaving the winning world for the losing world i meant that in the revolutionary conflict of the 20th century i knowingly chose the side of probable defeat almost nothing that i have observed or that has happened to me since has made me think that i was wrong about that forecast but nothing has changed my determination to act as if i were wrongif only because in the last instance men must act on what they believe right not on what they believe probable since whittaker chambers wrote those words in 1952 19 countries have turned communist cambodia laos vietnam mozambique ethiopia angola cuba now nicaragua and i do not believe and i think we should do everything to see that it is the case i do not believe that whittaker chambers was right i think this body republicans and democrats and americans should do everything they can in their power to prove that when whittaker chambers says that when he was leaving communism he was leaving the winning side and joining the losing side as the father of five children who are going to have to live in this world long after i depart this troubles me deeply now to be opposed to contra aid and i would reprimand myself and the h 1174 co other members for using the word contra because contra means against it is a negative word i think a more appropriate word is to call the people in nicaragua who are called contras call them the democratic resistance or freedom fighters or something like that but to oppose aid to the freedom fighters in nicaragua is not a policy it is an abrogation it is just saying i dont know what to do but im not going to do anything now i happen to think that president arias of costa rica has come out with a very good plan a good idea i think this country the united states should support president arias in what he is trying but in order to support president arias and make these negotiations to be successful it is necessary to put pressure on the communist sandinista government in nicaragua because if we do not have pressure on that government they will never abide by negotiations and met with arias and duarte and the other members i just want to urge my colleagues here you may want to cut off aid later on in the semester or later on in the year perhaps but to do it now would basically doom president arias negotiations a vote to cut off aid to the freedom fighters or contras or democratic resistance would i think spell

side of nicaragua they will have a stranglehold over the panama canal now i was in the panama canal just a couple of days ago i went down and took a look at the lock system i went the entire length of the canal one cruise missile from a soviet attack submarine into the lock system of the panama canal will stop our traffic will destroy the lock system and will keep our boats our ships from traveling through the panama canal that is a major port of americas commerce now i have a lot of friends who have large farming areas i have a large farming area myself i know we have heard that it has been very difficult for farming communities in the midwest for example when they are undergoing tough economic times to understand why it is important to be concerned about that part of the world one reason they should be concerned is that about 50 percent of the exports the grain that is sold for export from their farming communities goes through that canal and now if it does not go through the canal i asked one of the people at the canal one of the executives i said what happens if you dont go through the canal he said then you have to go all the way around south america one affect that that has on our grain markets is that then perhaps it will go to different customers because our grain is going to be more expensive than it would be if it went through the canal the point is that everybody in america who makes a living and depends to some degree on export whether you are farmer manufacturer et cetera has an interest in the panama canal that is why the american people acted so fervently when jimmy carter gave away the panama canal they knew they knew even if they were not intellectualizing about it even if they did not have a complete intellectual or technical analysis of it they knew the panama canal was fundamental to our economic system and that is why they did not want it to go they probably were right because general noriega is tearing the country up in panama now we are going to have a very difficult time there but to go back to the gentlemans position the soviet military that is operating that is strategizing the policy for communist nicaragua realizes that when they complete the ports the naval bases at corinto and el bluff they will have a stranglehold over the panama canal in world war ii adolf hitler sunk more american tonnage at the panama canal right at the mouth of the canal than in the entire atlantic it is a very vulnerable area you know one thing that impressed me today about the liberals who stood up and were upset with colonel norths

becoming a reality if we never mention the 600 million dollars worth of tanks and attack aircraft and bullets and guns that the soviets are stuffing into nicaragua it will all go away and in our own minds we can way well those are just simple peasant folks down there who want a little bit better life they are a socialist government a communist government but they are not going to bother us but i find it interesting that the democrats in this house absolutely are unable to deal with the idea that the soviet union is moving into nicaragua and if the gentleman has a second slide there i think that is even more important than the first one now this is marshal ogarkov on communism in latin america now this statement by marshal ogarkov is this and it was taken back from the grenadan defense minister in 1983 when grenada was communist the grenadan defense minister went for some of his training in some of his meetings to moscow and met withmarshal ogarkov then the head of all the soviet military forces he met with him and wrote about his meetings and came back and in the grenadan papers that we captured when we took grenada for freedom we captured 26 000 pounds of documents we found this one document from the grenadan communist defense minister who was talking about his visit with marshal ogarkov in moscow he said marshal ogarov said these words over two decades ago there was

limit medicares reimbursement of hospital capitalrelated expenses to support of only those institutions and services which are truly needed capital expenditures by hospitals appear to be out of control over the last 5 years with an increase in inflation of 17 percent as measured by the gnp deflator expenditures by medicare to reimburse hospitals for their capital expenditures rose 76 percent looking at it another way fixed assets per hospital bedoften referred to as bricks and mortar rose about 12 percent per year while total assetsincluding moveable equipmentrose about 14 percent annually moreover if no action is taken medicares aggregate payments to hospitals are estimated to rise by an annual average rate of 11 percent between 1989 and 1993 this will raise medicare capital payments per case from 482 to 661 an increase of 37 percent these increases will occur while use of hospital facilities reaches ever higher levels of inefficiency average occupancy for hospitals is now just over 64 percent for staffed beds having dropped from a level of about 75 percent over the last decade in other words over onethird of the hospital beds in the nation which are staffed are standing idle every single day what is perhaps most disturbing is that 54 percent of all hospitals have an occupany rate below 50 percent and only 5 percent of hospitals have an occupancy rate above 80 percent the cost of these empty beds is startling the administrations private sector initiative known as the grace commission estimated that each of these empty staffed beds cost 40 000 per year a conservative estimate based upon 1979 costs nevertheless this estimate produces a total of almost 14 billion in wasted resources equipment and services have been proliferating at a very high rate as well in many cases hospitals have expanded services beyond the capacity which can be sustained leading to situations in which the volume of service provided is below the level necessary to maintain the competence of the staff this is especially true with respect to cardiac care for example in arizona the relaxation of capital expenditure review laws has led to an increase in the number of open heart surgery units from 7 to 17 in just 2 years during this period charges for open heart surgery increased 50 percent of much greater concern is that an investigation by an arizona newspaper revealed that death rates for openheart patients in phoenix jumped sharply after capital reviews were dropped the highest mortality rates were found in hospitals which on average did not meet the minimum volume standard of 200 procedures per year generally accepted as the level necessary to mnintain competence these hospitals suffered a mortality rate twice that of the group of hospitals above the minimum volume the normal rules of economics do not appear to apply in any meaningful way to hospitals a good example of this has occurred in houston tx which has been suffering through a recession related to the drop in oil prices since a capital expenditure review law was relaxed in 1985 nine new hospitals have opened there is currently 1 5 billion in hospital construction in progress and occupancy rates in houston have fallen from 75 percent prior to deregulation to below 60 percent today in houston hospital expansion is going forward notwithstanding the fact that the communitys ability to pay for more and more hospital facilities is severely constrained hospital capital expenditures ignore the normal rules of economics in another important respect as well more capacity to provide more services does not lower prices as it does in other areas of the economyit simply raises volume and expenditures health economists discovered some time ago a phenomenon called the roomer effect that is the more hospital beds and services built the more hospital beds and services used study after study have confirmed that hospital utilization rates are higher when the supply of beds and services is high therefore the high rate of excess capacity in beds and services leads directly to unnecessary admissions and procedures given the high rate of expansion of specialized cardiac units it is not surprising that a recent article in the journal of the american medical administration found that 14 percent of heart bypass surgery was unnecessary and 30 percent was questionable bypass operations doubled from 137 000 in 1980 to 284 000 in 1986 the socalled procompetitive health care strategy employed by the administration has paid insufficient attention to questions surrounding access to hospital services although we have clearly overinvested in the hospital industry many hospitals including public hospitals and those serving the indigent are undercapitalized we have failed in our attempts to regionalize expensive tertiary services such as intensive neonatal care and bum units we have developed adequate trauma networks in only two states and many developed in other states including my own state of california are now falling apart protecting access to hospital services in the nations rural areas demands our special attention average occupancy in rural hospitals has dropped from 52 percent in 1983 te below 40 percent in 1988 occupancy has been decreasing the fastest in the smallest hospitals rural hospitas with less than 100 beds these data suggest that rural patients are voting with their teat and driving the extra miles to obtain care at the nearest regional hospital with its broader range of services no amount of throwing additional money at these small rural hospitals through increases in the pps rates will assure their survival in the face of this phenomenon what is needed is a creative effort in every region of the country to find ways to assure access and to redefine the role small rural hospitals will play in a wellplanned rational system of rural health care the question of how to reimburse hospitals for their capital costs and how to restrict unnecessary capital expenditures has occupied a great deal of attention in the congress over the last few years the prospective payment system was adopted in 1903 as the method of hospital operating cost payment payment for capitalrelated expenses was not included in pps due to uncertainty about the impact of including capital reimbursement in the system capital continues to be reimbursed on a retrospective costbased system congress directed the secretary of health and human services to study and report to the congress on a proposal to include capital in the prospective payment system the report was submitted in march 1986 proposing a system for capital costs which would pay hospitals a flat amount per medicare admission based upon the actual national average capital payment per admission at that point in time this system was to be implemented october 1 1986 given concerns about the impact of this proposal on specific hospitals congress first delayed its implementation until october 1 1987 and then again until october 1 1991 during the same period based upon promises that market competition would slow the medical arms race the administration successfully ended federal support for capital review programs this has left us with the worst of both worlds on the one hand we have in effect told the states that we no longer care about their efforts to restrain hospital capital expenditures leaving 14 states to drop their capital review programs while many others focus on reviews of nursing homes where the states have a much more direct financial interest on the other hand we have retained a retrospective costbased reimbursement system which creates distortions which demand correction the retrospective costbased or cost passthrough system assures that hospital managers will be insensitive to interest rates or to less expensive alternative methods of financing because cost based reimbursement exceeds actual costs in the first several years after a capital project is put into service costbased reimbursement includes strong incentives to begin new projects this leads hospitals to invest in facilities that are not needed by the population served thereby creating additional excess capacity the passthrough also creates strong incentives to substitute capital for labor or other operating costs particularly as operating cost reimbursement is controlled through prospective payment and capital payments are not medicares present reimbursement methodology contains another perverse feature as well medicare pays hospitals for capital based on medicares proportionate share of inpatient services provided by the hospital the approach is insensitive to whether or not the hospital is full or half empty for example if a 400bed hosptial has half of its beds filled by medicare patients and half filled by nonmedicare patients medicare will pay for about half of the hospitals capital costs however if the same hospital has one quarter of its beds filled with medicare patiunts one quarter with nonmedicare patients and onehalf of its beds empty medicare will stid pay half of the capital costs for its entire plant in essence medicare is subsidizing the hospital for its empty beds i have argued in the past that the best way to deal with th s set of problems is to pay hospitals a single rate for both capital and operating costs based upon average costs per admission adjusted for case mix labor costs and other factors unfortunately this proposal has engendered the violent opposition of the hospital industry and has not been enacted wide variation in hospitalspecific capital costs has also raised questions about the effect such a proposal may have on access to individual hospitals the proposed legislation i am introducing today is an effort to provide a comprehensive response to the various issues surrounding the capital expenditure dilemma it represents an effort to balance between the need to provide appropriate incentives within individual hospitals versus the need to guide the entire hospital care delivery system in an efficient manner taking into account the populations need for services my proposal requires each state with an urban hospital occupancy rate below 85 percent and a rural occupancy rate below 75 percent to establish a system to review and approve the capital expendifures of new hospitals which cost more than 1 million or which create new beds or services if the state did not create such a system medicare would not reimburse hospitals in the state for their capital expinditures in response to those who would point out that capital expenditure review systems have not been as effective as we had hoped in the past my bill provides the essential missing ingredient in assuring the success of these programsan overall limit on capital expenses against which competing proposals can be evaluated the bill imposes a limit on the amount of new capital which can be approved annually in a state equal to the amount medicare would have spent on fixed assets if payments were made on a per admission basis reimbursement for the capital expenses of fixed assets would continue on a cost basis for both old and new capital reimbursement for moveable equipment would be on an allowance basis with the allowance based upon the average proportion of total cost attributable to capital costs for moveable equipment in fiscal year 1987 the allowance would be phased in over 3 years septem ber 7 1988 the capital target for fixed assets would be derived from the proportion of total medicare reimbursement represented by average capita costs in fiscal year 1987 the target would increase each year as medicare admissions and the hospital update factor increase the secretary would be authorized to make exceptions and provide adjustments as needed in order to assure that the capital expendilure review process is based upon an explicit assessment of the need for investment in health care in a state the bill requires each state to develop an inpatient hospital plan the plan would address access to hospital facilities identification of hospitals and parts of hospitals which should close in order to reach the occupancy targets regionalization of inpatient services the special needs of public and other disproportionate share hospitals and the special needs of aids patients the bill would treat rural facilities differently from urban facilities in recognition of the unique circumstances facing rural hospitals the states would not be required to review the capital expenses of rural hospitals if the state developed a plan for rural health the plan would provide a strategy for stabilization of rural health care through regionalizatlon of services development of alternatives to traditional inpatient hospital facilities and recognition of the unique transportation needs of rural communities regarding both emergency and nonemergency health needs an important component of my bill is that it would allow governors to despignate local review agencies to provide for review of capital investment proposals at the local or regional level i have included this provision notwithstanding the problems in coordination which have o curred in the past with similar structures because i believe something very important has been lost in the health care system over the last several years with all the talk about competition and market share health is a community affair one about which everyone in a community ought to have a right to speak decisions about hospital care are not ones which should be closely held in the powerful hands of administrators doctors or trustees we should have a forum in which communities may debate the future of health care in that community after all well over half the revenue of hosptials is derived from public sources it seems unreasonable to deny the public the right to debate capital investment decisions supported by their own money my bill would allow but not require the designation of agencies at the local level to perform this role reimbursement of capital costs is the most important remaining area in which the congress has not reached consensus regarding medicare hospital payment policy my bill ropresents an effort to provide a new approach which mixes the best of the old and the new in order to provide a reasonable orderly response to the need for a hospital capital investment policy a summary of the bill follows"], [0.00015932321548461914, 0.00015932321548461914,

states in cuba the soviet union has a port of call for its submarines from cuba the soviet union monitors united states communications using one of the largest and most effective electronic surveillance sites in the world cuban troops act as soviet surrogates in ethiopia and angola the cuban government smuggles arms and provides aid and training to guerrillas and terrorists throughout the western hemisphere in the event of a conventional war in europe or in the persian gulf cuba would constitute a threat to our ability to aid our allies and defend our strategic interests in those vital regions the secretary also said we risked nuclear confrontation with the soviet union over the removal of their missiles from cuba today we must spend billions of dollars to strengthen our counterintelligence apparatus and our naval and air defenses against soviet use of an island 90 miles off our shore and we learned the value of such an outpost to the soviet union which spends and i

they were both closed now this is being brought up on suspension and you know it is beginning to look like we are never going to get a chance as members to offer any kind of amendments that may really need to be considered i am also very much concerned about that process that has been used here there have not been hearings there are a lot of questions that need to be answered for instance it really bothers me that this transfer of this 50 million for homeless will be taken out of the fema funds since i am from an area that is prone to have disastersnot necessarily at this time of the year but at other times of the yeari really worry about their ability to respond to a major disaster then i have the question what about the traditional assistance programs for the poor why are they not taking care of these homeless needs housing needs it is not as if we have not had a considerable amount of assistance going into that area fema has received 370 million for its emergency food and shelter program since 1983 millions of other dollars have gone into such programs as usdas emergency feeding program a billion dollars in surplus commodities since 1982 50 million a year for distribution costs and 75 million for emergency feeding centers then you have the hhs program for runaway and homeless youth 23 million general revenue sharing goes to cities and states they could use that money for this purpose blockgrant funds so it is not as if we have been ignoring the problem in this particular area i also wonder since this was just done in the committee on appropriations have we had adequate hearings have we really looked into it who are these people do they really want to be brought in off the streets ther e is also a constitutional question here the courts have ruled that we cannot go out and just take these people and force them into housing how do you address that question but the main concern that i have is that this is another crash program and when you have crash programs like this even though there is a time sensitivity here you tend to make a mess for instance just this past sunday there was a frontpage article in a local newspaper that pointed out that there are at least 12 apartments in washington dc for the homeless that are being paid for to the tune of 3 078 a month3 078 a month for 1 apartment and there are at least 12 of from contractors and

committee on agriculture we rise in strong support of h r 3435 the charitable assistance and food bank support act of 1987 this bill was reported out of the committee on agriculture unanimously and enjoys bipartisan support hl11381 in addition a number of charities including the unitedstates catholic conference have indicated their support for this legislation the purpose of h r 3435 is to correct two inequities in thetreatment of atypical income received by certain households participating in the food stamp program the bill also authorizes demonstration projects to test new expanded ways of distributing surplus agriculture products through food banks the first provision would amend the food stamp act so that small charitable contributions which are given to poor people particularly at holidays do not count as income in determining benefits under the food stamp program this provision is especially appropriate as we approach the holiday season when many communities have private charity campaigns in which small cash donations are provided to the needy for the purchase of food gifts or other items unfortunately section 5 d 1 of the food stamp act while it does allow for this kind of gift deductions does not do the same with regard to cash contributions this is a time of year when those who are more fortunate in our society have traditionally been called upon to help the needy we are a generous society and community efforts of this kind are usually successful we all recognize the problem of hunger and homelessness in our society is a national shame and requires cooperation to deal with it at the federal state and local levels as well as the private sector we encourage the private sector to establish efforts to provide assistance in this time of need but it is frustrating for those who do wish to help to see their contributions offset by inflexible federal regulations it does not make sense to me to discourage such contributions in this way instead we should be encouraging this outpouring of holiday spirit the problem in the current law was brought to my attention last year when the monterey peninsula herald conducted a campaign operation christmas to get subscribers to donate money to help needy families over the holidays the donors and the recipients were both justifiably outraged when they discovered that this altruism caused cuts in welfare benefits to correct the problem in the food stamp program this bill provides that up to 300 in a 3month period would be excluded from income if this amount represents nonrecurring cash donations based on need that are received from one or more private nonprofit charitable organizations cbo estimates the cost of the charity disregard to be less than 500 000 a year this bill will also correct a bureaucratic problem which has come to light in the food stamp program the food and nutrition service interprets the food stamp act as requiring that any payment which a food stamp recipient receives for providing his or her blood must be counted in determining food stamp benefits i personally think it is tragic that some people find themselves in such desperate straits that they have to sell their blood if the money they get from selling their own blood causes their food stamp benefits to be cut the inequity iscompounded at a time when there is obviously a need for blood contributions it is tragic to discourage these contributions but it is actually more tragic when a person receives payment for their contribution to have it deducted from their benefits the purpose of this provision is to correct that correction of this inequity will cost 1 million a year the third provision would authorize the department of agriculture to carry out at least one food bank demonstration project using section 32 commodities my distinguished colleague and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on domestic marketing nutrition and consumer relations bill emerson and i held a hearing on food banks earlier this year in missouri at that hearing we received impressive testimony about the capability of food banks to meet emergency nutrition needs we came away from that hearing convinced that we should test ways to increase the flexibility of the food banks cbo advises that the cost of operating this demonstration would be 200 000 a year the cost is kept low because the department of agriculture will use commodities that are already available for donation under section 32 of the agriculture adjustment act of 1935 the house approved this demonstration earlier this year when we considered the commodity distribution reform act of 1987 h r 1340 we have included in h r 3435 the exact language already approved by the house to ensure that

1987 h r 3435 we want to get this legislation over to the other body and work to get it enacted into law before christmas so that the good work of local charities across the country will not be

international relief organizations operating inside nicaragua there are no organizations operating inside nicaragua that are not under the control or direction or both of the sandinista marxist

rail mobile midgetman we are choosing from recommendations that have been laid before us by the scoweroft commission this is not something that we came up with on our own there is an emerging threat

consistency of those who believe that in the next decade we and our adversaries may indeed have deployed strategic defense systems the best response to strategic defenses to boost phase interceptors and postboost phase interceptors is to cut down the operating time for the boost and for the postboost phases this system a singlewarhead system carries the capability of reducing these phases to a far greater extent than the mx missile at 190 000 pounds with 10 warheads in the postboost phase alone this system can probably offload its reentry vehicles in 1 to 11 2 minutes the actual number is classified but there are estimates recently published by lawrence livermore laboratory to the effect that our systems can offload rvs somewhere around at 45 seconds again that is an estimated number i am not revealing anything classified this midgetman system with two warheads would offload its rvs in 45 seconds to 1 2 minutes as opposed to possibly 7 minutes for the postboost phase of an mx missile that makes the midgetman superior not o liy because of its mobility and the fact that it presents 250 missiles to target in the postboost phase but also because in the postboost phase its of fload and its rvs faster therefore the midgetman is much more survivable in the world that some project toward the end of the next decade when strategic defenses may be factored into the strategic equation this is another reason to vote for the mavroules amendment and support the midgetman unitedstates mobility and dispersion will not only make it more survivable versus the ss18 and ss19 but

word aegis comes from the greekmeaning shield and that is what the aegis is for the unitedstates navy the aegis is the navys answer to the air force awacs planes the stateoftheart integration of computers radars missiles and software of the aegis provides an unprecedented level of protection to naval battle groups the aegis is one of the key underpinnings of americas new high technology navy the numbers of the united states fleet are still below 600 surface combatant ships which is a far cry from the over 2 000ship soviet navy the unitedstates navy holds its own because of superior electronics and design if the soviets had the same technology and if they used it the sheer weight of numbers would favor the soviets in any possible confrontation that is why technology transfer to any country concerns me but in view of the recent toshiba scandal transfers of technology worry me greatly the toshiba incident highlighted the fact that japanese compaines have been trafficking for years with the soviets and from what i understand other japanese companies are under investigation for being conduits to the soviets of american military secrets in response to the united states demands the japanese have promised to tighten security yet this is a promise we have heard before but what has happened the japanese diet refuses to pass an antlespionage law history has shown that the japanese are long on promises but short on performance the book the japanese conspiracy which i have been reading on the floor catalogs promise after promise made broken and replaced by a new promise can the united states leave its defenses to mere promises americans deserve better how can we in congress justify 300 billion in defense spending but not at the same time safeguard the secrets that are necessary to insure our defense further why should foreigners be subject to differentand laxer espionage laws than americans the people who release our secrets should be prosecuted under american lan in american courts is this unreasonable in an analogous situation india is trying to extradite united states union carbide officials for criminal prosecution should united states secrets that involve the very defense of our country and the lives of our military be treated in a lesser manner but beyond the security aspects there are economic reasons also to build a frigate with aegis capabilities costs somewhere in the neighborhood of 750 million in the united states in japan this same ship would cost an additional 200 million if the japanese used prevailing united states contracting officer logic there would be no question that it would be purchased in the united statesbecause its cheaper over here i had hoped that the other body was going to hold firm that the aegis could be sold to japan only if the entire unit was built in the united states but that apparently is not to be but the japanese want somethingthe technology the united states makes the best surface combatant ship in the world the japanese want to learn the knowhow of the way a modern fighting ship is built but beyond that there is the question of the software in the past 10 years the japanese have shot past the united states in microchips and small computers the united states is still the worlds acknowledged leader in software can we really afford to give this to a competitor in the world market the japanese have already taken advantage of the f15 technology to leap frog from a propellor plane industry into production of commercial jets yesterday former senator jeremiah denton a retired navy admiral and more respected vietnam prisoner of war told me that he and other military experts were shocked to learn that the united states would turn over such technology it also happens that the aegis cruiser and its technology were the speciality of senator denton when he was on active duty and more than one expert has stated that the technology could be reverse engineered and within 3 to 4 years put to use in parallel civilian ways as well as military production so why is the united states doing this and what happens to the american shipyard workers who could have stayed employed but for the fact the 2 or more aegis cruisers would be built in japan we should retain our aegisour shield the greeks used to say return with your shield or on it and united states sailors and united states shipyardworkers will not be able to return with their shield if that shield is in japan"], [0.008512914180755615, 0.5085129141807556, 1, "as the irancontra hearings have unfolded there has been a great deal of talk about protecting the presidency as if the presidency operates in some vacuum and has some intrinsic value unto itself the presidency only is significant and important within the context of our democratic form of government our commitment to the rule of law and our commitment to a constitutional form of government the issue is not protecting the presidency as i see it the issue is protecting our democratic way of life our commitment to the rule of law and our commitment to the constitution if there is no accountability where are the prophylactic remedies if there is no accountability what about a commitment to law if there is no accountability what about a commitment to a constitutional form of government if the congress of the united states is to be rendered null and void and impotent in the context of our form of government what about a commitment to a constitutional form of government again if this 200 years is not to be a sham celebration on the issue of a commitment to a constitutional form of government then i would suggest that we turn our concern away from simply the question of protecting the presidency and begin to ro5tect our democratic way of life finally i would say are we witnessing a period a moment in our history when we have to begin to redefine the notion of accountability redefine the issue of check and balance redefine what we mean by perjury and finally redefine what we mean by presidential pardon does that mean that the courts of the united states are not significant and important does that mean that the congress of the united states is not a relevant branch of government does that mean that all one has to do is be the president and be the king of the united states i suggest that is an

against the bill unless it is substantially modified this is a gag rule it is designed to choke off opposition not to allow opposition i am somewhat shocked and some what troubled that we are proceeding under this kind of process i am somewhat surprised even that the gentle man whose name appears at the top of this bill who has often said in this house that we ought to have full debate on these issues would be in favor of a process like this one which is aimed at really undermining the ability for opposition to have their say this bill and this process is a complete break of faith with those of us who 2 years ago attempted to reach out and build a working coalition toward a bipartisan policy to bring out activism against apartheid in south africa i will tell the members of this body that there is no one action i have taken in congress that has caused me more problems with my base political constituency than my attempts a couple of years ago to work with the people here to come up with a policy that conservatives and liberals could support against apartheid we tried to help build and in all honesty even during that process we were frustrated but we stuck with you and in the final analysis many conservatives voted for that antiapartheid action what did we get for it were we consulted about this bill this time no no there was no consultation with us we were out of the process did our attempts 2 years ago to try to build a bipartisan policy toward something to really help the people in south africa mean anything obviously not this bill in fact moves us away from that which conservatives were trying to achieve 2 years ago it moves us away from an activist policy within south africa to end apartheid and substitutes instead a policy of washing our hands of the situation and walking out on south africa the gentleman from missouri a couple of moments ago said america will not watch from afar pass the dellums bill and we will watch from afar we will not have any more involvement in south africa we will be out we will have to watch the process from afar and the tragedy that comes after it we are not talking now about policy here as some of the members have said before me we are talking about politics i am sad to say that i have learned the hard way that there are politicians in america more interested in pursuing domestic political agenda than in really helping oppressed people i intend to vote for the substitute offered here so that we can really begin to work toward helping oppressed people again i intend to reject the idea that america should have no voice at all in the future of south african blacks i think that the question that will be raised if we pass the dellums bill is whether america has not washed its hands like pontius pilate of the

polling company will be releasing within the next few days a sample poll of the american people on the issue of aiding the contras and of the war in nicaragua and i think the findings are going to be startling in terms of where we have come on this issue over the past 6 years they are going to show that the american people oppose giving 100 million in additional aid to the contras by a 7422 percent percentile that is up from late november at which time the percentages were at 62 to 33 percent they also are going to show that there is concern that american soldiers will end up in combat in central america fiftyeight percent are now concerned that is up from 47 percent in late november third they are going to show that over 70 percent oppose an invasion of nicaragua that is up from previous figures what this tells me and what this i think tells members of this body is that the weeks of hearings we have had on this issue the irancontra hearings in this capital have scared the

like to add my voice to those who have stood before the house and the committee this afternoon and pointed out that this provision by the banking committee is not a bailout of the banks if it was i would not support it instead the banking committee deserves congratulations for coming forward in an area in which there is presently no movement and encouraging some real movement that will augur to the benefit of this country more than any other it is a creative initiative it is one that has been in an area of great danger to our country and it is an area which presently is at a standstill also i think it is important to say that this is a free market solution it is a good creative free market solution to a serious problem i urge the members not to go backward not to put our heads in the

number of topics which have largely been dealt with in the house before the arizonaflorida land exchange issue the mississippi national river recreation area the san pedro riparian area have been dealt with in both the 99th and the 100th congresses by the house and other provisions of the bill that are really housekeeping in nature provide small land exchanges and the opportu alty to move forward with a number of projects in arizona the issue outstanding of course or the two issues outstanding are the hopin ajo issue which this rule of course makes in order an amendment by the gentleman from illinois so that issue will be debated before the body today and we can have an upanddown vote on that the rule also a selfexecuting rule deals with another problem in the bill and that really is the title viii issue that my colleague the gentleman from minnesota a diligent member of the house administration committee has pointed out the capitol historic commission that has been inserted in the bill on the senate side yesterday during the committee on rules i misspoke when i said all these issues had had hearings this issue obviously represents a special concern to him because of his responsibility on that committee but nevertheless i think that we can look beyond the sort of internecine warfare that goes on in the management of our building and grounds here at the capitol through the committee on house administration which we are all grateful for the role they play i think we would look to see that the appropriations language added by this rule is appropriate i guess the argument is that it still does not go far enough the fact is that we have special responsibilities and joint committees that function in this body with regard to libraries with regard to a host of operations that are run through them whether it is the general accounting office whether it is their libraries whether it is a variety of other things and clearly in this instance i think as we look at this historic structure i think all of us have been dismayed at the fact that there has not been an overall view that it really does not have a continuity from leadership to leadership in terms of the preservation of this structure i think the people that built this building and designed the grounds really had in mind a rather good idea a grand concept in terms of this building as a symbol and fully intended that we maintain it i do not think the facade should have to fall off the front of the building before we respond and that of course has literally been the case in terms of congress in the past i think that there is merit to creating this type of commission and involving in a coordinated way and in a professional way people who have historic cultural and architectural expertise i know my colleagues on the various committees and in this con gress have a great deal of expertiae but i just think that maybe having some professional advice in a formalized process so we do not have to depend upon the personalities of one of the leadership or persons in special positions mr spealer i think this title viii provision has significant merit i think it is generally a good idea and i am sure that we would benefit greatly from more close scrutiny of how it has been written however i think that it is possible to cure any defects i think the good greatly outweighs the concerns in terms of the legislation provisions i do not think anyone would disagree with the intention i cannot argue that the process has been perfect we are at the end of the session and surely committee members from the committee on ways and means and the committee on appropriations have to understand when they bring matters back to the house that they need rules that are not necessarily within the normal ambit of the legislative process i would strongly urge the members to vote up this rule it is a fair rule it deals with a host of problems i understand the concern of my colleagues but i think we ought to vote this bill up it is a very good bill i think it will really go a long way to addressing some of the concerns and policies that this body has expressed a great inter est in and surely we ought to be interested in the historic preservation of the capitol building and grounds r3 1115 the white house spent a good amount of money preserving the white house in the last years ronald reagan has done a good job in terms of historic preservation and protection of the white house i credit him for that and we ought to have pride at the legislative branch in government to do the same thing for the peoples house the capitol i hope our commission and that this intent will carry through that policy"]]}
