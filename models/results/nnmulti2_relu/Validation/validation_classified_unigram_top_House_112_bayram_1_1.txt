gallon this gas price hike is a result of instability in the middle east and possible oil speculation and is a reminder of our dangerous dependence on foreign oil sadly our republican colleagues are not advancing legislation to help our hardpressed consumers their plan would line the pockets of big oil which saw its profits skyrocket 30 percent in line with rising gas prices fortunately there are positive steps we can take to promote energy independence in america and to protect consumers improve vehicle efficiency boost production of domestic renewable energy and convert oil industry tax breaks into gas price relief for our consumers america owns 1 5 percent of the worlds oil but consumes 22 5 percent so we cant drill our way to energy independence the only way to end our dependence on foreign oil and reduce gas prices is by improving automobile efficiency and developing new sources of clean domestic energy energy independence is going to depend on reducing our oil consumption and shifting to domestic forms of energy like wind solar biofuels and gas energy independence will save consumers money and protect us from the instability of the middle east at the end of 2010 congress extended tax credits for biofuels and the production of wind and solar energy these tax credits increased wind energy production by nearly 43 percent in just 2 years so extending them is an important step to increasing the supply of domestic energy under the authority of the clean air act president obama and automakers recently announced an agreement to improve the efficiency of automobiles by 30 percent by 2016 this agreement will save consumers 3 000 for each car purchased 5 years from now here is another way of looking at it if you could save 30 percent at the pump better vehicle efficiency would more than offset the recent spike in gas prices unfortunately oil companies and their allies here in congress are trying to roll back much of this progress republican speaker boehner forced through legislation which would repeal much of the clean air act hurting american consumers and undermining our national security last week the leadership in the house passed legislation to shortcircuit safety rules for oil production off americas coasts increasing the likelihood of another deepwater horizon catastrophe their legislation would also allow oil exploration that would impede naval operations off the chesapeake bay in virginia this week they want to attempt to pass a bill allowing for more oil drilling even if it interferes with military bases or endangers coastal economies i do not support reckless efforts to allow unregulated oil drilling which endangers coastal economies and national security last week i introduced amendments to these oil drilling bills one would strike the antisafety language and add a provision to repeal 37 billion in oil company tax loopholes the amendment would remit this money to american drivers averaged among licensed drivers my amendment would give 185 to every licensed driver in america reducing the equivalent price of gasoline by 27 cents a gallon the other amendment was written to protect national security it simply requires that the commander in chief in consultation with the secretary of defense certify that before we drill for oil off the coast of virginia that it does not hamper national security and naval operations i was shocked that all but a handful of republicans voted to kill this commonsense amendment since the leadership has blocked efforts to include real gas price relief in their oil drilling bills i am introducing standalone legislation to assist consumers the bill entitled the gas price relief act would terminate tax loopholes for oil companies while rebating the savings to our hardpressed commuters throughout america there are many positive steps we can take to reduce our de pendence on foreign oil steps that will include clean energy renewable energy and

to take over a trillion dollars in cuts and this supercommittee will serve as a mock congress leaving 523 members of congress sitting on the sidelines while a group of 12 decides the shape of the country for a decade to come paying our debt should be a no brainer indeed the debt ceiling itself is an antiquated solution to a problem we no longer face and should be eliminated it was originally created to pay for world war i to provide our country with economic stability while at war today we are again in the midst of war but instead of protecting the stability of our economy some in

this morning my colleague on the rules committee mr dreier went on national public radio saying his party has not threatened to torpedo the economy by defaulting this statement defies reality weve been brought to this point precisely because the leadership in his party has walked out of negotiations and demanded that they get ideologically driven cuts before they will vote to protect the

our fellow citizens last month over 25 million americans failed to find fulltime work many have been out of work for so long that their unemployment benefits have expired as their skills erode and they are living on savings or charity from loved ones and friends in response we have not introduced a single bill in this house designed to invest significant government resources into creating jobs

families especially hard during these difficult times we really do need to protect programs that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable we need to increase funding for programs like snap and wic which

suffering at the gas pump with the national average price for gasoline up at around 3 75 per gallon representing an increase of about 40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves locked up in oil shale now 1 2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil that is comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 petroleumproducing countries of the world combinedjust in one segment of three rocky mountain states yet we are not producing it commercially in part to a very significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on federally owned public land we need to change that we need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and gas production generally we need to improve the permitting process for offshore development in the gulf of mexico and in other areas we need to allow the

right now that he would qualify as a new energy source thats how violative of freemarket principles this continued subsidy of this company is knowing that there are other companies that can provide the same resource without the government subsidies even after the department of energys recent announcement of another gift of free uranium to usec standard poors downgraded it to junkbond status who invests in something that has already achieved junkbond status with the exception of the united states congress thats what were voting on here today funding of a company that is now in junkbond status and jpmorgan the companys creditor now directly controls every penny usec spends because it felt the company could not manage its own precarious finances when i asked the treasury department whether government support for the company put taxpayers at risk it said yes and that extreme care should be taken before offering any exposure to the taxpayer but are we following the treasury departments advice no the department of energy has approved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of subsidies for this company and is about to approve another 82 million bailout in the coming days and congress has acceded to pressure to insert even more money in no fewer than three pieces of legislation that are currently pending including the 100 million contained in this bill weve been told this bailout is only about getting the tritium we need for our nuclear weapons but this is just not true the treaty that governs uranium enrichment technology does not prevent other companies from doing this work

their own expense and thats the point that were at not only will representative mccollum be acting against the wishes of 86 percent of the people that live and reside in the st croix river valley the responsibility for the increased costs of building this bridge rests squarely on the shoulders of representative mccollum and on her compatriots who have fought for decades to kill the building of this bridge the cost the bridge would have cost 80 million to complete back in 1992 if her compatriots wouldnt have tied this bridge project up for decades in the federal courts in nuisance lawsuits and why because they said there was pollution that was involved and what was this pollution that they asserted they said it would be visual pollution visual pollution because a federal bureaucrat came out to this river and pointed to the river and said that they didnt think that a bridge would look good built on this river and thats in spite of the fact that theres already a bridge thats here on

suggesting that we should be building a two or a threelane bridge why would you build a bridge that would be obsolete the day that its opened you would build a commonsense fourlane bridge to connect two fourlane highways this is also a center for industry in this region we have not only the prison the state prison we have also one of the largest window manufacturers in the world we have the sewer

i remember because i was very involved in trying to mitigate the balkan troubles i visited there many times visited with milosevic the dictator in belgrade actually i was in vukovar right before it fell so frankly the statement that was made earlier i think did a disservice to those of us who were not supportive of the kosova operation there was no plan to war protect the kosovar albanians we used air power milosevic invaded with ground trops if members will remember that countrys population was literally literally pushed out into macedonia and elsewhereabout 1 6 million refugeesbecause there was no plan when milosevic sent in the ground troops and killed thousands of people because we had no plan to protect them an estimated 10 000 people were killed so the revisionism that somehow

we just want to use them up and all that kind of stuff let me read for the record what the report says as mentioned in the introduction of this report the committee lauds the department of the

funds for the use of secretarial order 3310 which was to designate and as the gentleman said he couldnt designate wild lands because that policy didnt exist and he cant and hes in compliance with that it continues while the department is now rightly requesting the input of members of congress senators and the public the committee is concerned about the internal direction given by the bureau of land management regarding the inventory of lands managed by the bureau as the department has stated inventories of bureau lands are required under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma and the committee agrees the committee agrees with this reading of the act the committee points out that inventories should however cover all land uses multiple use not just lands with wilderness character the values to be assessed include wildlife fish habitat nonmotorized and motorized recreation hunting fishing grazing conventional and renewable energy development mining wilderness character forest management and aesthetics all of these values are important and one value does not supersede the other the committee also directs the bureau to use the definition of wilderness as defined in the 1964 wilderness act as directed by section 603 of flpma the committee will continue its oversight of this issue the secretary has done the right thing by withdrawing his policy of wild lands designation a designation that he made up only congress can designate a new land designation thats what congress does the secretary agreed with that withdrew it we have no problem and encourage them to go on with the inventories for all of the characteristics of public lands so the gentlemans comments relative to oh all we care about is mining and flattening the land or whatever he said is

to a recent media report china is expected to surpass the united states for the first time this year as the worlds leading patent publisher the more time we waste on frivolous litigation the less time we have for innovation another problem with the patent system is the lack of resources available to the pto the average wait time for a patent approval is 3 years or more these are products and innovations that will create jobs and save lives inadequately funding the pto harms inventors and small businesses the bill allows the director to adjust the fee schedule with appropriate congressional oversight and prevents congress from spending agency funds on unrelated programs this will enable the pto to become more efficient and productive reducing the wait time for patent approval patent quality will improve on the front end which will reduce litigation on the back end the patent system envisioned by our founders focused on granting a patent to the first inventor who registered their invention this is similar to the firstinventorto file provision in h r 1249 this improvement makes our system similar to the international standard that other countries use only it is better we retain both a 1year grace period that protects universities and small inventors before they file as well as the create act which ensures collaborative research does not constitute prior art that defeats patentability there are some who think this bill hurts small businesses and independent inventors but they are wrong it ensures that independent inventors are able to compete with larger companies both here and abroad american inventors seeking protection here in the united states will have taken the first step toward protecting their patent rights around the world the bill also makes the small business ombudsman at the pto permanent that means that small businesses will always have a champion at the pto looking out for their interests and helping them as they secure patents for their inventions this bill protects small businesses and independent inventors by reducing fees for both this bill represents a fair compromise and creates a better patent system than exists today for

those days the misery index was explained as the sum of unemployment and inflation rates but that sum actually was due to gas price sticker shock when gas prices rise above 4 a gallon that very fact triggers major unemployment here at home how many times does our american economy have to be hit over the head with a baseball bat before we recognize our conundrum we should be working full steam ahead to become energy independent here at home rather than coveting our neighbors goods if we look at the continuing use of petroleum inside our economyother than the recession were now in where weve had a little bit of a dip in imports due to decreased demandall the way going back to the 1970s every year weve consumed more imported petroleum the red lines show how much more is imported each year rather why dont we invest those trillions and trillions of dollars we are spending in the middle east and around the world to import that oil right here in our own country we literally could rebuild energy production capacity and much more from one end of our country to the other and create millions of jobs doing it americas chief strategic vulnerability is our dependence on imported energy how many more americans have to die to keep those oil lanes open it is no coincidence we have sent our soldiers to fight where the greatest global oil deposits are located my oath is to protect our nation against all enemies foreign and domestic americas petrol dependence is an enemy on both fronts foreign and domestic it is no secret that there are some big business interests including many global oil companies oil speculators and financiers trading in those petrodollars that are making a killing in many ways off of americas dependency in 2008 rising oil prices tripwired the great recession we are currently enduring and we know recent price hikes threaten our recovery just as our nation and our people are struggling to get back on their feet look at the profits that the major oil companies are ringing in from gas prices at over 4 a gallon just in the last quarter exxon raked in 10 7 billion bp brought in 7 2 billion chevron earned over 6 billion and the list goes on and onin one quarter one quarter these huge profits at the expense of our people and nation the american people suffer great hardship every time this petroleum addiction rears its ugly head and it has done so every decade consistently the situation keeps getting worse if anyone is paying attention in effect our american republic becomes a gasoline hostage and a sticker cash cow anytime the global oil markets need an infusion of oil cash or raise prices due to supply aberrations we simply cant leave america and our people this vulnerable and we cant keep killing our soldiers to keep those oil lanes open the biggest force in the world is inertia people dont want to change or dont know how to change our predicament or dont want to change this losing strategy for our nation its no secret that some interests are making a whole lot of money off the present equation i win you lose if these economic interests arent tamed and arent enemies of our republic i dont know what is bill greider wrote a book its time to come home america lets do that by restoring energy independence here at home and indeed our very liberty"], [0.03524982929229736, 0.46475017070770264, 1, "i thank my colleague from hawaii one of the other small states i know youre a delegation of two were a delegation of one i represent the whole state of delaware i tell my constituents that we have two senators and one member of congress that means that i have to work twice as hard to serve the people in my state im pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle this afternoon for our discussion about small business and job creation and id like to talk for a little bit about the situation in my state the state of delaware all of us are coming off a district work week where we spent our time im sure meeting with constituents talking to business owners small business owners large business owners and working our districts and i did the same thing in delaware not too far from the capitol here i would like to highlight two meetings that i had in particular one was a job fair that we held in georgetown delaware which is the county seat in the lower part of our state many people from the washington d c area know georgetown as they pass through it to go to our lovely beaches during the summer time to enjoy time with their family at the beach this particular day we sponsored a job fair in georgetown along with senator carper and senator coons this was a program that senator coons championed in wilmington initially and weve moved it now to the other two counties of our state and had a job fair in dover and a job fair in georgetown this past week really helping to connect those folks in our state who are unemployed or underemployed people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire and even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit over 8 percent unemployment in our state of delaware there are still a lot of jobs that go wanting mostly because the employers are not able to find people that have the required skills for that particular enterprise so the good news about this job fair is that we had 55 employers there many of whom were prepared to hire people and offer them jobs certainly take resumes and interview people or set up interviews but we had over 8 000 people who came seeking employment or seeking an upgrade in their current job situation and thats a lot of people in the small state of delaware in the least populous area of our state so it tells us the very serious problem that we have with the lack of jobs and the lack of skills that people might have to do the jobs that are out there later on in the week i met at pats aircraft which is an airplane manufacturing facility at georgetown airport theyve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years in fact when i was lieutenant governor one of the biggest problems that they had was finding workers that had the requisite skills to do the jobs that they had now they have since lost some of that work but they were looking ahead and anticipating with some assistance from the faa to extend the runway there at georgetown airportgoing back to your point about the need for infrastructure to stir business development business growth and job creation if we were able to extend the runway there at the airport pats would be able to hire more mechanics but there are a lot of people out there while they might want those jobs would not have the skills to do the work and so delaware technical and community college with the help of the state government has developed a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other airplane manufacturing facilities in our region we have a dassault falcon plant which does airplane maintenance and mechanics at the new castle county airport as well as a large boeing facility over the line in southeastern pennsylvania so these are jobs they are highly skilled jobs they are jobs that require mechanical ability they are jobs that require training and there are certainly lots of folks out there that are looking for employment and these are the kinds of jobs that we need to prepare people for one of the press conferences we had this week was at delaware technical community college where we highlighted a federal grant that was going to delaware tech to create training programs for businesses basically to enable people to upgrade their skills to take the jobs that are available one of the problems obviously that we have in our countryand the presidents employment council has identified this problemis that we have jobs that are out there but we dont have people with the right kinds of skills for those jobs so we need to have programsand this is where the public sector comes into play particularly technical and community collegesto provide that training and those skills for those folks later on in the week i met and spoke with the georgetown chamber of commerce and the georgetown chamber of course is comprised mostly of very small businesses they had a really simple message for me as a member of congress and that is that they see their businesses struggling because of a lack of confidence among consumers and when you think about the unitedstates economy at large about 70 percent of economic activity is consumer driven so when consumers dont have confidence either in their employment situation in the presentthey may not be employedor their future employment situation theyre not willing to spend money on small business services or products in the community and therefore these small businesses suffer so their message to me was really a simple one twofold one is do no harm in washington dc do the work of the people solve the problems that we have and inspire confidence and i think one of the ways that we can do thattheres a lot of discussion most of the discussion that i hear from my constituents in the state of delawareand weve had town hall meetings were going to have a telephone town hall meeting tonight im sure i will hear the same thing enough with the partisan bickering back and forth across the aisle lets focus on the challenges that we facecreating jobs and strengthening businesses creating a business climate in the short term where businesses can thrive where consumers can have confidence so theyll be willing to spend on small businesses and other procurement and in the long term address our deficits our debt and our budget imbalances if were able to do that well at least provide some confidence to the people that we represent that those that they send from delaware the members of the house of representatives here and our senators across the capitol are doing their part are working together are focused on not the politics of where we all stand in relation to the next election but on solving the problems that face our country i think the vote that we have coming at the end of this year which will be the result of the work of the committee on the budget will be maybe one of the most important votes in a number of years i have heard our majority whip steny hoyer refer to it as the most important vote here in the last 30 years and i think thats right in many respects because people out there my constituents your constituents ms hanabusa in hawaiii see our colleague from rhode island has joined us as wellour constituents are asking us begging us to do our work to inspire confidence and to do the right thing for the country and that involves giving people the skills they need to be able to do the jobs that are available out there creating confidence so businesses can make investments so people will be willing to spend money and consume so our economy will get back on its feet again in the long term well set up a fiscal situation with our government so that the economy can be strong and create jobs for my children and their children so i want to thank my colleague from hawaii for leading our dialogue this afternoon on job creation on small business development across our country in our respective districts and i look forward to sitting here with you for a few more minutes and engaging in this dialogue i just wanted to give a few words about how the people in delaware are responding to the work that we are doing or are not doing here in the congress"], [0.043534547090530396, 0.4564654529094696, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 2764 the wmd intelligence and information sharing act of 2011 this bill would strengthen information sharing at all levels of government with regard to chemical biological radiological and nuclear terrorist threats in the decade since the attacks on september 11 2001

nondefense environmental cleanup program one of the most important roles of government is to protect public health and safety however the amount of money appropriated in this bill is insufficient to do one of these most important areas our amendment ensures that nuclear cleanup sites get the funding they need to protect surrounding communities from radioactive contamination in my community and that of mr reeds in western new york the west valley nuclear waste reprocessing plant was established in the 1960s in response to a federal call to commercialize the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from power reactors just a few years ago the site ceased operation and more than 600 000 gallons of highlevel radioactive waste was left behind posing a significant and enduring hazard this site prone to erosion contains streams that drain into lake erie located just 30 miles away we have already seen a leak on the site develop into a plume of radioactive groundwater if this radioactive waste makes its way into the great lakes the largest source of surface fresh water in the world the environmental and economic implications would be devastating without question this hazardous and radioactive waste and the contamination that remains is one of our nations largest environmental liabilities in these cleanup efforts time is money failing to adequately fund the nondefense environmental cleanup program decelerates cleanup efforts for the past four decades progress in cleaning up west valley has been delayed by legal disputes and funding shortfalls for west valley this means 30 million in added maintenance costs per year in the current budgetary climate it is more important than ever that the federal government use taxpayers money most efficiently we cannot jeopardize the irreplaceable natural resources of the great lakes or the communities and resources near other nuclear sites across this nation by continuing to underfund this cleanup program im proud to work with my friend and colleague mr reed on this important issue and i urge support on this bipartisan amendment to ensure we finish the job"]]}
