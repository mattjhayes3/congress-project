in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a

disaster for constituents in my home district on long island and districts nationwide forcing working families to make up for many of the cuts in the form of higher state and local taxes the american people deserve honesty and this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754 billion over the period from 20092015 fails to account for the continuing presence of our troops in iraqthe administration knows we are going to approve an iraq supplemental upward of 80 billion for the first part of this year aloneand an estimated 384 billion over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the president does not hesitate to slash funding for the long island sound study office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our veterans our values as a society are not reflected in this budget we must ban together in congress to force an honest accounting and insist upon the restoration of longterm fiscal responsibility to our nation its not enough

rate increases or harmful cuts to security health care education veterans benefits and other programs that improve the quality of life for rhode islands working families while the republicans claim

wrong direction and next years deficit will likely be the largest in history with at least 400 billion added to the national credit card how does this blueprint make us safer while the department of homeland security receives an overall increase in funding the budget largely follows the presidents request which cuts needed resources for the first responders who risk their lives every day to protect us the spratt substitute contains 1 1 billion more than the republican budget for vital law enforcement programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without medicaid these people would likely join the increasing ranks of the uninsured lacking proper preventative care these patients will be forced to go to emergency rooms leading to long waits and higher costs for everyone these cuts will also threaten programs such as rite share an employer buyin program funded in part by medicaid the republican medicaid cuts are restored in the spratt substitute how does this blueprint prepare children

school counselors in contrast the spratt substitute provides 4 5 billion in additional funding for no child left behind and other valuable programs such as student loans and school lunches giving students the resources to succeed how does this blueprint honor those who serve our country in uniform perhaps most egregiously during this time of war the republicans want to cut veterans health care by 14 billion over five years impose new fees and increase copayments for veterans health care adding an undue burden to those who have served their country so bravely the spratt substitute provides

iraq so it would not degrade into anarchy as it has done and as a result of that the president in the way they do this with the military effectively fired him he is the only person who the bush

fraud and abuse in military contracting that was going on in world war ii even when our whole nation was in jeopardy in an existentialistic sense was in jeopardy but he still said we need to be careful with these dollars we have had umpteen billions of dollars disappear into the sands of iraq with nothing to show for it no meaningful reconstruction but tens of billions of dollars gone we have seen multiple gao reports inspector general reports we have seen multiple contractors many of whom have been very closely aligned with this administration there is no secret about that what we

decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers bipartisan bill this bill

ours obviously desperately want to vote differently they hold the board open for as long as humanly possible so that they can twist arms and get those colleagues of ours to change their votes and vote differently than obviously their conscience has told them that they should vote we are facingdown now a need to increase the debt limit the treasury secretary has indicated that we are going to bump up against our debt limit any day now really within the next month and we still have not voted to do that one of the interesting things that i have found politically over the years is that the republicans often accuse democrats of being taxandspend liberals all i ever hear is taxandspend liberal almost like equating it with curse words what has been clear is that the republicans since they have been in charge of this government and in total control of this government they have been borrowandspenders we have reached the poift h america now where this administration this president has spent more than the previous president certainly and other presidents combined we have spent more money now than the previous administration yet republicans continue to accuse democrats of being taxandspend liberals it is really just funny it has reached the point of sardonic humor let us look at the issue of the debt limit you see here that we have increased the debt limit not just on one not just ontwo but on five occasions we had had 3 trillion of increases of the debt limit in billions of dollars you have in june of 2002 450 billion increase in the debt limit in may of 2003 984 billion increase in the debt limit november of 2004 800 billion increase in the debt limit the pending increase now is another 781 billion for a total of over 3 trillion in increasing of the debt limit that means that our future generations my children their children are going to owe incredible sums of money have debt to foreign nations and that is not even talking about the deficit so many people really have trouble getting their arms around the difference between the debt and the deficit we have a problem with the deficit in this country and we have examples of that in chart form as well the deficit in this country has now reached 8 trillion 8 trillion next week when we come back and do the 30something hour we are going to have a chart that will try to illustrate for people just what that means what a billion dollars will do because it is really staggering when you think about it people have trouble getting their mind around that concept 8 trillion translated to every person in this country means that every person in this country owes 27 000 and when i am talking about a person i am talking about infants as well babies as well let us look at the budget deficits of prior presidents if you start with president reagan in 1982 he had a def icit of 128 billion we had a deficit of 128 billion you go all of the way down to this president and we are at 323 billion now that is just for fiscal year 2006 and that is obviously increased except for one year where it was a little bit higher in 2004 it was a little bit higher 412 billion so i feel heartened that we had somewhat of a drop but it is on the increase again we have got to make sure that we get back to the point that we were at during the clinton administration when we did not know from the term deficit because we had a surpkus what we were debating during the clinton administration was what we were going to do with that surplus were we going to use it to shore up the difficulties we were having with social security were we going to use it to shore up the difficulties that we were having with medicare we cpn9t have those di cussions any more because we are operating at our biggest deficit inhistory what we have proposed and what republicans have consistently rejected is going back to the paygo rules the payasyougo rule which means you do not spend it if you do not have it the republicans have repeatedly and unanimously rejected going back to the paygo rules these are two examples of amendments that were offered by mr spratt from south carolina in the 2006 budget resolution

supporting it 224 republicans opposing payasyougo now who is fiscally responsible and who is not i really ask you to think about that we have got to make sure that we return to payasyougo because even though it is difficult that is a hard policy to adopt making sure you have the money before you spend it anyone who lives if you think about it in terms of your household budget it is hard to only spend the money you have but we all know that you are obviously in the best fiscal shape you have the most fiscally sound budget in your home when you are only spending what you take in there are a lot of americans that do not do that there are a lot of americans that have credit card debt there are a lot of americans in this country who struggle every day to make sure that they can pay their bills and quite honestly the only way that they are often able to cover the needs that they have is by deficit spending in their own household but they know that it is not the right thing to do and ideally if they could afford it most of these families would not engage in that practice the problem is that they are not in very good shape fiscally in their own household so they have to the federal government does not have to you definitely cannot argue that we do not have the money to adopt this practice we do we have the money we just do not have the wherewithal unfortunately the republican leadership here has not had the nerve i guess for lack of a better term it has not had the nerve to adopt that responsible policy i really do not understand it i come from a state legislative background 12 years in the florida legislature anyone who comes from a legislative background and was an elected official in their home state in this body understands that every state in the country has to operate in the black according to their constitution you cannot deficit spend in a state budget you cannot do it you have only thle ability to spend the money that you have the federal government has i guess it is a luxury but it is a luxury that comes back to bite you very soon as you progress down the road and you end up throwing your own future into tremendous debt there is a usa today editorial that was just from the other day and it talks about who is really the party of small government and big spending and who is not it was really interesting usa today said tax cuts they say forced hard decisions and restrained reckless spending the last time we looked though republicans controlled both congress and the white house they are the spenders in fact since they took control in 2001 they meaning the republicans have increased spending by an average of nearly 7v2 percent a year more than double the rate in the last 5 years of the clinton era budget that is really telling so who is fiscally responsible who is for smaller government who is for responsible fiscal policy clearly given this chart where it indicates in usa todays opinion our thirdparty validator and this chart right here which shows the increase drastic increase of the deficit over time from the reagan administration to now let us look at the blue area right here see the blue years the blue years are surplus surplus when we did not have a deficit when we had paygo when we only spent the money that we had we had some members in our caucus that lost their elections because of that vote that lost their elections ensuring that we would adopt responsible fiscal policy that is because we stand on principle we do not blindly support our president we do not walk in lock step we vote our conscience and i wish that i had not seen the angst in so many of my republican colleagues faces when they had their arms wrenched behind their backs and were essentially forced to vote differently than you know in their heart they believed it is really sad i feel so free to come on this floor and you know leader pelosi she tells you you do what you feel is right i know we are not always going to agree you have to be able to do what you think is best for your district now of course she would like us to be unified and because we have such strong beliefs and values in our caucus we have the most unified caucus that we have had in history really since the 1950s the most unified caucus the democratic caucus in this chamber knows that we can take this country in a new direction that together america can do better and that if we work together and work through our differences and build consensus instead of forcing our colleagues to do what they do not necessarily believe in then we are going to make sure that we can come up with sound policy the clinton years we had surplus the other chart that you just had up is also telling again we do not force people in the democratic caucus to do what they do not believe i cannot imagine that my republican colleagues in every single district in this country stood in front of their constituents during their campaigns and said you know what i believe in deficit spending i believe in an 8 trillion deficit i just doubt that if i were in their districts at a town hall meeting that they would be telling their constituents they were glad that we had an 8 trillion deficit but yet they come up here and they vote to continue to support policies like that i do not get it other than blind loyalty i do not get it blind loyalty is what is hurting our constituents here in the united states of america let us look at how just the interest payments on the national debt we are going back to talking about the debt the money that we owe to other countries now just look at what the interest payments would pay for if we did not have to spend them on covering the national debt if we did not have to spend them we could spend them on education we could spend them on homeland security we could spend them on improving the quality of life for our nations veterans you have about 50 billion that we could spend on helping our nations veterans you have abqut i think that is about 30 billion that you could spend on shoring up homeland security we are talking about domestic discretionary funding the kind of funding that we can specifically direct to port security and airport security and making sure that our nations borders are not infiltrated by terrorists but we cannot spend that money on those things because we are paying interest on our debt to other countries you could spend almost 100 million i think it is about 75 billion dollars excuse me we get the bs and ms confused sometimes 75 billion on education now one of the biggest frustrations that i know i get in terms of feedback from my constituents is the no child left behind act and the fact that this president committed from day one and mr miller my good friend from california who was just here championed that legislation on our side with the administrations commitment that they were going to support full funding we have not had full funding on no child left behind we have not had the ability to really implement that legislation and ensure that our children in our public schools are prepared for the path that they choose in life what we have done instead is we have had to spend that money on things like interest on the national debt we have had to spend that money on tax cuts becapse itis tax cuts that have been the top priority of this administration still todaythis presidents and this administrations highest priority appears to be making the tax cuts for our wealthiest americans permanent in the face of the national debt being the size that it is in the face of us having an 8 trillion deficit where each american owes 27 000 apiece how is that possible there are times when you just have to say we cannot afford it it would be nice but we cannot afford it when does that happen here"], [0.0007458329200744629, 0.9992541670799255, 1, "i rise in opposition to the conference report on h r 3010 the fiscal year 2006 laborhhseducation appropriations report before the house today shortchanges americas children its families its workers and its most vulnerable citizens the laborhhseducation bill embodies our priorities and values as americans in it congress provides the yearly resources needed to keep our families healthy our children educated our workers employed and our most vulnerable citizens a productive part of our society this bill is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation congress addresses each year chairman regula understands this responsibility he understands that this is the peoples bill and he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he was given in a fair and conscientious way so my no vote today should in no way be seen as a lack of respect or appreciation for the efforts of ralph regula the chairman of the labor hhs appropriations subcommittee chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have worked within this tight budget allocation to address the needs and priorities of our states and communities as best they could under the circumstances for example the conference report includes increases in two critical areas to help infants and their families the first is the centers for disease control and preventions folic acid national education program this program has been instrumental in the prevention of birth defects by encouraging women of childbearing age to take the recommended amount of folic acid daily thereby decreasing the rate of neural tube defects the second increase is for the health resources and services administrations newborn screening program for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic metabolic hormonal and or functional conditions for which there are effective treatment or intervention in addition for the first time this bill also includes programmatic funding for the national media campaign to fight underage drinking which is being conducted by the ad council i thank the committee for helping our country make progress in these critical public health areas the presence of these and a small number of other positive programmatic funding levels however is simply not enough to warrant approving this conference report the constraints placed on this bill by the budget priorities and decisions of the republican leadership are not worthy of this house and the values of the american people i voted against the house bill when it came to the floor in june precisely because it fell soshort of meeting the needs of americas children families and the most vulnerable among us i had hoped that the bill would be improved in the conference it is unfortunate however that in this conference agreement the way they chose to improve overall programmatic funding from the original house bill levels was to take resources away from other priorities and community needs this report and its funding decisions do not stand in isolation they reflect the misguided priorities of a republican leadership that has continually put the interests of the wealthy and the privileged before the needs and priorities of working and middleclass americans this laborhhseducation conference report is a direct result of an economic agenda of tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and it weakens americas future by underfunding key education health and human services programs if approved this bill will impose cuts to essential programs important to americans in at least three major areas first this conference agreement significantly shortchanges our nations workers the bill cuts labor programs 430 million below the fy 2005 levels training and employment services for the 7 4 million americans who are unemployed are funded well below the fy05 levels this includes a 31 million cut to adult training grants a 36 million cut to youth training grants and a 141 million cut to unemployment insurance offices the unitedstates employment service office which matches job seekers with job openings is slashed by 10 5 percent and the report freezes funding for dislocated and older workers in addition the bill slices international labor affairs the program that helps eradicate abusive child labor practices and protect worker rights by 21 percent secondly this report is simply a reaffirmation of the administrations hollow commitment to education slashing the no child left behind funds by 784 million below the fy 2005 level it cuts the education technology block grant program that provides access to technology in schools by a shocking 45 percent from last years level it reduces the even start program supporting services for low literate and lowincome families by 56 percent and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at 4 billion below the republican promise to put special education on a fast track to full funding finally the report is particularly devastating to the health of americans some of its most significant cuts are directed towards the critical programs that provide a health care safety net for the uninsured the conference agreement provides 34 million less than the house passed bill and 89 million less than the senate bill for grants to health centers for services to the uninsured the maternal and child health block grant is cut by 3 percent reducing its true per capita purchasing power by almost 20 percent below the fy 002 level the conference agreement terminates the healthy communities access program that makes grants to local hospitals health centers and providers so that they can provide better integrated systems of care for the underinsured and uninsured lastly as if cutting services wasnt enough the conference agreement virtually decimates the title vii health professions training programs cutting overall funding from 300 million in fy 2005 to 94 million in fy 2006 these drastic reductions to critical programs are not necessary ranking member david obey has consistently laid out a commonsense approach to this problem by simply reducing the tax break for those with incomes greater than 1 million we could add funding for no child left behind programs maintain college affordability by increasing the money for pell grants shore up our health safety net programs and rebuild our public health system to respond to pandemics and possible terrorist attacks but these fiscally responsible efforts by mr obey and the democrats have been defeated by the republican majority at every tum the result is this grossly underfunded bill which we are considering today in the end this congress will be judged by how well we have served the needs of all our citizens and communities as a result this laborhhseducation bill will not reflect kindly on us we can and must do better for the future of our families our children

would be joining many of my colleagues in voting yes today but the bill we have before us is fatally flawed this rewrite is outdated unfair and unconstitutional i cannot support it in its current form this rewrite treats georgia as if nothing changed in the past 41 years in other words this rewrite seems based on the assumption that the voting rights act hasnt worked as a georgian who is proud of our tremendous progress and proud of our current record of equality i am here to report to my colleagues in the house that the voting rights act has worked in my state and now it is time to modernize the law to deal with the problems of today not yesteryear it is true when the voting rights act was first passed in 1965 georgia needed federal intervention to correct decades of discrimination now 41 years later georgias record on voter equality can stand up against any other state in the union today black georgians are registered to vote at higher percentages than white georgians and black georgians go to the polls in higher percentages than white georgians onethird of our statewide elected officials are african americans including our attorney general and the chief justice bf our

this ringing endorsement from my colleague from georgia congressman john lewis an icon of the civil rights movement under oath in federal court 5 years ago congressman lewis testified there has been a transformation its a different state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the

simply never be forgiven that georgians must eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of todays new voting problems the voting rights act represents a grand trophy of great accomplishment for congress but after 41 years the trophy

has failed according to the white house office of national drug policy coca cultivation in peru has increased to 94 000 acresthe highest level in eight years the international trade commission noted

it on the floor just the other evening about how she is going to enjoy her virginia residence perhaps much more peaceful less hassled but from time to time perhaps a little less interesting as well but certainly more restful and she deserves the rest because her service has been extraordinary as has been said by the gentleman from california she has worked in the house since the late 1960s she witnessed during that time some of the most important events that have occurred on the house floor including debates on legislation affecting every aspect of americans lives as she transcribed innumerable speeches and statements of hundreds of members of congress those who transcribe history are critically important because future generations will learn from the historic record that they have set down and the accuracy of that reporting is critically important not only to the deliberations of this body today but it will be critically important to the precedents of tomorrow mrs hanback has dedicated her career to serving the american people just as surely as every one of us who serves here in elected office those who serve as reporters and at the desk and as the parliamentarians and in every other aspect of making sure this house runs correctly serve america serve americas citizens serve americas freedom by accurately reporting for and helping oversee the production of helped ensure that there is a government accessible to the people and is therefore a government for the people of the people and by the people susan was critical as so many of you are whose names are not known to the public and indeed whose names may not be known to many who serve here by your sides every day but because your names are not known it does not mean that the service you perform is not absolutely essential to our democracy susan hanback was offered a job as a senate official reporter in 1987 as testimony to the love of this house she turned that offer down and chose to stay in the house because she thought it was more interesting and the people said amen we are all of course very grateful susan that you made that decision we have been advantaged not only by the skill with which you have performed your job but by the warmth of your personality and the grace that you have served this body i would like to wish you all the very best the gentlewoman from california"],

northwest airlines have recently filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 united airlines also recently got a bankruptcy court to severely discount the value of its employee pensions clearly the airline industry needs some help and they need some leadership but an article that i read yesterday forces me to question the leadership of certain executives in the airline industry gary wilson is the chairman of northwest airlines a role where he is supposed to be providing leadership to his company northwest airlines is currently subject to a work stoppage by mechanics and cleaners over wage concessions and job reductions and now northwest has approached their pilots and their flight attendants asking them to take significant wage cuts earlier this year northwest airlines stopped funding their defined pension benefit program only funding their employees 401 k program and i am sure that the 401 k was also jbuying plenty of northwest stock and what was chairman gary wilson doing during this time with his 4 3 million shares of company stock he was selling that stock today in the detroit free press there is an article and the title is northwest airline chief sold shares just before bankruptcy the article says less than a month before northwest airlines corporation filed for bankruptcy its chairman sold nearly a third of his remaining shares gary wilson was not showing faith or confidence in the company that he is charged with leading instead he was dumping his stock before his company went under and i wonder if the employee 401 k was selling or even if it was allowed to sell at the same time mr wilson sold his shares at an average of 5 45 per share and just yesterday that stock was trading for 84 cents per share northwest airlines is a major carrier in the detroit michigan market and it serves my district we have been hearing all summer long that northwest was in trouble and that it could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection well what took so long one has to wonder if the bankruptcy filing was delayed simply so executives like mr wilson could sell their stock to make sure they got their money before the company went out that is not leadership that is cowardice or worse the employees and the customers of northwest deserve better and while northwest has been asking employees to make concessions in their pensions they have not been asking the same of their executives in fact this past july it was reported that the supplemental pension plan that covers the companys ceo was not subject to a pension freeze that pension was slated to give the ceo nearly 1 million a year if he retired at the age of 65 that was reported again in the detroit free press on july 16 northwest airlines to freeze pensions for salaried staff not affected by the freeze is the supplemental pension plan that covers ceo doug steenland among others in its last annual report northwest indicated that steenland was on track to receive an annual pension of 947 417 a year if he retires at age 65 and the airline has said that such generous pensions are needed to recruit and retain top executives well based on those examples i do not think northwest has done a very good job of attracting the best executives we need strong airlines in this country we also need competition we need safety and quality customer service in the airline industry of course employees need to know if sacrifiqe is needed in the face of increasing costs and competitive pressures but so do executives they should be setting the tone for the company and they should lead by example they should not cut and run in the face of trouble what is happening at northwest airlines at its very highest levels is disgraceful"], [0.9686644673347473,

the name of progress believe it is not the embryo destruction its opponents oppose but rather progress itself but it is not st and the bill before us now the stem cell therapeutic and research act proves it this bill which provides for federal funding of research using adult stem cells which have unlike embryonic stem cells proven medical benefits in treating more than 60 separate diseases will

scientific exploration into the potential benefits of killing human beings proponents of medical research on destroyed human embryos would justify admittedly unfortunate means with the potential ends

that small business owners who make good faith efforts to comply with health and safety laws are dealt with fairly and equitably by the occupational safety and health administration nearly every employer recognizes that improving workplace safety is good for business and it is good for workers employers are subject to fierce competition both at home and abroad and must compete in the face of high taxes skyrocketing health costs escalating litigation and burdensome government regulations these osha reform bills are designed to improve worker safety and enhance the competitiveness of small businesses that are the real engine of job growth in our country the unitedstates economy continues to grow and more and more employers are continuing to hire workers each month last week the labor department reported that more than 3 7 million new jobs have been created since may of 2003 marking 25 consecutive months of sustained job creation but we need to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire new workers and compete in our economy that is why these bills are so important since republicans assumed leadership of congress 10 years ago we have undertaken considerable efforts to make bureaucracy more responsive and more accouintable to workers and taxpayers let me give just a few examples we stopped unwarranted and invasive osha regulations proposed by the clinton administration that would have held employers liable for the safety of their employees who work from home we stopped one of the most over reaching attempts at regulation in our nations history by repealing an irresponsible and unworkable ergonomics regulation that would have cost employers billions of dollars and killed millions of jobs we have dealt with the problem of costly unfunded mandates by ensuring that congress does not pass expensive legislation and then place it onto the backs of state and local governments this decade of progress on regulatory reform should give every american confidence that congress is making positive steps every year to improve government accountability and today we want to take one more step one more positive step to help improve workplace safety i think a goal we all share osha under the bush administration has made significant efforts to supplement traditional enforcement programs with cooperative partnerships between the agency and employers i am pleased to report these voluntary programs have proven successful in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses in fact if we look at this chart workplace injuries and fatalities have declined significantly during the bush administration and as this chart shows workplace injuries and illnesses have declined significantly under the bush administration to their lowest point in history to a rate of just five injuries or illnesses per 100 workers moreover workplace fatalities have made similar declines there has been a 5 8 percent reduction in workplace fatalities since the bush administration took office and that is significant progress why has such progress been miade because under this administration osha and employers have started to work together more cooperatively and more proactively to solve workplace safety problems before injuries and fatalities occur a gao report released last year said voluntary partnerships between osha and employers have considerably reduced the rates of injury and illness and have fostered better working relationships with osha improved productivity and decreased workers compensation costs we strongly support osha targeting the bad actors that defy the law and compromise the safety of their workers but we also need to recognize that most employers are good actors who work hard to address job safety concerns no employer wants to deal with unnecessary osharelated litigation and escalating attorneys fees that would result from that enforcement most employers want to comply with the law and the offer of assistance from osha is enough to provide the incentive they need to make this investment employers will use these resources because safety pays the reform measures we will consider today are proposals that while fairly modest in substance are important to small business owners who struggle every day to comply with the complex osha laws and provide a safe working environment for their workers while facing an increasingly competitive worldwide economy efhployers who make good faith efforts to comply with osha standards deserve to be treated fairly and have their day in court and these commonsense bills will help ensure that they receive that opportunity the first bill on tap today the occupational safety and health small business day in court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary 15day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason this bill essentially codifies administrative action taken by the labor department last year and ensures appropriate disputes are resolved based on

provides reforms that effectively balance the countrys need for strong national security protections with its need for continued foreign investment while our national security objectives must be paramount in this area i do have some concern about the time cfius could take under the bills provisions to review an acquisition that it ultimately determines presents no national security issues the bill allows for a cfius review period of up to 30 days followed by an investigation of up to 45 days when certain conditions specified in the bill are determined to be present the investigation period can then be extended under certain circumstances notably there is a mandatory investigation of all acquisitions by stateowned companies even in the absence of any showing of a possible national security concern i would prefer to see the process shortened where it is apparent at an early stage that national security is not an issue and i urge my colleagues to consider changes in this regard in conference it would be unfortunate if cfius resources were diverted from acquisitions with real national security implications to those with no such implications i am comforted on this point however by the fact that the review and investigation provisions would not preclude a person from petitioning cfius to dispense with the initial review period and to go directly to the investigative stage thereby shortening the process in situations that do not present significant security risks my understanding is that such a petition could be filed under the current cfius regime and i do not read the bill as changing the law in that regard i would assume that cfius would consider any such petition on a casebycase basis and would decide whether or not to grant it depending on various factors affecting national security such factors i assume would include whether the acquirer had established its national security credentials in previous cfius proceedings or otherwise whether in the case of a governmentowned acquirer the government was a unitedstates ally and many other factors bearing one way or another on national security i am also encouraged by the fact that the bills review and investigation provisions prescribe a maximum not a minimum number of days again i want to compliment the floor managers on a bill that puts national security first but that also will allow our

that has been going on here for the last 40 or 45 minutes or so what we have heard from the people who have complained about the patriot act is the potential for abuse rather than abuse itself i would

provisions of law which are not sunset including the national security letters because the facts simply are not there that there has been abuse what i would like to ask the members as we are debating the patriot act as it goes forward through conference and to the floor is to look at what the justice department has done and where the justice department has done it right the justice department should be told they have done it right and that means eliminating the sunsets from those areas where it has done it right and where there has to be a greater scrutiny on it such as the two provisions in the housepassed bill and the lone wolf provision that are being talked about we can talk about future sunsets and i support the concept of doing that but simply going around and painting with a broad brush the justice department for the potential of abuse which has not happened i think is unfair and does not go to the debate of whether the patriot act has actually served to protect the people of the united states without trampling on their civil liberties it has done that that is why it is a good law and that is why some provisions should be mgde permanent and some provisions should
