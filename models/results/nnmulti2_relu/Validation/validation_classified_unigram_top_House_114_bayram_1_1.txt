our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [1.3709068298339844e-06,

on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [4.887580871582031e-06, 0.9999951124191284, 1, "i want to thank my good friend the distinguished gentlewoman from illinois robin kelly for once again presiding over this important cbc special order hour as well as her coanchor the distinguished gentleman from new jersey who is right across the hudson river and who so ably serves the communities of newark and beyond this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the congressional black caucus most recently from the gentlewoman from texas with whom i serve on the judiciary committee about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the confederate battle flag but perhaps more importantly what is the legacy that we want to have as americans as members of congress in dealing with the complicated issue of race it is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the house floor to have this conversation this is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the american people an appropriate one i would add given the houses constitutional relationship to the people of america this of course being the only institution that was envisioned by the founding fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people the senates members of course in its original constitutional version were elected by the state legislature then of course the presidency to this day is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the electoral college so this is the peoples house the institution most intimately connected to the people of america and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power we witnessed that last week as we were forced unfortunately to discuss the issue of the confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all racesdemocrats and republicans blacks whites the extraordinary leadership from the governor of south carolina and the distinguished gentleman from south carolina jim clyburncame together at the moment when the confederate battle flag was coming down in south carolina there were members of this house trying to lift it up it was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in america led in south carolina to address the battle flag issue on this house floor but i am hopeful that as we move forward now in a more productive way we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in america that supporters of the confederate battle flag have fought against as others have detailed during the presentation here today the battle flag which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the civil war remained largely dormant in american history until 1954 in the supreme courts decision of brown vs board of education it was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that african americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the deep south and in other places in america really it was in the midfifties and then into the early sixties when the confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold jim crow it was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like congressman john lewis who in 1965 was the cochair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee it was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by john lewis and others to make sure that the franchisethe right to votewas colorblind in nature and that the 15th amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout america and in the deep south where there were those who were trying to prevent african americans from being able to vote the battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening it seems to me that rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor so it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the house floor last week and have to come to the house floor today to continue to address this issue hopefully reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of dayseven prior to the august recessand we can move beyond the confederate battle flag issue and address some important substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the confederacy we dont want to see the ghosts of the confederacy invading the united states congress from a policy perspective those nine soulsgodfearing churchgoing african americanswho were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired in part by the confederate battle flag one of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across america as has been mentioned we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the united states how can it be that we have 5 percent of the worlds population but 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in america it is an incredible act of legislative malpractice but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in america isnt it reasonable particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in charleston south carolina that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns consistent with the second amendment from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm it seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as americans it also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 voting rights act to stop trying to prevent americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in american democracy yet something happened in the aftermath of 2008 a real interesting moment in november of that year that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country as a result 2 years later when there was a midterm election subsequent to that there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties what shocks me is that even the supreme court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated and this house refuses to act on fixing the voting rights act i would argue thatagain consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming togetherthat perhaps that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down on the one hand the divisive symbol of hatredthe confederate battle flagfrom here in this capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across america so that we can lift up policies that make americans safer policies that are consistent with our values and that

payne who are tremendous advocates here in the congressand for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts"], [1.2254608918738086e-05, 1.2254608918738086e-05, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman as profoundly tragic as it is no one should have been surprised by the recent revelations that planned parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of what planned parenthood is doing to them i yield to the gentleman

candidates that are announced for president of the united states i am grateful for every one of them i have never seen such a field of candidates that step up and want to serve this country from the oval office the high quality of the character and the integrity that they have the varied experience and the success that they have demonstrated in their lives there have been a lot of easier times to win the republican nomination than there is now as i look at the candidates that are out thereand i have been tuning my ear encouraging themi have yet to hear any of the candidates deliver a compact inclusive approach to how to defeat islamic jihad i listen to them speak and i like the components that i hear from them one of them says we win they lose i like that but how are we going to do that we need a strategy one of them says if you attack us we will kill you okay well lets kill them first that is fine with me they have declared war on us isis for example has established a caliphate they declare it to be a caliphate it is a caliphate in northern syria and in north and western iraq that real estate that they control is a caliphate and they threaten all of the rest of the region and they threaten us they say that their black flag is going to fly over the white house well some would say that will be a cold day we have seen some dramatic changes in history over the last few years i would say to the united states we need to step up to this we need to recognize our enemy we need to defeat our enemies our enemies are islamic jihad and islamic jihad is comprised of the element within islam that believes that their path to salvation is in killing us and that they can bring out some kind of worldwide revolution where in the end it will just be the purest of the pure of islamists that are left on the planet they will have killed everybody else and all whoever is left must knuckle down to sharia law we need to defeat the ideology and when i say defeat the ideology and i am speaking to a group of people i will often see that look on their face such as why do you think you can defeat an ideology you cant defeat an ideology you cant change a culture you cant defeat ideology i recall one of those rebuttals that came to me and i said tell that to the japanese in fact in world war ii in a 31 2 year period of time this country with our allies very powerfully this country defeated three ideologies the ideology of japanese imperialism the ideology of italian fascism and the ideology of german nazism all three of those ideologies went down in flames in a 31 2 year period of time in the face ofi will say this mr speakerthe superior culture the western civilization a superior culture that has a robust free enterprise that has people that volunteer to engage in the economy into the military that reach out and pull each other up the ladder this robust united states of america coupled with our allies reaching across the map of western civilization rose up rose up and defeated three ideologies in a 31 2 year period of time in the second world war and then it took on a fourth ideology which was the russian version of communism that took about 45 years they were a little more tenacious it was not then just a kinetic operation it wasnt just going up in flames i am grateful that it wasnt instead it was the economic and then political collapse of the soviet union brought about this way ronald reagan saw this margaret thatcher saw it margaret thatcher went to ronald reagan and said with mikhail gorbachev i have found a man with whom we can do business i dont quite understand the motive of gorbachev and he seems to have a little bit of revisionist history that comes out of him from time to time but i also know that pope john paul ii traveled throughout areas of europe and went into poland and told them do not despair because they could be a free people the forces of the ideology of western civilization western christendom as churchill described it in his speech in fulton missouri are the forces that stood up against russian communism in about 1984 when jeane kirkpatrick stepped down as ambassador to the united nations under reagan she made a statement upon her departure which was this she said what is going on in this cold warand that was near the height of the cold warwhat is going on is monopoly and chess on the same board the united states and the soviet union are playing chess and monopoly on the same board it is just that the only question is will the united states of america bankrupt the soviet union economically before the soviet union checkmates the united states militarily that was the question it was succinctly put and i believe that will also show up on her wikipedia page but i happened to find it in the des moines register back in that year 1984 jeane kirkpatrick was right five years later the soviet union imploded on november 9 the wall went down in berlin and that was a symbol actually i will say literally the iron curtain came crashing down throughout berlin and the iron curtain all across europe went crashing down people flowed freely back and forth the free world had defeated the ideology of communism that was the soviet version of it for a time freedom echoed all the way across eastern europe all the way to the pacific ocean and it can be restored again that is the foundation that we have that we work with we are the people thatbecause of free enterprise because we have idea people with good educations and a solid moral foundation and a good work ethic this country has generated more patents than anybody else created more inventions than anyone else but cooperated with especially the western world and with the creativity that we have we have been able to rise up against ideology after ideology defeat three of them during world war ii and defeat soviet communism in a 45year period of the cold war now we are faced with another ideology that rises up to challenges islamic jihad if you go back to the time of mohammed about the last 20 years of his life and for 100 years after his death there was a conquest going on ofshall i call them religious conversions by the sword and as the conquest was going on islam was invading and occupying most of the known world at the time by 732 ad the islamists were outside the city of tours in france when charles martel brought his infantry into the trees to face the cavalry charge of the islamists and cavalries dont operate very well in the forest and that is how the charles martel charles the hammers infantry defeated them there and chased them out of tours and across the plains and left their bones scattered a long ways back towards spain that was 732 ad and you can fastforward again and again to catch some of the milestones in 1571 the battle of lepanto where an islamist navy was sunk by the holy league navy that went to meet them in the aegean sea you can go to 1683 when vienna was surrounded by islamists of the time on july 14 they surrounded vienna and for more than 2 monthsthey besieged vienna for roughly 2 months and then on september 11 the three german infantries under three german kings and jan sobieski the polish king brought his cavalry they held a service at kahlenberg church which was razed it was in ruins at the hands of the islamists but they held a service there in the evening of september 11 and prayed for gods deliverance of their battle the next day that it already enjoined on september 11 and the deliverance of vienna which happened as in the famous battle of vienna september 11 and 12 it goes on then september 11 became the date that lived in infamy for the people who attacked us on september 11 2001new york pentagon and pennsylvaniaand then again on september 11 2012 benghazi that date means something to them it ought to mean something to us they have been fighting western civilization for 1 400 years and they have been adapting themselves to the technology that is created in the western world creating very little themselves but borrowing our technology and some of that technology that is now being borrowed is the internet the internet that is being used to inspire and to recruit and to direct the islamists that are attacking americans and attacking people that are not in alignment with isis and with islamic jihad that is the effort that is coming and the ability that they have to use the internet to coordinate and communicate they will say as high as 100 000 tweets and emails and communications a day are coming out of isis and islamic jihad in the broader definition of it as high as 100 000 a day we need to bring about warfare against them and it means not just defensive warfare to protect ourselves but offensive warfare to attack them through the same medium that they are using to attack us so here is the list it is not just a kinetic war against them which they have declared against us the kinetic war we need to do cyber warfare financial warfare educational warfare against them we need to build a strong alliance with especially the moderate muslim countries in the middle east those who should be our allies but for being alets say given the short end of the stick from our state department during this administration and i am speaking of countries like egypt the united arab emirates for example jordan to a lesser degree but they are natural allies to the united states they are natural allies in fact they are allies to israel today they have been attacking our islamist enemies in that part of the world the egyptians allowed for planes to fly out of there to fly into yemen and the emirates sent some of their air force there you have seen the saudis do the same thing we can build an alliance in the middle east with saudi arabia whom i have got slightly less confidence in than i do in egypt and in the united arab emirates with jordan and also working in cooperation with israel when president elsisi of egypt says to me that his relationship with prime minister netanyahu is stronger with egypt and israel and president elsisi and prime minister netanyahu stronger than it is with the united states we should be troubled by that we should be troubled by a foreign policy that has alienated the egyptians that has caused the uae to wonder what is america doing why are we paving the road to damascus for our enemies why would we consider doing such a thing so this strategy a strategy that i have put into an oped in the national review which was just published here in the last couple of days lays out a strategy to conduct cyber warfare both offensive and defensive and economic warfare to shut off the funds that are flowing to islamic jihad wherever they might be flowing from wherever they might be flowing through whoever might be doing business with them and thinking they are going to profit we have got to turn that the other way and then we need to shut down and shut off if we canand this is the most difficult component of the taskthe educational system out there that is teaching this kind of hatred into the next generation build alliances with the moderate muslim countries as i have said encourage them we need to be arming the kurds with everything that we can get to the kurds everything the kurds can use and that doesnt mean send it through baghdad to get the baghdad stamp of approval it means directly to the kurds along with special operation forces that could be on the ground with the kurds and call in airstrikes and support the kurds as one jaw of the vice that will squeeze isis in iraq and in syria the other jaw of the vice is a natural it is already there it is assad and when those two jaws of the vice to come together and crush isis by that point we can take a look at assad and decide how to approach the power that may be left in syria at that point in time this is just a quick list of a strategy to defeat the ideology of islamic jihad the time has come for us to do that i want to see a presidential candidateor 16 of them i hopewho can articulate a vision to bring about the defeat of this enemy that has been bringing battle against western civilization for 1 400 years that targets the united states of america as the great satan and the center of their efforts they would like to destroy all of the united states of america and while this is going on we have got a treaty proposal from the president of the united states with iran in the spring or summer of 2008 as a candidate he said to iran mr ahmadinejad if you will unclench your fist we will extend our hand i would remind the public of that because that fist is still clenched in iran and the president is poised to hand over 150 billion to the iranian economy that will juice that economy up it will allow them to bring conventional weaponry to bear it will allow them to fund more hezbollah it will allow them to continue to develop the most recent version of centrifuges and even if they comply in 10 years the situation is set up where rather than one weapon it is 100 weapons icbms sticking out of the sand in the middle east there is much to be done for this western civilization we need to strengthen our culture we need to believe in who we are we need to sort the best things out of what we are and strengthen them we need to cull out the

colleague from virginia for organizing this today and for his leadership on child nutrition programs i want to thank all my colleagues for being here this is an important issue there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer months as well why are my friends making it so difficult

background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that they work every day 170 felons are stopped from buying a gun because of a background check and 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of background checks everyone says they want to keep guns away from dangerous people but the only way to know if someone is dangerous is to conduct a background check without background checks how do you know if a person buying a gun is a criminal or dangerously mentally ill if the man who killed catherines daughter

everything we are blessed with everything we cherishfrankly probably a lot of the things we take for granted for those of us in the pacific northwest we give thanks for the puget sound we give thanks for our salmon we give thanks for all the natural beauty that surrounds us and we give thanks that billy frank jr was in our lives as was indicated earlier in addition to the many other awards he received in his lifetime just last week the president conferred upon billy frank jr posthumously the presidential medal of freedom it is literally no exaggeration to suggest that what martin luther king meant to civil rights and nelson mandela meant to south africa billy frank jr meant to the entire pacific northwest indeed to indigenous people throughout the globe he is a fitting person for the prestigious honor that we hope to bestow on him today we have an opportunity to do something todayand i recommend we seize itto preserve his legacy in the place he called home billy frank jr was indeed the foremost advocate for restoration of native american fishing treaty rights in the pacific northwest he cherished clean water and healthy salmon runs he was a key voice in the recovery of the puget sound he also as has not been mentioned proudly served our nation in the united states marine corps he was an mp i believe during the korean war he got along with everyone he was open and inclusive his energy was literally infectious we were deeply stunned in may of 2014 that he passed away even though at the age of 83 we thought billy would live forever he is gone but his spirit is not and his story is not his courage and belief in us is here because you see billy wandered the halls of congress frequently and testified numerous times he respected this institution and he was a powerful voice within our chambers his story is in the nisqually national wildlife refuge in the 10th congressional district which i have the privilege to represent which we now protect to give our wildlife a clean and sustainable home billy grew up at a place called franks landing which is literally just a hop skip and a jump from the refuge he fished in the nisqually river in and next to the area where the refuge is now that is the location where he was arrested more than 50 times for advocating for his treaty fishing rights this bill will rename that refuge after billy frank jr also as has been indicated it calls for the establishment of a national memorial at the exact place of the signing of the medicine creek treaty in 1854 that was the first treaty in the state of washington between indian people and the newly established territorial government in this case it was between the people of the nisqually the puyallup squaxin island and the muckleshoots throughout his storied career people often asked billy how is it you do this get up every day and so effectively advocate on behalf of clean water and good fish runs how do you do that decade after decade he would always tell them the same thing tell your story so when people go to the billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge they will be able to see why he held fishins they will see why he risked arrest they will see why he ultimately worked with others to help protect his home like many young people today he fought for what he believed in but later worked with lawmakers to build consensus he started out as a civil rights protestor civilly disobedient and an advocate he ended up being one of the great uniters in the history of the nation and certainly the pacific northwest i hope that when people drive by the sign that directs them to the refuge maybe they will feel a little of that billy magic too maybe they will wonder well who was this billy frank jr what did he do for those of us who knew him it will be a frequent reminder of this hero they say you die twice the first time and the second time when they stop speaking about you it is our goal that they never stop speaking about billy frank jr and the lessons he taught us all the refuge will be a constant reminder i knew billy for almost 40 years i loved him like a beloved uncle in fact i called him uncle billy but i was absolutely not special in that regard hundreds if not thousands of people did the same thing indeed at his memorial service the official estimate of the number in attendance was 10 000 that is how beloved this

like to especially recognize chairman bishop ranking member grijalva and the hardworking committee staff both for the majority and the minority for their help on this legislation in conclusion billy

pulling this special order together and for their hard work on the bipartisan task force to address this heroin epidemic as the heroin epidemic sweeps the nation too many families and communities are mourning the deaths of loved ones who have been lost over the years due to heroin addiction and addiction to painkillers one of the lives we lost not too long ago was in a town called rockford illinois which is in the heart of my congressional district the gentlemans name was chris boseman he was 32 years old when he died in the summer of 2014 he was a kind tenderhearted son and brother he had a back injury that led to his addiction to pain medication when he could no longer get relief from that pain medication he began to buy different kinds of pain relief on the street as the costs would add up his dealer told him about something called heroin and that he could get this for 10 after his first overdose chris tried hard to fight his addiction he had a couple of relapses but it appeared that he had been successful in overcoming this addiction he enrolled at rock valley college a community college where he studied construction management he was 1 year away from graduating no one knew that he was still fighting this battle because he was ashamed of it one night he was home alonehe was just over 1 year cleanwhen he relapsed again and died the sad thing is that chris story is all too common in fact i lost a member of my own family to the heroin epidemic when my brotherinlaws son died after overdosing on heroin in the summer of 2013 he was not the kind of kid one would think would be taking something like heroin his dad had no idea his family had no idea he was a college football player he was a musician he was an avid weight lifter and was just a redheaded kid who was fun to be around yet when he injured his back and his knee and felt that he needed more than just aspirin and a little physical therapy to overcome this pain he got on painkillers as we are telling these stories this evening this eventually led to his trying heroin as a way to relieve his pain it was probably they thought the third time that he took heroin he ingested what would be considered pure heroin and he died i am here to say that we can no longer sit on the sidelines while folks in our communities and our family members are suffering and are dying when parents are burying their children and when the men and women who are struggling with this addiction are crying out for help we also know that heroin use is increasing among young people especially in my home state of illinois with a nearly 50 percent increase in the use of heroin just in the last several years in winnebago county which is where rockford is which i was talking about earlier there were 51 heroinrelated deaths in 2013 alone in peoria which is also in the heart of my congressional district emergency responders see at least one heroin overdose every single day perhaps the most troubling is not just this rapid increase in the usage or in the rising number of overdoses but in our inability to treat those who need it the most while heroin use is increasing rapidly in every region of my home state there has been a dramatic decrease in the availability of treatment in fact illinois ranked worstlast in the nationin the overall decline in treatment capacity while we are at the height of this heroin epidemic last year our governor proposed a budget that would cut our already inadequate statefunded treatment programs by 60 percent to make matters worse the ongoing budget crisis in illinois has gutted the funding for treatment programs like one in my district of rockford it is called remedies renewing lives that is why next week when the president gives his state of the union my guest will be a guy named gary halbach who is the president of remedies it is so he can witness the state of the union and so he can talk about the important work that he and his colleagues at remedies are doing every single day under the pressure of tremendous budgetary shortfalls gary and his team have been on the front lines in providing treatment to heroin addicts and support for

making substantial changes to the cftcs internal operations and rolling back key doddfrank provisions intended to strengthen our financial regulatory framework i have specific concerns with the new costbenefit requirements imposed in title ii of the legislation the cftc already conducts costbenefit analyses on its rulemakings and this provision could significantly slow down the rulemaking process while also creating openings that will put the cftc at the risk of increased litigation title ii of h r 2289 also proposes several unnecessary changes to the commissions internal operations that can make it more difficult to manage the agency according to cftc chairman massad the provisions contained in title ii could weaken the commissions ability to respond in a timely and effective manner for example if these measures were currently in place it would have made it more difficult for the agency to positively respond over the past 10 months to concerns raised by market participants also included in this bill are substantial changes to rulemakings taking place at the commission under the doddfrank act i am particularly concerned by the crossborder language contained in the bill which will undercut the efforts already underway by the commission to negotiate on an international system of safe and robust derivative rules that are necessary to apply to the global derivatives market h r 2289 requires the cftc to create a rule that will automatically allow unitedstates banks and foreign banks conducting business in the unitedstates to do so under the rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions all of which are currently more lenient than our own we have seen this kind of race to the bottom before and we all know how it ends worse yet is that this legislation hamstrings an agency that is already woefully underfunded the congressional budget office estimates that the cftc will need 30 additional personnel annually to handle the increased workload imposed by both the new costbenefit analysis requirements and the mandated crossborder rule contained in this legislation will my friends on the other side of the aisle provide the necessary funding increases to the cftc to carry out these requirements i doubt it doddfrank significantly expanded the cftcs role in overseeing our financial markets and they have already completed over 80 percent of their required rulemakings the best rate of any financial regulator they have done so despite the fact that congress has not done its part to provide the agency with the resources it needs to police these incredibly complex markets populated by highly sophisticated and extremely powerful entities remember aig the insurer brought down by derivatives trades that the cftc is now policing if that memory is fuzzy i am sure you will remember the funds we provided to bail aig out which came to a total of 67 8 billion that would be enough to fund the cftc at the level requested in the presidents budget for over 200 years the commission needs a reauthorization but it certainly doesnt need one saddled with changes that will hamstring its internal operations prolong its rulemakings through an inflexible costbenefit

talk about the statutory obligations of epa we might have differing opinions i think they should have the authority we should remove the small site exemption and they should look at emissions from the fracking industry and the extraction but that is a valid discussion to have instead of that we are saying you are doing what we told you to do but we want to grant a stay so congress under the epa in section 112 directed the epa under the clean air act to promulgate these regulations president george bush did so they were tossed out and now there is a new set of regulations going forward to implement what congress wanted the epa to do now if the gentleman from alabama doesnt want the epa to do that lets have that discussion about epas authority i am happy to do it i have ideas maybe there are some areas the epa shouldnt have that mandate authority there are other areas like making sure we look at emissions from fracking where we need enhanced authority because there is something called the small site exemption in the clean air act where even though each particular fracking pad has a very small contribution to air quality when you start having thousands of them in a limited areawhich we doit starts looking a lot less like a couple automobiles and a lot more like a large industrial factory so they shouldnt be exempt just by nature of being small because when you have a lot of small things it equals not only one big thing it equals 10 big things and 100 big things we have over 40 000 active wells in the greater weldlarimer county area alone and there is an enormous impact on our air quality which is exempt under the small site exemption so again section 112 directs the epa to promulgate these rules if we want to open up the mandate that congress has given the epa lets have that discussion as an individual legislator i might trade you this brick kiln authority if we can close the small site exemption i would say fine my constituents care more about closing that small site exemption than they do if there are two brick kilns in our entire state so i think in general my constituents and coloradans care more about making sure our air quality is good and protected with regard to the emissions from the fracking activity than from the two brick kilns so i would be open to that as a legislative compromise that is how legislation is made but we are not allowed to have that debate the gentleman mentioned oh no amendments were brought forward guess what we did a motion in the rules committeei am sure the gentleman from alabama remembersyesterday to do an open rule on this if that had passedand it failed on a partisan vote not a single republican voted to allow an open rule on this bill if that had succeeded if that had passed that open rule the democrats wanted we could then introduce amendments like the ones that i mentioned to talk about the authority of the epa or other issues that we have to improve the statutory requirements in charge of the epa right on the floor we would have the opportunity to do that instead we have an entire day on brick kilns without even being allowed to introduce amendments that affect our clean air and water in any way shape or form i think we can do better the gentleman also asked what the impact of the brick kilns on this is the epa estimates that the brick and clay rule would reduce national air toxins by approximately 375 tons in 2018 again that is what congress has told the epa to do under the clean air act if congress wants the epa to do something different lets have that discussion section 112 other sections of the clean air act of the mandate that congress has given the epa lets not use a court procedure a stay that wont become law to shortcircuit something that congress has told the epa to do it is positively schizophrenic for congress to require an agency to do something and then say we are not going to allow you to do what we told you to do i reserve the balance of my
