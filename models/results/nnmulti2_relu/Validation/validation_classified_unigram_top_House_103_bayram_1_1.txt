subject as we enter into the debate on a social issue that will impact the lives of every american every man woman and child in this country what could be more important than taking time to discuss the pros and cons i was delighted as i am sure my colleagues were today to see that the bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for weeks now many many hours in length were rewarded were fruitful in coming out and announcing today a bipartisan health care proposal so we really have a debate now we have a clintongephardt we have a clintonmitchell bill and we have a health care reform bill with bipartisan support that deals with the health care crisis in this country from the standpoint of private sector reforms to expand coverage to more americans than ever before and to begin to control the spiraling costs in health care i think there are a number of things out there in the public sector right now to assist us as we look at this health care debate one of the books recently published written by dr jane orient she is an internist in tucson arizona and she heads the association of american physicians and surgeons with over 4 000 members nationwide the title of her book is a very timely book indeed your doctor is not in i think she provides us some important insights let me share a few of them she says first of all the proposed remedies for the health care crisis are snake oil and you shouldnt swallow them further the private doctor is an endangered species in the end we will have a herd a nice placid socialized tamed cudchewing herd readers should care about the plight of doctors for one and only one reasons some day they might need one you may think you know what the hippocratic oath says but you probably dont and you should learn about it before they do away with it entirely the hippocratic oath is built on physician autonomy it reads i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment eurther do you want your doctor to place society or the department of health and human services ahead of his being independent she says further managed care is about preventing medical care in order to make money for thirdparty payers or to save money for the government behind the slick advertising managed care is little more than prepayment for rationed health care rationed care is one of the most disastrous things that can ever happen to the health care practice in this country then i conclude with her insight there is no utopia i will only maintain that a free market in medicine is the best of the avallfble alternatives and the one that does the least harm that is what doctors do the least harm that is what the hippocratic oath says the way we do the least harm although it is not perfect is to maintain a free market in the health care system another recent book a novel published entitled fatal cure by robin cook a bestselling novelist he as a physician as a doctor imagines what will happen to the health care service industry in this country should we resort should we go in these coming weeks to governmentrun health care system i only share with the listeners this evening and with my colleagues a couple of paragraphs of the dialog that he imagines might take place some day he says everyone knows that doctor patient relationships are the cornerstone of medical care one of the characters says maybe thats passe the current reality is determined by a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena i am afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care the problem is washington every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one dr cook is absolutely right that would be the result of governmentrun health care in the washington post not exactly an advocate of freeenterprise health care certainly one that has espoused the governmentrun health care in its editorial policies dana priest in a frontpage story entitled health bill may have no substitute for bureaucracy he writes just recently president clinton and members of congress last week hailed the senate democratic leaderships health bill as a vast improvement over the bureaucracyladen 1 462page plan produced by the white house but the 1 410page bill proposed by senate majority leader george j mrrchell dmaine also would create dozens of new federal and state agencies they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce the way medical care is bought sold and to a lesser extent practiced in this country and indeed the post is right they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce i understand that the clintonmitchell bill in the senate has over 20 new federal bureaucracies that will be created now before i yield back to the gentleman i want to share a letteri am from the state of arkansas i have served 8 years in the arkansas legislature with nowpresident clinton our president was then my governor our chief executive in the state of arkansas many times during those 12 years that he was our governor the issue of abortion and more specifically the issue of public funding of abortion arose in various debates in arkansas as it has been throughout our country a major issue and it continues to be a major bone of contention and a major issue in the health care debate in every major governmentrun health care plan that has been presented to this congress the provision for reproductive services or abortion services if you will has been included that means that every american under a governmentrun health care system would be subsidizing the practice of abortion regardless of what their moral conscience or religious convictions would be september 26 1986 governor clinton then governor wrote in a letter to the arkansas righttolife people a letter in which he said in part because many of the questions do concern the issue of abortion i would like for your members to be informed of my position on the states responsibility in that area i am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions we should not spend state funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong that was governor clinton who is now president of the united states saying he not only opposed abortion but he opposed public funding of abortion and believed it was wrong to require people who believe it is wrong to pay for abortions and yet today he has included that insisted on including that in every governmentrun health care program that he has advocated and supported then i would concludeand i am indebted to our colleague from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from minnesota tim penny democrat for his dear colleague letter in which he points out something that i think is vital in this debate in the coming weeks he points out that major votes of the 20th century on large social policy changes have always been accorded overwhelming bipartisan support he enumerates some of those the social security act of 1935 96 percent of the democrats supported that 81 percent of the republicans supported that and it passed by a vote of 372 to 33 the development of the interstate highway system federalaid highway act of 1956 major policy change in our country 93 percent of the democrats supported it 98 percent of the republicans supported it passed by a vote of 388 to now the civil rights act of 1964 what more significant social change has this congress enacted than the civil rights act of 1964 sixtyone percent of the democrats supported the civil rights bill 80 percent of the republicans supported the civil rights act and it passed by a vote of 290 to i could go on the clean air act the medicare act the water pollution act all of these passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities here we are told that we must in the coming weeks have a health care reform bill that is going to affect the lives of every american the biggest social change in 50years and we are going to do it with the barest of majorities it is going to be forced through in spite of overwhelming opposition not only by the republican party but the polls indicate by the american people when the buscapade came to town i saw the big banners on the side saying pass it now and i said to myself pass what now at that point we did not even have a bill no one had read a bill yet they say we have got to hurry it through we have got to do it now yet the polls say 65 percent of the american people say they want to wait they want to read it want to study it want to react to it and that is the way major social change ought to take place it ought to take place with the american people aware of it the american people supportive of it and with a large bipartisan majority supporting it in congress we do not have that and that is~why we ought to wait on health care reform i thank the gentleman"], [2.8823365028074477e-06, 2.8823365028074477e-06, 0, "i am going to speak today on the bryant bill a grassroots gag rule i want to alert my colleagues that they should have in their office right now a letter to members of congress from the christian coalition entitled stop the gag rule on free speech vote no on the lobbying disclosure conference report i urge every member to read that because i do not think that members realize that buried in this socalled lobbying bill is a deliberate grassroots gag rule designed to kill precisely the pressure from back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington it has been the grassroots who have risen up the crowning blow to liberals was the grassroots opposition to the clinton health plan which stopped in its tracks an effort to create a big government big bureaucracy big tax health plan now what do we have we have in the bryant conference report an effort to strangle grassroots efforts i urge every member get a copy of this report and look at the specifics i am going to give you today so you understand this is not some scare story this is a danger of the clinton administration getting even this is the clinton revenge bill to get even with the grassroots activists this is what they say this is in the bill page 5 grass roots lobbying communicationsthe term inside grass roots lobbying communications means a any communication that attempts to influence a matter described in in these various clauses through an attempt to affect the opinions of the general public this is not lobbying the congress but informing the general public b any communication between an organization and any bona fide member of such organization to directly encourage such member to make a communication to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official with regard to any matter described here again not lobbying the congress but if you belong to a group and you try to talk to your own group this is now going to be described by the bryant gag rule as something inappropriate c any communication between an organization and any bona fide member of such organization to directly encourage such member to urge persons other than members to communicate in other words if you are anywhere in america and you decide you want to lobby congress up to 10 percent of the time you are paid for and you spend over 2 500 which is one round trip from los angeles and hotel spending one trip from that point on under these rules you are going to be subject to the registration act and you are going to have to report to the director of registration who is the director of registration going to be for 5 years longer than a presidential term it is going to be somebody appointed by bill clinton let us say roberta achtenberg for example is appointed a vehemently in the case of elders anticatholic person now we have a question is a papal message on school prayer political or is it religious is a papal message on homosexuality political or is it religious is a papal message on righttolife political or is it religious i happen to be baptist but i would say that those people who are worried about joycelyn elders anticatholicism ought to ask what would that kind of person do in the directors office by the way the director can assess a fine of up to 200 000 now you are a local grassroots organization out here let us say you are an antitax organization yes you do the horrible thing of actually seeing your member of congress lobbying you actually pay one member to do this part time and they spend 10 percent of their time seeing the illinois delegation they are now subject to filing every report as directed by bill clintons appointee if they do not they can be fined i believe 10 000 per occasion this is madness i ask my colleagues read pages 5 6 and 7 of this particular proposed bill the bryant gag rule let me just close and say that i hope this does not come up tomorrow i hope we have several days

me begin this process by first congratulating the gentleman from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the deficit and gets america back on the path to prosperity by asking govemmem to sacrifice not

mexico the first women members factfinding mission in over one decade i would like to enter my full remarks into the record but this evening i wish to say that this was the first ever congressional women members delegation to mexico we were there for over 4 days and our focus was extensive investigations and discussions with individuals from the government as well as the ordinary people of mexico regarding the proposed north american freetrade agreement the bipartisan group of members titled our mission the human face of trade we wanted to open up this agreement and take a look at what it meant not just for the people of the united states and canada but for the people of mexico as well because of course the ordinary people of mexico will not have a chance to speak out on this agreement in that oneparty state our delegation began its journey in mexico city by first meeting with minister of commerce jaime jose serra puche the delegation also met in mexico city with a broad array of environmental humanrights religious and labor organizations comprised of ordinary citizens both in mexico city and in the border communities that we traveled to just south of brownsville tx and mcallen tx in matamoros and reynosa mexico while we were in mexico city our delegation conducted the first ever binational meeting with women legislators from all political parties from both the united states and mexico this event occurred at the home of united states ambassador to mexico john negroponte our delegation visitdd barrios in mexico city and colonias on the border in the matamoros and reynosa we spoke at length with the people who lived there under appalling conditions our delegation discussed border area issues with the residents there with the socalled maquiladora workers who work in the unitedstates companies located south of the border we met with local government officials industry leaders and others gov ann richards of texas made a special effortto fly down to mexico and join our group for an evening of very frank discussions i might say about the proposed nafta agreement our delegation returned from our mission to mexico with these major findings first it is absolutely necessary that the united states and mexico take the time necessary to shape a continental agreement that encompasses the full range of economic social and political issues attendant to such integration the current treaty does not even come close to what is needed the dislocation of jobs of people who have been thrown out of work in the united states and in canada already by unregulated trade confirms the dangers of continuing a handsoff approach to a narrowly cast trade and tariff agreement that does not address these broader issues this is especially true where wage disparities and living conditions are as divergent as they are in the united states and mexico the majority of our meetings were with mexican women who have been most affected by trade policy we have met thousands of united states workers who have lost their jobs to these companies that have located to mexico largely united states companies now over 2 000 of them south of our border with mexico but it is interesting that over 70 percent of the people that have been hired to work in these relocated plants are women mexican women women who live at a subsistence level in fact we met one woman who worked for zenith corp who after 10 years of seniority with our unitedstates company located south of the border takes home for 48 hours of work in a week 15 75 that is her net pay mexicos rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to fe3d and house their families we met many of these people highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to lowwage maquiladoras operating in mexico we visited many of these runaway plants along the border but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers in fact that was a misconception i had i went down there and i thought if i met the workers in mexico who are workers in these united states firms that have relocated their standard of living would be a little bit higher than people who would be working for mexicanowned companies i found that was not true in fact as you look at what has happened in mexico the rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to feed and house their families we heard that between 35 and 40 percent of the people of mex ico are now part of what we call the informal sector of their economy that means they do not really get a paycheck that means that they are out there selling chiclets on the street their children are performing as little clowns on the corners to try to pick up little bits of money that they can take home to buy beans and rice for their families it is truly a lowwage economy highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to these lowwage companies but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers but have resulted in a double tragedy because of the subsistence wages that workers are paid so not only do united states workers lose their jobs here but mexican workers earn so very little money that there is not any way for those wages to produce the great booming consumer market that we hear so much about from the proponents of this agreement and why because el pacto the wage agreement between the leaders of the government of mexico industries that have located there and official unions have held wages to onetenth of united states levels in fact even though the government claims there has been an 8 percent increase in wages in mexico over the last year inflation down there in fact is running at 15 percent and interest rates are 35 percent so there is no way for the average family down there to upgrade their standard of living in fact workers in mexico have seen their real wages decline over the last decade and all economists will agree on that we met with apparel workers in mexico city who earn 40 cents an hour we visited people in mexico city neighborhoods who asked us to help them in their efforts to gain the right to food as a part of mexicos constitution because so many of their friends are hungry and we met with them in their neighborhoods saw where they lived went to the neighborhood stores that they tried to set up in a kind of cooperative way trying to buy beans and rice so that they can subsist i asked them how do you define poverty thinking that they would give me a dollar or peso figure definition they said we define poverty as anyone in our country who has less than 60 percent of the calories needed on an average day to merely meet subsistence levels of food and nutrition further it became clear to us that united states companies operating in mexico along with mexicos own domestic firms have enjoyed the addltional advantages of extremely lax enforcement of environmental and labor regulations as well for anyone with a conscience it is disturbing to view the conditions under which the majority of mexican people live our delegation would like to highlight these specific findings and over the weeks we will be bringing more of this information forward to the american people first of all access for mexicans including all of its elected representatives even the fledging opposition party to information about the ongoing trade negotiations we were asked for copies of the proposed treaty the people of mexico have so little information about what is being proposed that the ordinary people including some of their own elected representatives do not have information from the ruling party that information is now tightly controlled by the mexican government inhibiting informed policy making we also were asked that we as members of congress pay more attention to the human impact of mexicos recent economic policies which has gone largely ignored in this country these impacts include unemployment that is approaching 40 percent changes in mexicos land ownership system for its farmers that will drive 10 million more people off the land these people are wandering through mexico flocking into some of the large cities they no longer are growing their own food this is not an inconsequential issue it has an impact on our own immigration policy and also has an impact on whether mexico will be able to become the stable economy as our closest neighbor we saw the inability of wage growth to keep pace with inflation we also noted that mexicos foreign debt has also climbed despite their efforts to try to lower it from s89 billion to 103 billion now the severe economic restraints that they have put on their own people have not resulted in mexico being able to pay off the debts that it owes to foreign banks that is a huge part of the problem they are facing we received a request from concerned mexican scholars that united states and the press investigate the structure of mexicos stock market which they claim is controlled by mexicos wealthiest families allowing them to manipulate it for their profit profit for a very few we received a comhplaint by border communities that the mexican government assesses a housing tax on the lowpaid workers in these maquiladora plants which amounts to over 62 5 million cumulatively last year but these funds were not returned to the border area where housing is desperately needed and where environmental cleanup is desperately needed we received a request that our congress give more attention to the mexican governments preparation of its environmental inspectors which may be inadequate to train them to recognize instances of environmental noncompliance in fact we were told that the average inspector most of them having just been hired because of this agreement being talked about they received about 45 hours of training the north american freetrade agreement as negotiated will not contribute to the promise of raising standards of living for the families of all three nations the negotiated agreements narrow focus on tariff and investment barriers overlooks issues which a true free trade agreement must address real enforcement of labor and environmental laws wage disparities in exportoriented industries accessible dispute resolution which provides justice to citizens and businesses of all three nations and implementation of the polluterpays principle to fund desperately needed environmental cleanup and infrastructure improvements we need more attention to the human rights issue and to the electoral process in mexico itself which even makes their presidential elections called into question because of the manner in which people are treated at the polls and the way votes are counted the gradual and successful integration of the countries of the european community should serve as a model for our own continent we invited the mexican women parliamentarians from all parties to continue discussions with us on these important questions we will reissue that invitation our delegation intends to continue meeting as a working group we are in the process of preparing a detailed report on our findings that we will use to share with our congressional leadership members of congress president clinton and other administration officials as well as the american people we also hope to work with the office of the trade representative to ensure that negotiations on naftas parallel agreements fully address our concerns currently they do not this factfinding mission to mexico was the first step on a journey that will not end until we forge an agreement with mexico that will truly benefit the families of both of our countries and all countries on our continent i thank the chair for its patience this evening"],

congresses toward adopting mussolini rules in the house of representatives mussolini rules are those that follow the handbook of benito mussolini who wanted to make the trains run on time but resorted to fascism to do that mussolini rules in the house are those that want to make the house run on time but destroy democracy in order to do it let us see here during the 95th congress just a few short years ago about 85 percent of all the rules were open rules in other words allowed free and open debate allowed middleclass america to have their views heard on the house floor guess what as middleclass america has become more and more disgusted with the congress and has found what congress is doing undermining everything they believe in open rules have declined to tho point that in this congress they have plunged to nothing today we have another mussolini rule on the floor that gives us no chance for open debate whatsoever what has happened about closed rules as middle america has found that congress is not doing what they wish congress has more and more resorted to closed rules until we get to this congress when every rule brought to the floor is a closed rule what does that tell us it tells us that the american people are being shut out of this body it tels us that the democrats majority can no longer allow the american people to have their say i suggested that this was going to become a part of a pattern here in a colloquy a few minutes ago and i was told that no such thing was said in the rules committee about this becoming a pattern now i am not allowed to quote from the transcript of the rules committee but i can paraphrase it and everything that i said was absolutely true in that colloquy between the gentlewoman from new york and the gentleman from south carolina in which they talked about the fact that the only amendments that should be allowed on the floor under anything other than emergency conditions should be those that come up in the committee well what does that mean it means that we are not going to have a chance for members of congress representing 565 000 of their constituents to have their opportunity to offer amendments on the floor that means that middle class america is being shut out of the house floor and it is being done purposely and the rules committee has every intention of continuing the pattern the gentlewoman from new york referred to the fact that there was a long debate over the department of education some years ago and it went on for some days and what they do not tell you about that debatewhat they do not tell you about that debate that she refers tois the fact that they checked with their former republican colleague mr horton about this and mr horton was a proponent of the department of education he did not like that long debate and i will tell members why because when they went into that debate they had a 100vote margin and they were going to win the thing by 100 votes after the debate and after that bill was defined for the american people they only won by four votes because the debate did change minds the fact is that that is what often takes place when you allow free debate on the house floor when middleclass america has their opportunity to be heard on the house floor every once in a while minds are changed every once in a while we move ahead the democrats know that if we are able to expose their legislation and their programs to the light of day that middleclass america will not agree with them and they will have a chance we will have a chance of reversing some of that legislation on the floor they do not want that to happen and so the trend is clear mussolini rules are winning more and more of the open rules are being declined and mussolini rules are going up so in

range was not protected a century ago when the park was set aside because every other section of the area was granted to the railroads as payment for the transamerica construction this ranges importance to the integrity of yellowstone has never been questioned however and it has essentially remained wild ever since this range is the home of the largest elk herd in america along with countless other species including the endangered grizzly bear the range also is the headwaters of some of the most pristine streams and rivers anywhere in this country the first attempt to consolidate these lands happened in 1925 and since then there have been countless attempts to bring the gallatin range into federal ownership the federal government has already spent more than 12 million to acquire elk winter range and the house of representatives had held countless hours of testimony on the importance of these lands the house itself passed no fewer than three bills to complete these land trades and purchases but still the range remains chopped up in checkerboard land ownership not long ago the railroad sold its land to a private timber company to avoid a hostile takeover and the company has since again sold the lands to several new owners interested in timber and development part of the new sale arrangement requires that timber be provided off the private lands and so now we face a serious problem if we do not solve these intermingled land problems by the time the contractual harvest is necessary the days of the gracious corporate neighbor in and around the gallatin are over and increasingly important recreation lands will be subdivided posted off limits or sold for private hunting rights if this legislation is not signed into law i helped bring the various parties together last year and we hammered out this agreement without this agreement in the gallatin and because we face a june deadline the company will soon enter and log the nationally significant porcupine drainage with the public losing precious recreation opportunities and scarce public access i am committed to seeing this does not happen and i am hopeful that we can continue to move quickly to assure these lands are brought into public ownership the local landowners are in agreement conservation organizations and local environmentalists are in agreement the park service and forest service are in agreement and we need the congress and the president to act this opportunity dreamed of since 1925 must not be lost and itshows the continued support of this committee and the congress in seeing that this job is done i would like to note that some of the folks who are supporting this legislation as a way of showing the broad cross section of support for this bill they include all three members of montanas congressional delegation the governor of montana the local county commissioners the mayor of bozeman the montana outfitters and guides association the wilderness society the greater yellowstone coalition the cottonwood canyon homeowners association local snowmobile and motorcycle groups employees at the belgrade mill i would like to particularly note a statement that i received from the montana wilderness association flathead chapter regarding the lands in its area which are involved in the trade this statement is important because of some who believed that the lands in the flathead which are exchanged were not reviewed by the local environmental community they were in fact suggested by local conservationists as suitable for trading as this body knows this type of legislation is difficult to negotiate and even more difficult to pass through congress as custodians of our federal land congress must be very careful that any trade we consider meet the most stringent requirements of fairness and value the trade must clearly be in the publics interest and must fulfill public policy goals i take this responsibility very seriously and have never considered any public land trade without clearly knowing that these goals be met montana has been aggressive in consolidating lands and we have never had a problem to date only because with the help of this body we have assured that any consideration had clear public policy goals these trades in the gallatin meet those policy requirements and the 15 years i have been involved in this discussion have shaped these trades to assure they are in the public interest any changes in these trades or consideration of other trades also should have to meet the conditions applied to the gallatin exchange this legislation does not represent the end of the federal governments interests in the gallatin this legislation is just the continuation of an historic concern and this legislation will set a clear process to identify and as sure the continued protection of our national treasures in the greater yellowstone ecosystem i also want to note that there were some concerns recently raised by a local landowner group in montana about several of the sections traded from federal ownership in an area known as north bridgers there have been discussions brokered by my office and involving both the private landowners and the forest service which continue to seek assurances on appropriate guidelines for private harvest on traded lands the north bridgers these efforts also involve the identification of new land combinations and alternatives that help us better achieve protection of the local landowners and still achieve our goals i have worked with our two senators on these issues raised by the folks north of bozeman and i believe accommodation is possible within the framework of the legislation we pass today i will continue working with the senators as the bill is considered in the senate and to share with them my work on behalf of the north bridgers homeowners association it is only through compromise and hard work that these difficult land inholding situations can be solved and i remain committed to continuing in that effort"], [1.701804285403341e-05, 1.701804285403341e-05, 0, "i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding this time to me and i am obviously disappointed that this rule did not allow a variety of alternatives to come to the floor one of which the committee on rules had before them that an attempt to allow me to offer the 10percent checkoff debt buydown amendment which would give the american people an opportunity for the first time to check off on their tax form money to buy down the national debt and thereby at the same time reduce the deficit because if forces the government to match dollar for dollar every debt buydown dollar with a dollar of spending cuts this particular proposal not only balances the budget in 5 years but in 15

are people in this body who just do not want the american people involved in the process but at least it is something that deserves discussion on the floor it was an entirely germane amendment what i am told is that we were told at the committee on rules that we could not do this because it was not in the form of a substitute and they only allow substitutes well that is not right back in 1991 when we were debating the budget resolution for 1992 the gentleman from michigan offered a perfecting amendment he was given an opportunity because he is a democrat to come to the floor with something other than a substitute however when a republican goes to the committee on rules asks for a perfecting amendment asks for a procedural amendment republicans are told no you may only bring a substitute

debated thus far first of all on the budget resolution theygot 5 hours of debate on the democrat side we got 41 hours of debate that is pretty unfair they got their amendments we do not get our

and reducing the deficit and also for her very magnificent presentation and very clear presentation of the new direction that this deficit reduction plan will take our country i thank her very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in her special order tonight i am very pleased that the presidents plan as amended by the house and senate conferees turns out to be a very profamily plan it does this by its investments that it makes in people that helps at the very same time to reduce the deficit to give our people work not welfare and to give them hope not despair how does it do this well it is profamily in many respects one is its childrens initiatives that are contained in this package childhood immunization the family preservation and support act the mickey leland hunger relief act and the earned income tax credit in addition to the enterprise zones which will help create jobs in some of the areas of our country which need them the most i would just like to take a few minutes to elaborate on some of these points and then move on to some of the economic arguments that spring from these i believe that while these are profamily and they are investments in people they will help get this country moving as well as reduce the deficit as far as the immunization initiative is concerned president clinton said on our nation is the only industrialized nation in the entire world that does not guarantee childhood vaccination for all children it ought to be like clean water and clear air it ought to be part of the fabric of our life so spoke our president and he said that in the context of only 55 percent of our nations 2yearolds fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases in 1991 because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country with 55 000 victims 166 people were killed in the epidemic and 11 000 americans were hospitalized this could have been prevented next in the package i want to commend our president and conferees for putting funds in for family preservation 1 billion child abuse and neglect is an escalating national crisis of devastating proportions nearly 3 million children were reported physically sexually or emotionally abused or neglected last year 3 million children in our country and at least 3 children a day die from abuse most before their first birthday that is hard to imagine while tie number of children reported abused in fact more than doubled between 1981 and 1991 federal funding has been cut in half i am very pleased that the president and conferees included as i mentioned 51 billion in this package next the mickey leland childhood hunger relief act is a very important domestic antihunger initiative the most important introduced in the last 16 years i am very pleased that the president has and well we would like more money always but i think at this moment it is 2 5 billion for the mickey leland hunger relief act it would allow families in addition to the funds it also will allow families to deduct high shelter costs in the same way that elderly and disabled households do so at present this is very very important for our families who exceed 50 percent of their income for shelter it would also encourage payment and collection of child support and assist working families and children then in that package i conclude my focus there on the earned income tax credit this proposal substantially raises the level of credit for working families with children to lift working families out of poverty and provide the modest credit to very poor workers without children to help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open for all you would expect i say to my colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut that i would be supportive of a program that contained these initiatives being on the progressive side of the spectrum in this body and i am pleased that they are in the package again i think they not only help people they help reduce the deficit but i do want to turn now to some business voices which favor the package let me say first that the american people according to the wall street journal last week they reported that americans are expressing more support for president clintons economic plan as it nears its crucial final vote by a comfortable margin of 54 to 32 percent people say that the clinton plan would represent a step in the right direction and the survey indicates that many americans are sour on the conduct of mr clintons republican critics the american people support this plan i now want to address some of the business leaders last week 58 business leaders many of them republicans from across the country endorsed president clintons economic plan i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues and our listeners the comments of some of those business leaders chairman august busch of anheuserbusch said we applaud the fundamental fairness of your initial plan as well as the diligence with which you have worked to keep equity a cornerstone of the final product jerry pearlman chairman of zenith electronics said i strongly support your 500 billion deficit reduction plan and the selective spending cute and appropriate investments i have no doubt that your plan will meet the major challenge of reducing the deficit while stimulating economic growth job creation and investment further to this xerox ceo paul allaire said successful passage of the budget reconciliation bill is a critical step in restoring longterm economic growth and job creation the presidents economic program is a balanced approach that shifts national policy away from deficit spending and toward jobcreating investment the chairman of time warner gerald levin said this legislation is our only opportunity to move forward on the economic front to fail at this moment would have grave consequences for americans and american business around the globe i am proud to join you in encouraging swift and positive congressional action the ceo of tenneco mike walsh said the united states cannot continue to live on borrowed time and borrowed money we elected a new president because we wanted change now it is time to act not blink or quit the president is taking on one of the most critical issues we face as a country and it is time for us to stand up support him and start attacking the deficit and then finally the president of h r block harry buckley said the majority of h r blocks clients are middle and lowerincome taxpayers many of whom would benefit from the presidents plan to expand and simplify the eitc and distribute the tax burden more fairly throughout all income brackets the new york times said in its editorial last month antitax rhetoric poses a threat to the common sense when the american congressional conferees meet this week to begin the arduous task of reconciling the house and senate budget bill we want common sense to prevail over political rhetoric we want this house to pass this budget very strongly you i say to my colleague presented very convincing arguments and compelling evidence of why this plan will work and why it must be done i think that it is clear that from left to right from people to business it is clearly viewed that we must reduce the deficit we must create jobs we must invest in people we must pass this package again i commend the gentlewoman for calling

gentleman for yielding time to me i hope that middle america is paying attention to this debate because one of the most salient points that was just made was that president clinton has proposed what is called an economic stimulus package that is costing 16 5 billion and it is not even included in the budget that they are talking about all the deficit spending that is in that budget which is into the billions and billions and billions of dollars even though there is a 400 billionplus tax increase in there does not include this 16 billion socalled economic stimulus package that is filled with pork g it has got swimming pools in there for various communities around the country it has got gymnasiums in there for various communities around the country it has got parking garages in there it has got libraries in there these are things that local communities ought to pay for but taxpayers from around the country are taking care of their friends in alabama and their friends in florida and their friends in california with these porkbarrel projects and the thing that is most irksomeabout this if there is such a work is that the president has not even put it in this budget it is 16 billion more that is going to be added to the debt in addition to what this does i just heard from my colleagues this is going to increase the national debt by 586 billion over the next year i wonder how many other things we are going to have added to this debt over the next year certainly this 16 5 billion socalled economic stimulus package which i call pork package is going to be added in addition to it we have to start coining new words new definitions around here today i started one clintonomics remember reaganomics everybody criticized remember clintonomics because it is going to cost 1 4 million jobs in the next 4 to 5 years that is how many jobs we aregoing to lose at least according to most economists clintonomics and it is going to lead to a clintastrophy an economic clintastrophy find that in your lexicon if it is not there now it should be the first thing we ought to do is start addressing the problem of government spending just 10 years ago we had our first 1 trillion national debt now we are almost to 4 5 trillion in debt it took us 200 years to get to 1 trillion and less than 10 years to more than quadruple it and what are we doing instead of cutting spending we are raising your taxes more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and that is supposed to solve our problems remember that when you get your paycheck next year remember that when you pay your utility bill and you are paying 400 500 more for gas or electricity inyour home next year because that btu tax the bigtime unemployment tax we call it is going to be hitting each and every one of you the problem is this really concerns me is that the media has not really gone into the program and explained it to the american people it is no wonder to me that the people of this country want president clinton to succeed i want him to succeed but at the same time while he is succeeding i do not want to see him take the economy right down the tubes to a degree that is worse than what we have seen over the last 3 to 4 years we raised taxes in 1990 to the tune of 184 billion and what did it cost it cost us jobs and it cost us an economic recession now they are raising taxes more than double that sure we want president clinton to succeed but we want the economy to succeed even more and the way to make sure the economy succeeds and grows so that we create more jobs and do not lose them overseas is to cut government spending first that is the key government spending is out of control we brought in 500 billion in tax revenues 10 years ago now it is 1 2 trillion almost triplewhat we brought in 10 years ago yet we are still running 300 to 400 billion in red each year so raising taxes is not the answer since we raised taxes 184 billion in 1990 for every 1 in new taxes we have spent 2 70 so the problem is not that we are not getting enough revenue the problem is spending is out of control and they will not make the hard declslotis on cutting spending we had a proposal called the 2percent solution that would freeze all government spending and no more than a growth rate of 2percent per year over the previous year they would not let us even bring it out of the committee on rules to the floor that would have balanced the budget in 6 years without a tax increase that is the problem they want to raise taxes and they want to spend us into oblivion and they are going to do it unless america rises up and says no more no more the problem is they face a dilemma that benjamin franklin said the second continental congress faced and that is they have to either hang together or hang separately and they are swallowing very hard this huge tax increase of president clinton"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.999979498968969, 2.0501031031017192e-05, 1,

deployed away from home longer and remain underpaid relative to their civilian contemporaries if the presidents pay proposals were to be enacted within 2 years military pay would be a staggering 17 percent below comparable civilian pay one result would obviously be a worsening of the already troubling trends becoming apparent in recruitment and retention today for example an e1 a private makes

termination of easements and property used for public utility purposes at the manassas national battlefield park this legislation is necessary to avert a costly and public lawsuit that virginia power

avoiding development of this historic civil war battlefield site in so doing the national park service became the owners of an easement which virginia power previously owned and on which were constructed major electric power transmission lines because the general statute of limitations on condemnation claims expires in november virginia power would be forced to file a 60 millioir lawsuit

impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of

accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result

proven that a relationship exists between poor academic achievement school completion and juvenile delinquency by using mentors to work with atdsk youth as in the juvenile mentoring program we provide

abouthealth care i will spend a few minutes on that but i think the country is better off because we have heard a little bit more from the gentleman from connecticut who is so anxious to bring this house together and help us get a good crime bill i thank him for participating let me turn just for a few moments to the health issue i am fortunate also to have the gentleman from hawaii here who comes from a state where they have universal coverage where we have seen that it is possible to cover all citizens i am going to begin with just a few comments on the matter of senior citizens and how senior citizens fare in the health reform debate i think that all of us know and i have a special interest in this area going back to the days when i was codirector of the oregon gray panthers at home we know that medicare which was enacted in 1965 was just half a loaf it did not cover prescription drugs and longterm care and eyeglasses and hearing aids and many needs of the senior citizens in fact health costs have gone up so dramatically that now many senior citizens pay more outofpocket for their health care than they did when medicare began in 1965 this is especially the case because prescriptions a substantial number of seniors millions pay more than 1 000 out of pocket each year for their pharmaceuticals and millions more need longterm care cannot even get decent care in their own homes i think it is especially important in this health reform effort that any bill and particularly the bipartisan bills which in my view are so critical to getting this job done right adequately address the concerns of the nations senior citizens the majority leader the gentleman from missouri has taken an approach which i think has a strong consensus behind it what the majority leader is saying in his approach to dealing with the concerns of the elderly is that there are savings to be found in the medicare program there are areas where we can make the program more efficient without harming existing medicare services what the majority leader the gentleman from missouri seeks to do is to take those dollars saved by making medicare more efficient and in effect reinvesting them in new benefits and new services for seniors such as longterm care and prescription drugs i happen to think that that makes a great deal of sense and i have heard the majority leader to his credit indicate that he is very open to hearing suggestions from members of congress of both political parties on how that might possibly be improved upon there is another approach that is being discussed it is the one that was drafted and developed by our colleague the gentleman from georgia i have served with the gentleman from georgia on the health committee for a number of years and a more decent and caring individual in my view simply cannot be found than the gentleman from georgia but i think we have to do better for our senior citizens than the approach that is being offered in the rowland bill what the gentleman from georgia and a number of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle propose d6ing in their bill is in effect taking a substantial portion of the medicare trust fund more than 60 billion and simply spending it on matters unrelated to the elderly so here we are in a situation where we have a very rapidly growing aging population the demographics are relentless we will have many more seniors in our country yet the approach offered by our colleague the gentleman from georgia simply takes 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and spends it on unrelated matters instead of taking the approach that our colleague the gentleman from missouri has taken who wants to find medicare savings and reinvest them in longterm care and prescriptions the approach offered by the gentleman from georgia takes the 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and at the same time offers not one dime for prescription drug coverage and not one dime for longterm care as far as i can tell the only reason one would go and take money out of the medicare trust fund and not use it for prescriptions and longterm care is you basically subscribe to the theory that willie sutton gave for robbing banks as you will recall willie sutton said thats where were going to look because thats where the money is i can see why someone might offer that kind of theory but i think we can do better on a bipartisan basis for our countrys senior citizens i think we can do better by our elders who so often are getting clobbered by these rising prescription drug bills by longterm care costs and the key to doing better is to build on the efforts of the majority leader who is saying lets find savings in the medicare program there are efficiencies to be found and in order to help our nations seniors when we find those efficiencies we will take those dollars and plow them back into the medicare program to provide some relief to vulnerable seniors faced with crushing longterm care and prescription drug bills what i would like to do and wrap up if i might is describe a situation where we have one of the nations senior citizens who currently receives coverage through the medicare program describes how she would fare under the approach taken by the majority leader the gentleman from missouri and describes how i think it would be possible for us in the kind of spirit that the gentleman from connecticut has brought to the house this evening work together to kind of build a coalition in both political parties to make sure that in health reform our na tions senior citizens get a fair shake under the proposal offered by the majority leader the gentleman from missouri the nations senior citizens would continue to get coverage through the medicare program so right away we have a plank that i think both political parties can support there is no need to frighten the nations elderly no need to tear up the sidewalks and cause confusion but to start as the majority leader does by in effect building on the medicare program the second part of his effort is to make sure that our senior citizens continue to have a choice of plan with unrestricted choice of physicians or a managed care program this too is exceptionally important this too is something that i think members of congress of both political parties can support because i think if there is one thing the american people agree on it is that senior citizens and others in our country must have access to a widespread range of providers and plank no 2 that mr gephardt pursues in his legislation is also an effort in my view to try to bring together a consensus to make sure that seniors are well cared for the third area is the matter of prescription drugs under this legislation the majority leader tries to balance the need for concern about cost with making sure that our seniors start getting some relief from the skyrocketing prescription bills his proposal would add approximately 8 50 per month to a senior citizens premium so that there is going to be an additional cost but never again would a senior citizen have to pay more than a thousand dollars a year on prescription drugs i would like to emphasize how important i believe this benefit is because i remember from my days with the gray panthers constantly seeing instances where senior citizens could not afford their pharmaceuticals and seeing very detrimental health effects as a result many have heard the phrase that seniors are choosing between food and prescriptions i found in my years working with senior citizens is what was more likely to happen is not that senior citizens would have to give up all of their meals to cover prescriptions but what would happen is they could not afford to take all of their pills and their prescriptions in a timely way so if a physician told them to take three pills for example for 2 weeks maybe they would take three pills for the first 3 days of the prescription but faced with the prospect of not being able to afford their pharmaceutical bills after 3 days they would then have to cut back to two pills and then eventually to one pill because pharmaceuticals can be so cost effective in terms of a treatment arrangement when senior citizens are in that kind of situation not able to take their prescriptions in a timely kind of way what is very likely to happen is that their health problems will get worse some may eventually need hospitalization and it is simply not cost effective to ignore the need for some prescription drug relief for our nations senior citizens so i am very hopeful in the days ahead on a bipartisan basis the congress will build on the third plank of the majority leaders piogram for senior citizens and that is to ensure that is a fiscally responsible way a prescription drug program is started for our elderly the majority leader in his plan goes on there is coverage for annual mammographies there is mental health benefits there is not a total limit on the amount senior citizens would have to pay beginning in the year 2003 all of these in addition to the slowdown in the part b premium are i think very welcomed and measures that members on both sides of the aisle can support and support enthusiastically but i think it is also important to focus on the last part of the proposal for seniors offered by the gentleman from missouri and that is the creation of a new home and communitybased longterm care program for seniors i emphasize this again as much out of personal experience as anything else during my years of codirector of the oregon gray panthers i had a chance to work with seniors for many years in developing what i think has come to be regarded as really one of the nations finest longterm care programs at home in oregon we have a program known as project independence it is a program designed to keep our seniors at home as a result of this program we are saving money we are saving money while at the same time having one of the lowest rates of nursing home stays in the country we have in effect revolutionized geriatric care revolutionized health care for seniors in effect turned the system on its head by putting such a strong emphasis on costeffective home health care what this legislation does the legislation offered by the majority leader is in effect build on the model developed in oregon the oregon project independence program the majority leader did not start from scratch the majority leader did not make this up out of whole cloth he is effect looked to the models across this country like we see at home in oregon through project independence and that is what he modeled his home health care program around so i am of the view that if the congress and members on both sides of the aisle look to a new home and communitybased program build around what we have done in oregon and now a number of other states have come up with other very sensible kinds of models we will have a chance to do the best in health care for our seniors which is to do more of what they want which is to stay at home and be in the community and do it at a price tag that is less than what we face today when seniors are unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes so let me wrap up by saying it seems to me we are in effect presented with two kinds of alternatives one is the approach that we have from dr rowland which in effect takes 60 billion over the next 5 years and takes it out of the medicare trust fund at a time when we are going to have many more seniors at a time when the demographics are so clear it takes 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and instead of spending it on prescriptions and longterm care it spends it on matters unrelated to the concerns of the elderly that we are discussing tonight on the other hand we have the approach that the majority leader has zeroed in on which is in effect to find costeffective savings in the medicare program find savings in the medicare program that can be routed out without in any ways cutting existing medicare services the majority leader has said let us take those savings and reinvest them in the home and communitybased services for the elderly and prescription drugs i am very hopeful that in a bipartisan way as the gentleman from connecticut has done for us tonight on the crime bill i am very hopeful that i and the gentleman from hawaii and other members of congresd can work together in a cooperative kind of fashion in a bipartisan fashion so that we can make sure that our seniors have a dignified retirement so they are not wiped out by the crushing costs of longterm care and prescriptions and we do this in a bipartisan way as the country wants and we do it in this session of congress i yield to the gentleman from hawaii who has been such a strong advocate of health care reform because i know he believes it in his heart but also because he has seen it work day in and day out in his home state i am happy to yield to my friend"],

representatives and in the hands of the president to submit to congress clearly the act the nepa act does not apply to the action of a president but rather to agencies it was the ruling of the judge that it applied to ustr because the trade office he said really is an independent agency having listened to the debate last week we had on the floor on the budget for the treasury post office budget dealing with the presidents budget and what cuts might be made there i find this a rather astonishing view to come to the trade office is very specifically legally and otherwise a part of the office of the president and for good reason the president has exclusive authority over negotiating trade agreements and international affairs for the conduct of foreign policy and that is why the president ofthe united states has the trade office as a direct part of the presidents office so i think the judges basic premise that he started from was a fundamentally flawed decision"],

vessels to enhance sealift capabilities and maintain a presence in international commercial shipping of united states documented vessels the bill provides the ships and the men to serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency we cannot permit our national security to be placed at the mercy of foreign seamen on foreignowned foreignflagged vessels even with near unanimous global support the crews of some foreign flag vessels refused to carry war material into the persian gulf during the war this measure will provide employment for american merchant marinerscivilians who have proven their dedication and patriotism by their actions in every war which has threatened the wellbeing of the united states contrary to recent illinformed statements there is no recorded instance of any american merchant mariner refusing duty on a vessel during the gulf war the bill prevents the unitedstates from becoming dependent on foreign flag vessels manned by foreign nationals for our imports and exports this will protect american consumers and producers from foreign shipping dominance of our international trade h r 2151 improves the operating efficiency of the maritime security fleet by removing outmoded trade route restrictions and it improves upon the current system of the ship mortgage and vessel financing system the measure also stimulates a modest shipbuilding program by authorizing payments to american shipyards engaged in the construction of similar types of vessels the unitedstates must maintain a pool of skilled and experienced shipyard workers this bill seeks to amend and improve upon the merchant marine act of 1936 that act expanded the unitedstates flag merchant marine and strengthened the shipbuilding capacity of the united states it is not an exaggeration to say and i have said it before on many occasions that without the ships built and the merchant mariners trained with government support provided by the merchant marine act of 1936 the western democracies would have lost world war ii those members from districts along the atlantic coast from florida to maine should know of the terrible battle fought during that war just offshore by the german uboats against our merchant marine hundreds of vessels and thousands of lives were lost president roosevelt understood as did the axis powers that if our merchant marine was destroyed we would be unable to protect our allies and serve as the great arsenal of democracy we are fortunate with minor but tragic exceptions this country is not engaged in major military operations anywhere in the world 1993 was and i hope 1994 will bea year of general peace regrettably i hear the same arguments today that were used against the 1936 actthat the united states didnt need a merchant marine that we could save money by transporting goods on foreign flag vessels that we could rely upon foreign flag ships when we need them if the members of congress in 1936 had listened to the critics of the merchant marine we would not have had the ships and the men to secure victory in world war ih what will happen to our allies if the ethnic and religious persuasion of crewmembers of foreign flag vessels carrying military cargo causes the crewmembers to refuse to work i am sure we will hear the same tired old arguments to do away with the ship american provisions of the 1938 act that we have heard before i caution the younger members of this house to read their history before they vote to reduce the modest amount of cargo which the law requires to be carried on unitedstates flag vessels

point out a few things about the crime bill we are talking about common sense we are talking about a need to have tough crime laws well funded crime laws but we are not getting them in the billiondollar crime bill a lot of people have asked first of all is this really a crime bill theresponse is not exactly you ask the question doesnt this take out 19 assault weapons that are a scourge in the cities and causing crime all across the country and the response is not exactly the gun control portion of the crime bill goes far beyond 19 assault weapons in fact the assault weapons mrspeaker that most people think about the automatic weapons of mass destruction are already illegal under previous federal law one cannot make them more illegal even changing some of the semiautomatic weapons to full automatic weapons is a violation of federal law and here again you cannot make that more illegal it does however affect hundreds of sports weapons and weapons that today most people do not think of as automatic weapons i mentioned earlier this evening that my sons shotgun that he hunts tur keys with is classified as an automatic weapon because it meets two criteria and that is all it needs to meet of the list of criteria for shotguns that will determine that it is an automatic weapon it holds six shots it can only hold five it has a curved stockandit can fit a bayonet which has three as ipointed out myson has not been bayoneting any turkeys so he is not much of a threat with this weapon i suggested he put a bayonet on it and try it but i heard from the society against the bayoneting of turkeys that was formed this evening and objecting to that i am saying that somewhat in jest but when we think that there are weapons that we think of as ordinary sports weapons that will be classified under this law as automatic weapons you see that it is not exactly 19 assault weapons that it is going after but a number of weapons that meet the criterion of assault as defined and we find that only a small fraction of the crimes in my state less than onehundredth of 1 percent nationwide it is less than threetenths of 1 percent of the crimes committed are committed with these large assault weapons and then we ask the question did the president ask to increase law enforcement for this body well not exactly he came before the budget presented to the subcommittee on appropriations on which i sit on commerce justice and state and he asked to cut 847 fbi work force he asked to cut 200 agents from dea and he asked to cut the ins now that is not exactly bolstering law enforcement but you say i read a hundred thousand police are going to be added to the streets of this country well not exactly when you look at the funding that was passed by congress in fact we passed it today already through the conference report there is enough funding about 13 000 per officer and it is estimated the cost of maintaining that officer is between 45 and 65 000 it is estimated that you would be able to put approximately 20 000 officers on the street not a hundred thousand and they are not there for long periods of time first of all they have to be recruited not from reserves or necessarily officers that have applied at police departments already the have to be a special quota of people based on race and sex and other sorts of things this may meet the criterion of a given city and it may not but they will only be there for a few years and then the federal government withdraws the funding the funding runs out and it is left up to the local communities then to fund those police and so if they cannot fund them today it is not likely they will be able to fund them tomorrow so even the 20 000 police disappear and then we ask the question does this legislation give stronger sentences and tougher sentences you know there was all the talk about three strikes and youre out and stronger sentencing and all that sort of thing and so you ask that question and the answer is not exactly it releases 16 000 convicted drug pushers because it abolishes the mandatory sentences for those drug pushers in the racial quota section of it"],

freetrade agreement ranging from the question of exports versus imports the political situation the problems that mexico has faced which we all acknowledge are still there i think that as we look at this issue we should take the next few minutes to be very specific about some of the marvelous success stories that exist as it relates to the nafta now as we all know some of the most virulent opponents to the north american freetrade agreement stated as that debate raged last year that we would see the economies in the rust belt of the country devastated if nafta were to be implemented all of the jobs because of businesses flowing to mexico would be evaporating and they said to people like the gentleman from arizona and to me that yes you come from the western part of the united states your states border mexico and you will have real improvement but the rest of the country will pay the price from the implementation of the nafta so i would like to take a couple of minutes to start out by pointing to a few successes that exist in ohio now we know that some of the strongest opposition came from members of the ohio delegation and for starters as we look at the first 6 months the headline of this article chrysler starts shipping jeeps to mexico in january chrysler began shipping its first jeeps to mexico the company will ship about 3 800 jeep wranglers and cherokees to mexico from its toledo oh plant in 1994 thanks in part to lower tariffs as a result of the north american freetrade agreement that an article in the journal of commerce the jeep sales have also benefited suppliers to chrysler who are spread throughout that region then there is an article in the cleveland plain dealer axle maker sees silver lining from jeep exports with the export of nearly 4 000 united statesmade jeeps to mexico toledobased dana corp now has to produce more axles for the popular vehicles the chairman of the dana corp indicated in december of 1993 that the company may even close its plants in mexico and bring business back to the united states now that is a little different than what we heard last year during this debate on the nafta then if you look also in ohio cougar and thunderbird production moves from mexico to ohio the ford motor co announced in january that it plans to shift production of its cougars and thunderbirds from mexico to lorain oh ford plans to build an additional 8 000 thunderbirds and cougars this year in lorain using current workers on overtime a ford spokesperson who credits the nafta for the production move said the company may also move its production for the grand marquis from mexico to the united states the company is holding to its assurance that nafta would create not eliminate unitedstates jobs and plans to hire 550 workers as it realigns its north american operations"]]}
