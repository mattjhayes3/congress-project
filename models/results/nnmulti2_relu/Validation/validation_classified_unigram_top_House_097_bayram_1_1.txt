that we the delegates to the interparliamentary union might report to the congress and to the american people the results of that rather auspicious and important conference as you know the spring meeting of the interparliamentary union was held this year in lagos nigeria from april 12 through 17 i was honored to have been appointed as one of the delegates by our speaker i want to express my appreciation to my fellow delegates the honorable claude pepper who headed the house delegation and senator robert stratford who headed the general delegation i also express my appreciation to my other compatriots representative robert mcclory and representative caldwell butler representative mcclory is a senior member of the illinois congressional delegation and has been a stalwart moving force behind unitedstates participation in the interparliamentary union i also wish to express appreciation to certain esteemed public servants like the honorable donald easum former ambassador to nigeria and the president of the africanamerican institute who was in strumental in giving me some tremenduusly excellent briefings also mrs clara ossinulu the nigerian representative of the africanamerican institute the honorable walter carrington director of the department of international affairs at howard university and former unitedstates ambassador to senegal to the honorable abudu yesufu eke ambassador to the united states from nigeria and last of all to our own ambassador thomas r pickering and his excellent staff at the unitedstates embassy in lagos nigeria one must be aware both of the significance of the interparliamentary union conference in lagos and also of the very close ties between this country and the federal republic of nigeria which used the american constitution as a blueprint for its own democratic government the honorable alhaji shehu shagarl president of the federal republic of nigeria and commanderinchief of its armed forces stated in his opening remarks to the ipu thatthe interparliamentary union has over the years succeeded in establishing for itself a good reputation as an institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and scientific research csir the cyber 750 is one of the most advanced computers made in the united states and can be used for advanced nuclear research to model nuclear explosions and for breaking sophisticated encripted codes csir is an agency of the south african gov ernment research operation which has broad responsibilities which overlap americas nuclear regulatory agency bureau of standards and national science foundation two unitedstates companiesedlow international and swucoacted as brokers in the sale of highly enriched uranium fuel for south africas koeburg nuclear reactors in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend world the post was the largest circulation daily in south africa and the countrys principal black newspaper the government has refused to allow bishop desmond tutu to travel outside of south africa by revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and relocated them hundreds of miles from their families in impoverished semiarid rural areas the government has stepped up its bannings and detentions of both white and black student leaders including the banning of alexander borraine the son of a progressive member of parliament the government has continued to establish bantustans and to revoke the citizenship of blacks relocated to these areas i urge all my col leagues to pay 4 closer attention to events in this region i urge them to make clear that the commitments of the united states have not changed i urge this because i believe it is right and just because it is strategic and because it is the most prudent course of action for our own society at this point i ask that the following statement which i presented at the ipu meeting be included in the record"], [0.01450994610786438, 0.01450994610786438, 0, "3 years ago this legislative body took a positive step to encourage savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.015205979347229004, 0.984794020652771, 1, "the major goal of american health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [0.016306757926940918, 0.9836932420730591, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this is truly a historic debate we are conducting today in the unitedstates house of representatives not since 1969 when the country was going through the agony of the war in vietnam has the house conducted a debate such as the one we are engaged in today thirteen years ago this house talked about a war in a small country in southeast asia today we talk about global wara war that would end civilization as we know it the subject we are addressing today is the ultimate subject we can debate in this chamber the condition of the economy at if the silos are emptied there will be no economy we can argue for thi social program and that social program but after nuclear war there will be no society we can have one foreign policy initiative after another but if the warheads explode the entire international order and structure will be dismembered i commend representatives jim leach and matthew mchugh and the staff of members of congress for peace through law for organizing this debate it is long overdue representatives conte bingham and i have introduced a resolution in the house calling on the superpowers to freeze their nuclear arsenals and begin cutting back so far 160 members of the house have cosponsored this resolution a similar resolution introduced in the senate by senators kennedy and hatfield has attracted more than 20 cosponsors in that chamber but this discussion today is not the result of this resolution no this measure is part of a much largeri movement gaining strength in the country that movement has a clear and simple message enough is enough the arms race must be halted before we blow ourselves of the face of the earth the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers must be reduced and reduced drastically why has the public suddenly turned itself toward nuclear arms control and disarmament because the public is afraid the american people want a strong defense but they are afraid that the 1 7 trillion arms buildup of the reagan administration heats up an arms race where nobody wins they do not want nuclear war but they hear talk of nuclear warning shots from their secretary of state and limited nuclear war in europe from their president they do not want other countries to acquire nuclear bombs but they see nuclear trade policies from the admi istration that show that proliferation will be none of its business all across the country religious leaders business executives lawyers doctors college students and local legislators to name a few are organizing to demand a halt to the nuclear arms race the one initiative gaining momen tum nationwide is the proposal for the united states and the soviet union to freeze their nuclear arsenals so far more than a million people have signed freeze petitions in california a compaign is under way to place a referendum on the november state ballot calling for a freeze the campaign has collected about a half million signatures nuclear freeze groups have sprung up in 43 states and 279 congressional districts the massachusetts oregon and new yor4 legislatures have passed freeze resolutions more than 160 vermont towns have voted to support the freeze these are not people who want the united states to lay down its arms they are not advocating unilateral disarmament they are people with commonsense they are people who want both sides to stop the arms race the contemarkeybingham resolution is a response to that commonsense appeal the resolution calls on the superpowers to halt the arms race it calls on the united states and the soviet union to sit down and negotiate a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing production and further de ployment of nuclear warheads mis siles and other delivery systems it calls on the superpowers to then begin major mutual and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals yes there will have to be some giver and take at the negotiating table because of differences in both sides deployment cycles deciding on how to draw the line on testing production and deployment and figuring out how to cut back on the weapons will certainly keep the negotiators busy yes the process of implementing a freeze will be arduous and detailed but we have no choice but to begin that process for time is running out the arms race is getting out of control the overkill the two superpowers have amassed defies any rational justification the weapons states now have more than 50 000 nuclear weapons with a total explosive power equal to 1 million hiroshima bombs one poseidon submarine has enough warheads to cause 30 million fatalities in the soviet union more than it suffered in all of world war ii in europe alone the united states has one nuclear weapon for every 50 soldiers just 200 of the some 9 000 strategic warheads in the unitedstates arsenal would destroy every major city in the soviet union but now the american public is being told this overkill is not enough the administration wants to build 17 000 more bombs over the next 15 years i both the united states and the soviet union are in the process of deploying or producing a new generation of weapons deadly weapons like the soviet ss18 and the american mx missile that improve each sides ability to knock out the others missiles in a nuclear exchange and will put a hair trigger on nuclear deterrence both sides are taking technological leaps in the research and development of nuclear weapons that will make it more difficult to negotiate arms control treaties george kennan once said that the nuclear bomb is the most useless weapon ever invented it can be employed to no rational purpose but now we hear dangerous talk from the white house the state department and the pentagon about using nuclear weapons we hear talk of waging a nuclear war rationally of employing nuclear weapons as instruments of foreign policy we hear this laughable statement from mr t k jones a deputy undersecretary over at dod who says that everybodys going to make it if there are enough shovels to

on a program to relocate twothirds of the american public in case of a threat of nuclear war not only would this be a waste of money such a program would dangerously delude the public into thinking it can survive a nuclear holocaust and win when the bombs explode there will be no winners while the administration professes that it wants to deter nuclear war it is pursuingpolicies and developiqg weapons that could push us into a nuclear war we must now realize that spending more money on more nuclear weapons merely buys us more trouble our resolution has received quite a bit of criticism recently that criticism reached a low point with this ad from the college republican national committee which is an auxiliary of the republican national committee the ad says the soviet union needs you support a unitedstates nuclear freeze to imply as this ad does that the 160 representatives who have cospon sored our resolution22 of whom are republicansto imply that they are preaching moscows line is an affront to their integrity and intelligence to imply that rev billy graham and averell harriman and the more than 300 prominent individuals and organizations across the country who have endorsed this resolution are communist sympathizers does a monumental disservice to people who are committed to the security of america i also wish the administration would expend as much energy stopping the arms race as it has attacking our resolution the administration claims that our resolution would freeze the united states into a disadvantaged position with the soviets that is not true each side has advantages over the other in certain weapons systems but overall there exists a balance of imbalances between the two superpowers when administration critics talk about a disadvantaged position i would ask them which position they would rather have the soviets they have no bomber fleet to speak of their subs are noisy and easy to detect and more than threefourths of their missiles sit in vulnerable landbased silos or would they rather be in the american position half our missiles are in invulnerable submarines more than onefourth are on intercontinental bombers and we lead the soviets in warheads 9 000 to 7 000 the russians are not 10 feet tall we do a great disservice to our defense posture when we claim we are weaker than the soviets the fact is we have more than enough firepower to reduce the soviet union to rubble they know it we know it the american public knows it and it is about time the administration knows it the administration claims that our resolution cannot be verified that is not true a freeze and reduction in both sides nuclear armaments can be verified so each side be confident that violations affecting our national security would be detected in fact verification would be much easier if we freeze now and reduce the stockpiles than if we heat up the arms race and try to negotiate reductions as the administration proposes if we have a massive arms buildup as the administration advocates we will end up with more nuclear weapons that will be harder to verify when we go to the negotiating table the administration claims that our resolution undercuts the negotiations in europe that is not true both the soviet union and the united states have b en playing to the gallery in their neg aiations over a few thousand nuclear weapons in europe meanwhile the question of how we cut back on the 50 000 warheads stockpile worldwide remains ignored obviously the brezhnev proposal for a freeze in intermediaterange missiles in europe is inadequate but instead of rejecting that proposal out of hand as the reagan administration has done we should challenge the soviets to freeze and reduce all nuclear arms finally we now hear that the president plans to endorse a socalled freeze resolution in the senate sponsored by senators jacason and warner that is not good enough mr president the jacksonwarner resolution calls for a longterm freeze in other words it says let us build just a few thousand more weapons then lets talk about freezing the arsenals let us deploy the mx the b1 bomber and groundlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles then well stop it is the same old tired line the american public has been hearing from its leaders for the last three decades just let us complete the arms race and then we will talk about disarmament it will not wash the arms race can never be completed when we build more they build more when we mirv they mirv when we build the cruise missile they will build the cruise missile and the arms race will never end the american people are tired of excuses they are tired of being fed this baloney that we must arm to disarm they are afraid of all this talk from the reagan administration

to make sure they do not do more harm than good prime minister margaret thatcher several years ago using similar rhetoric about restoring the enterprise system sharply reduced funding for british social programs as the reagan administration now proposed to do the soaring unemployment rates and high bankruptcies that followed caution us against accepting promised results on faith i am not convinced for example that it makes sense to eliminate cetacomprehensive employment training actjobs throwing lowskilled employees back on welfare would not even be cost effective and it seems to contradict the workfare not welfare theme of mr reagan if some ceta programs are poorly managed and if some fail to train participants so they can successfully enter the private job market when their public jobs end i would favor the most rigorous efforts to correct these weaknesses but why throw out a program that reduces the human and economic waste of unemployment the proposed elimination of 1

federal funding is withdrawn they have three choicesto raise bus fares from 75 cents to an estimated 1 05 to seek further subsidies from local taxpayers or to shrink services the latter of course

will be sending to your committee shortly this supposed clarification still leaves me puzzled about what is contemplated for udag constituents who suggest that the democrats are holding back on

schedule to complete action on a new budget by midyear pennsylvania taxpayers have been getting back only 92 cents for every dollar its taxpayers send to washingtoncompared with 1 07 by taxpayers in the west and 1 12 by those in the south one of my tasks in reviewing the budget is to seek to correct this imbalance which amounts to subsidizing the drift of people jobs and industries from our area to the sunbelt it wastes energy and contributes to the instability of our great cities the barge operators inform me of another difficulty with the administrations proposals increased waterway user taxes and a program to recover the costs of the unitedstates coast guard are of particular interest to pittsburgh which handles more barge tonnage than any other inland port in the nation at a time of energy problems the fuel efficiency of barges should be encouraged not discouraged according to the american waterways operators a gallon of fuel can move a ton of freight 59 miles by truck 202 miles by rail but 514 miles by barge since coal and oil are major barge cargoes the energy implications are multiplied the question in my mind is not whether barge traffic should continue to pay for maintenance of the waterways it should but we need to make certain that this mode of transportation is being treated equitably with rail highway and air transportation i do not hesitate to give the president high marks on several counts he correctly targets inflation as a major problem he properly calls for reduced federal spending his initiatives create an atmosphere in which whole categories of federal activities that were previously off limits to economizers and reformers have been opened up for review it is in this spirit that i am seeking alternative methods of achieving the costcutting goals let me give two examples first it is not widely recognized that the treasury gives up more revenue each year 19 8 billionthrough income tax deductions for mortgage interest than it provides to poor people through all housing subsidies combined these deductions serve the useful purpose of stimulating homeownership however no limit is set on the amount a taxpayer may deduct for this purpose owners of mansions and vacation homes deduct all their mortgage interest payments out of all proportion to need i strongly favor consideration of a 5 000 ceiling on these deductions so the bulk of taxpayers do not have to pick up the tab for the wealthy a congressional budget office analysis indicates that the 5 000 ceiling would yield about 3 68 billion a year in additional federal revenue it would affect only 5 percent of all taxpayers and even they could deduct all but the excess over 5 000 if this modest reform were adopted half of the administrations proposed 1982 budget cuts could be restored in the following programs food stamps aid to families with dependent children ceta jobs elementary and secondary education basic education pell grants for college students legal services for the poor small business assistance housing and rehabilitation loans urban development action grants and support of the arts and humanities unlimited mortage interest deduction is but one example of a whole array of tax breaks or loopholes for the affluent that require serious attention before the needy should be deprived of basic help for food medicine shelter and jobs second everybody wants america to be strong with adequate wellequipped forces that can be deployed rapidly wherever they are needed and with a nuclear potential that is too powerful to challenge however i believe each addition to the defense budget should be treated with as much care as each cut from the nondefense budget as responsible a person as outgoing comptroller general elmer b staats pointed to several billion dollars a year in pentagon waste and mismanagement in a 23page letter to secretary of defense caspar w weinberger staats itemized such costreduction opportunities as consolidating adjacent military bases joint supply purchases improved management of weapons systems and multiyear contracting that would save an absolute minimum of 4 billion a year by 1985 opinion polls indicate considerable support for the presidents budget goals most of the mail which i receive in my office is written by individuals in general support of the presidents goals i should point out however that a good number of the letters contain a similarity in phraseology that may be more than coincidental be that as it is some of these individuals indicate in their letters that if i did not support the president i would be regarded as an obstructionist further i was also reminded in no uncertain terms that these individuals would remember me in a not too favorable light at the next election james wilson makes a point that each of the great powers executive legislative and judicial should be independent as well as distinct lectures on law the works of james wilson the division of the powers of the national government was established for a purpose and that was to avoid a concentration of power in any one branch i think the citizens of this country would be illserved if this body were to adopt the course of action recommended by some and that is simply to trust the president and approve his program without the needed scrutiny edmund burke in his speech to the electors of bristol stated that your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion the course of action advoctated by this administration deserves very careful examination because we are not simply considering a request for a reduction in federal expenditures we are considering a reordering of priorities the effect of which if adopted will be felt by many low and moderateincome individuals the programs which we are considering reducing are ones which meet the needs of those most in need of assistance we should examine these proposals very closely the economist in its latest issue states thatalthough the reagan budget attacks nearly 300 programmes including some dear to the hearts of even mr reagans supporters its main effect will be felt negatively on the poor and positively on the defense industry social justice should not be sacrificed on the altar of an untested economic theory and that it

recovery and represents a substantial departure from previous economic policies of higher spending and increased taxes last november 4 the american pcopole unmistakably recognized that it was these same policies which have led to sustained doubledigit inflation high unemployment and interest rates and a slowed national productivity growth i truly believe that unless we act now to change our past economic course these statistics based on the old policies of higher spending and taxation will continue to accumulate there are two very important reasons why i urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan substitute first it will restrain federal spenlding there can be no doubt that gloverment spending has literally exploded consider these facts payment of interest on the national debt for 1982 will almost equal the entire budget expenditures for fiscal year 1961 the national debt is more likely a national disgrace as it is currently just under 1 trillion washington presently spends 22 000 every second of every day in 1970 the government spent over 196 billion today we are considering a budget of 688 billion under the grammlatta substitute or roughly over 710 billion if all other proposed substitutes are considered by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute we will restrain federal spending to 6 1 percent in 1982 as compared to previous spending growth of 16 percent from 1979 to 1981 federal spending and revenues will decline to 19 3 percent of gnp by 1984 as opposed to 23 0 percent and 21 2 p~ercent presently for 1981 furthermore the grammlatta substitute proposes smaller spending levels than has been proposed by any of the other budget alternatives being considered by the house by at least 21 billion in fact spending by the grammlatta substitute is 6 5 billion smaller than spending proposed by the administration the important point is that by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute federal spending will still be larger than any prior year but it will be restrained many refer to the presidents proposal as cuttig the budget when actually all he is asking for is a reduction in the amount of increased spending for each year my second reason for supporting the bipartisan effort is that it leaves room for enactment of the reagan tax reform program which provides for sufficient tax relief to peopleespecially 97 million working peopleand to businesses the burden of taxes on individuals and businesses has become oppressive in 1965 only 6 percent of all taxpayers faced marginal tax rates of 25 percent or higher today almost40 percent of all taxpayers face rates of 25 percent or more the average worker must now pay his entire salary to taxes from january 1 to may 11 the previous administration estimated that tax receipts as a share of gnp would grow to the unprecedented level of 22 8 percent by 1984 ac cording to the house budget committee report page 31 in 1981 federal receipts are projected to exceed 21 percent for the first time since 1944 oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote the power to tax is the power to destroy the economic policies of the past several years have most certainly shackled american initiative and destroyed incentives to save work and investthe fundamentals of productivity the reagan tax plan relieves this tax burden first by keeping real taxes from increasing during the next few years and second by providing the necessary incentives to american workers and businesses to turn the economy around from a nogrowth situation to one of high growth president kennedy pointed this fact out in december of 1962 in a speech before the economic club of new york an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budgetjust as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too lowand the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now in the same way the reagan tax plan will reinvigorate the economy by restoring incentives for savings invest ment and entrepreneurship and by renewing optimism and confidence just as the kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 did enactment of tax relief in this form recommended by the president will allow the private sector to grow rapidly enough to provide new jobs without contributing to inflation and will restore the ability of the united states to compete effectively in world markets ilet us give the american people the new beginning that they voted for and still overwhelmingly support the

of the bill however well intentioned in its effort to prevent exposure of our covert agents tramples on protected first amendment freedoms for the first time in american history the publication of

it within constitutional bounds nevertheless it is my firm belief which is supported by many noted constitutional experts that no amount of tinkering can rehabilitate a law which crimianalizes constitutionally protected freedoms of speech press and political expression moreover the bill allows no exception where disclosures are aimed at revealing illegal activity oversight of our intelligence activities traditionally exercised by all the american people the press and the congress will instead be relegated solely to the two already overburdened intelligence committees recent events concerning the disturbing activities of the top echelons of the cia d6monstrate that greater accountability is necessary rather than less the best solution is to concentrate our efforts to improve the cover provided the cia and any other covert agents operating on our behalf overseas not to create criminal penalties which stem the flow of information only to our o~wn public and do little to protect our agents from hostile powers overseas i urge you to vote against this bill and i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks i firmly believe officers employees and sources that operate covertly on behalf of american foreign intelligence must be protected from harm and exposure i share the alarm of my colleagues arising from callous and irresponsible disclosure of names of covert agents however i believe that the goal of maintaining secrecy and minimizing risk of harm can be achieved by less onerous means the portion of h r 4 which i question is section 601 c this section is aimed primarily at private citizens and the press who gain knowledge of agent identities from either public or classified sources in both instances first amendment interests are compromised the intelligence committee attempted to alleviate the adverse impact on the first amendment by adopting language that narrows the intent requirement criminality hinges on a finding that the identification was made knowingly with an intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the united states and in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents and by adding a requirement that the disclosure intend to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the unitedstates by the fact of such identifileation and exposure while i applaud the committees efforts i remain convinced that no amount of tinkering can render this section constitutional as long as it seeks to criminalize publi cation of information already in the public domain these judgments all are highly subjective thereby leaving the door open for less cautious officials to level this provision at a broad class of individuals many acting within the constitution the requisite intent can be inferred whenever the publication exposes and thereby diminishes the effectiveness of an intelligence agent or activity further the intent requirement itself may have the effect of chilling legitimate critique and debate in addition it is clear that the name need not actually be revealed to constitute identifying information in some circumstances simply noting the agents title and location may be sufficient to reveal his identity thus the number of details that must be omitted and the consequent loss of credibility is also a vague expandable concept finally the concept of in the course of an effort offers no real protection as a society of professional journalists witness noted during the debate on this bill last year a journalist who is assigned to cover the intelligence community on a regular basis may indeed establish a pattern of reporting the names of agents or sources in the course of legitimate coverage of the cia furthermore even if the revelation was a single story or a single incident it is not clear that the act of investigating the story and preparing to publish it are insufficient to meet the governments concept of effort the department of justice repeatedly has emphasized that the effort need not consist of a pattern of disclosure but rather may be simply a pattern of acts with a purpose of disclosing i am not alone in this view distinguished constitutional scholars from around the country have also criticized section 601 c and its predecessors as being both unwise and unconstitutional consider this from stephen saltzberg of the university of virginia law school when it comes to punishing people who have figurcd out the identity of an agent on the basi1s of information available to the public i think there are enormous problems to overcome in fact they cannot be overcome when all is said and done i recognize that the intent element of section is it really permissible to prevent people from trying to get the government to change its ways by publicly disclosing what has been going on in order to criticize it i doubt it the line between an intention to impair the intelligence activities of the united states and an intention to seek a modification of the intelligence activities of the united states is one that is too fine for me to perceive of course the first amendment involves balancing of interests the need for the united states to protect its officers and agents is surely real and great but the first amendment is at its strongest when people are speaking out against the government criticizing what it and its agents are doing and i think the balance here will be in favor of speech section 601 c prohibits publication of identifying information even if the reporter or private individual derived the identity or identities wholly from public sources this includes disclosures based upon inferences drawn from the governments own nonclassifled documents it includes the publication of common knowledge as to who is a cia agent or source in a particular area it includes the revelation by an organizationt such as a missionary church newspaper or university based on its own internal lnve~tigation that some of its memberscontrary to the organizations policyhave acted as sources for the cia it includes republication of disclosures made by others the limit on how public this information must be before prosecution will is left to the discretion of political appointees moreover section 601 c criminalizes disclosures under a wide variety of circumstances try as the house intelligence committee did to limit the bill i still believe it will forbid both wanton and callous disclosures as well s those that serve a socially useful purpose it will create an unprecedented dilution of the notion of what constitutes freedom of speech and the press by eniminalizing the utterance of publicly available information without a showing that the national security is at stake indeed there is no requirement that any adverse impact be felt by reason of the disclosure in order to constitute a crime i am also concerned about the wide range of individuals covered by this legislation i believe this overinclusiveness adds to the constitutional problems of this bill a covert agent is defined to include not only intelligence officers or employees serving covertly outside the united states but also anyone who is a present or former agent of or a present or former informant or source of operational assistance to an intelligence agency informant is defined broadly as any individual who furnishes information to an intelligence agency in the course of a confidential relationship protecting the identity of such individual from public disclosure it is clear therefore that thousands of individuals fit this description and that the bill is primarily a source protection bill for the cia and the fbi regardless of the merits of their need for protection the breadth of the definition broadens the restraint of free speech furthermore it is not clear that protecting the identity of sources who may be in no greater peril than any other law enforcement informants weighs as heavily against the need for open discussion of american foreign affairs as does the protection of employee identities indeed the original position of the attorney general when this bills predecessor was under discussion last congress was solely to protect from harm the men and women who serve our nation as intelligence officers likewise the fbi director in seeking fbi coverage originally spoke only of employees this expanded purpose should alert us to the danger of future additions to the definition of disclosures that impair american intelligence activities congress could criminalize the disclosure of many other matters derived from public information such as the content of the covert activities themselves the methods used and so forth the fact that those activities may have been in clear violation of american law or policy would be no defense how will the line bedrawn when so much information relevant to public debate arguably could impair or impede intelligence activities or foreign relations or national defense for these reasons i believe this coverage is vastly overbroad and fundamentally at odds with a free society it is also unnecessary section 601 c simply misses the markit aims thearsenal of the criminal law at the entire populace but all the available evidence indicates that the true culprit is the combination of sloppy secrecy procedures and unauthorized disclosure of classified information in other words section 601 c of the intelligence committee bill attacks a phantom problemprivate citizens culling through public documents and sources it thereby diverts attention from the real heart of the problem which as the cia itself admitted is the disclosure of sensitive information based on privileged access by faithless government employees 0 this problem can be dealt with by punishing those employees and former employees who breach their trust by revealing identities or by providing assistance to others in identifying covert agents moreover if indeed it is possible to glean identities from public information or doeuments then it is the responsibility of the cia and the president to remove those indicators from the public domain and to improve the procedures for insuring effective cover criminalizing disclosures stemming from sloppy secrecy procedures on the other hand will only tend to lull the agency into inaction surely if private citizens have been able to infer identities from public sources so too has the kgb as the house permanent select committee on intelligence act 1coinplelled to note that provisions for the concealment of intelligence operative are not fully adequate the burden must be on the executive branch generally and the intelligence community in particular to remedy this situation accordingly the committee adopted a provision requiring the president to promulgate procedures that will help to rectify this situation i believe this course of action will be more productive and certainly less destructive of free speech inever before has a criminal sanction been attached to this kind of speech the cia insists that it is necessary but it is the responsibility of congress as well as the courts to determine whether such a measure is constitutional or whether a less onerous alternative will deal adequately with the problem in concluision i believe this bill is dangerous not only for what it forbids directly but also for the precedent it creates today we ban the disclosure of identities tomorrow there will be talk of banning disclosure of covert actions themselves why not the logic is the samethe preservation of effective foreign intelligence efforts if the american people are denied information they are denied the power that the constitution says resides with them preventing that is what the first amendment is all about ultimately it is the respect and protection we afford free speech that distinguishes this country from the nations within which the cia secretly september 93 1981 septcmber 23 1981 coi operates if a free society is sacrificed for a better intelligence system we have compromised our very goal"],

facing indeed between use of social security as a political issue in this falls campaigns and anticipation of the longawaited report of the presidents commission on social security reform it has been impossible to forget about social security for long there is certainly no doubt that the fiscal crisis which has been predicted so many times is actually upon us as you know the retirement fund has had to borrow from the disability and medicare trust funds in order to send out its november and december benefit checks on time interfund borrowing is giving us the time we need to search for a solution but it is no substitute for comprehensive reform the newspapers have also told us that many young people are losing faith in the ability of the system to pay out benefits into the longterm future i believe this demonstrates a lack of confidence not just in social security but in the ability and the willingness of congress and the administration to deal with this issue in any substantive meaningful way it is essential not only for financial reasons but also to restore public faith that congress demonstrate the political courage to deal with this difficult problem we have heard a good many suggestions in recent months as to how best to solve social securitys problems but most of the proposals have this in common they are shortterm remedial measures designed to make up the systems immediate shortfall but to do little else most ould place heavy burdens on workers or retirees or both we must protect the current and future retirees who have paid into the system for many years cuts in benefits would cause especially severe hardships for the twothirds of recipients whose social security benefits are their sole or primary source of income likewise proposals to accelerate the scheduled increases in the payroll tax would have a severe impact on the young workers of today without guaranteeing that the system would still be available when they retire i believe we should view the current situation not only as a crisis to be solved but as an opportunity for major structural reform which will secure the retirement fund well into the future the social security system was established originally to pay pensions to retired workers and their dependents and to provide for their families in case of death americans now count on social security for many different kinds of assistance but i think most would agree that its primary purpose should remain the payment of retirement and related benefits if social security is to survive its current crisis and if the american people are to continue to believe in its future the system must be retuthed to this original conception i am today introducing legislation which will not only remedy social securitys shortterm financial difficulties but will also reform the system to insure its longterm fiscal integrity the basic thrust of this legislation is to provide for a gradual transition to do the following stabilize the retirement insurance program in its current form through the payroll tax and separate out the other major components of the social security systemdisability insurance and hospital insuranceby taking them off the payroll tax and onto a permanent trust fund supported by the general fund specifically this bill maintains the oldage and survivors insurance trust fund for the payment of retirement survivors and dependents benefits oasi will still be funded by the payroll tax but will have a separate account in the federal budget disability and medicare will be consolidated into one trust fund which will draw revenues out of the general fund oasi will be credited with whatever surplus remains in the disability and hospital trust funds and the amounts already transferred under the interfund borrowing program will not need to be repaid over a transition period covering the years 198390 the oasi trust fund will receive an amount of the payroll tax decreasing from 5 275 percent in 1983 to 5 2 percent in 1984 and 5 1 percent from 1985 on even under worstcase economic assumptions this tax schedule will build up a sufficient level of reserves to insure continued payment of retirement and retirementrelated benefits through the 1980s demographic trends in the 1990s are expected to favor social security meaning that the retirement program will be stabilized well into the 21st century immediate payment of disability and medicare benefits out of the general fund would obviously place a tremendous strain on an already overloaded federal budget next years budget deficit is projected to reach 200 billion and i do not think we can sanction any measure which would add substantial amounts to that staggering figure my legislation includes several provisions which will insure that during the transition period the federal budget deficit will not be adversely affected by the addition of disability and medicare benefits first over the 198390 transition period a specified amount of the payroll tax will be paid into the consolidated disability and health insurance trust fund to be used toward the pay ment of disability and medicare benefits this amount will increase from 1 425 percent in 1983 to 1 5 percent in 1984 1 95 percent in 198586 and 2 05 percent in 198790 under this system the total payroll tax will rise from its current 6 7 to 7 05 percent in 1985 and 7 15 percent in 198790 however the payroll tax is scheduled under current law to reach 7 05 percent in 1985 7 15 percent in 1986 and 7 65 percent in 1990greater increases than those contained in this legislation second in addition the projected 10percent tax cut due to be implemented on july 1 1983 would be reduced to 5 percent with theremaining 5percent setaside during the period 198390 into the consolidated trust fund i think it is important to point out here that the payroll tax is a regressive tax because it is a flat percentage taking a proportionately greater share out of the low or middleincome workers paycheck the income tax system on the other hand is designed to be progressive the h ther ones income the greater the ta rate use of an income tax base instead of the payroll tax thus spreads the burden of disability and medicare costs more fairly while the combined revenues from the special payroll tax and the income tax setaside will result in an increase in federal outlays in some years and a surplus in others the overall effects of revenues and outlays over the transition period will more or less offset each other current figures indicate that by 1990 this proposal will actually result in a net addition to the federal budget of 1 5 billiori finally this bill includes two additional reforms which i feel are important in the effort to insure longterm stability first social security ccverage will be extended to employees of nonprofit organizations federal employees who do not already have vested pension rights in the civil service or other federal retirement system and new federal hires this approach meets two consid erations it moves the system toward the universal coverage which was intended by its founders and it protects those federal employees who have paid into their own retirement systems in good faith and are already receiving or can expect to receive returns on those contributions second costofliving adjustments will be indexed to the annual increase in wages minus 1 percentage pointsthe average annual increase in productivityrather than to the consumer price index use of the wage index will stabilize the system by subjecting its beneficiaries to the same economic conditions as its working contributors the advantages of this legislation over other proposals currently under consideration are significant it does not cut benefits to current retirees or significantly restructure the benefits to be paid to future retirees it does not accelerate payroll tax increases indeed it scales those increases back and from 1991 on the new retirement fund is projected to remain stable with a 5 1percent tax rate with regard to medicare and disability i have long felt that these programs are better suited for general revenue financing than for funding through the payroll tax these are both extremely valuable and worthwhile programs and i certainly do not intend the federal governments commitment to the ill and the disabled to be weakened in any way however it is difficult to reconcile these programs with the earned wage benefit conception on which the retirement program was founded because unlike retirement these programs do not pay benefits to everyone who pays social security taxes use of a flat percentage payroll tax on all workers is appropriate for a retirement insurance program which pays benefits to all workers but insurance against disability and illness is best funded from other sourcep it simply is not equitable to ask low and middleincome workers who may never receive benefits from these programs to bear a greater share of their costs through a regressive payroll tax the measures currently under consideration by the commission constitute bandaid approaches to the social security systems problems they may succeed in patching up the shortterm financial crisis but they cannot be presented to the american people as a comprehensive solution i believe americans are willing to sacrifice in order to help insure the systems stability but at the same time they expect and deserve a responsible and humane approach to the systems problems this proposal provides such an approach it stabilizes the retirement program for all workers without asking any one sector to bear too heavy a share of the burden of change and it transfers the components of the system which are not available to all workers to general revenue financing i urge my colleagues to use this opportunity to institute this comprehensive and muchneeded reform"], [0.9464373886585236, 0.05356261134147644, 1,

remedy the problem of unfair trade practices by countries that trade with the united states it is a very simple piece of legislation this measure very clearly requires all unitedstates agricultural trading partners to extend to the united states the same trade concessions that we extend to them in our home market if equivalent trade concessions are not provided by our trading partners then this legislation directs the president within an 18month period to impose trade restrictions on that country until those trade restrictions are lifted against imports from the united states if the president determines that any unitedstates trading partner maintains quotas or employs licensing practices with respect to unitedstates agriculture imports or subsidizes exports from their country then that countrys agricultural products will not receive column one tariff treatment from the united states until the illegal trade barriers are removed this way a tariff penalty is attached to any country that fails to observe the established rules unitedstates customs law has a twocolumn tariff schedule column 1 is for the mostfavorednation mfn countries and includes most of the gatt parties and certain others column 2 is for the nonmfn nations primarily communist countries and has a higher rate of duty than column 1 this bill will broaden column 2 to include any country which imposes illegal trade barriers in the form of quotas restrictive licensing systems or export subsidies if a country objects to this penalty it can be removed upon a change in that countrys trade practices with this high price attached to illegal trade practices it is my belief that discipline can be restored to world trade while i have been a strong advocate of free trade for many years the united

exports of raisins dates prunes dried apricots table grapes almonds and walnuts though california is the nations leading producer of highquality specialty crops this preeminence is useless if our

a very brief summary of the winn substitute in the interest of time i would like to provide for the record a more detailed discussion in general i think this is a good substitute which not only complies with the reagan budget and the reagan economic package but it maintains the technical integrity of the most promising energy technologies i rise in support of the grammlatta substitute to

substitute specifically the winn substitute for title xii in the reconciliation bill the winn substitute changes the doe authorization contained in title xii to bring the program more in line with the presidents request the winn substitute is actually below the budget requested by the reagan administration for the department of energy like the reagan request the winn substitute redirects the department of energy research and development programs into more longterm research and development activities these longterm activities will be specifically those that will not be undertaken by private industry and therefore are more appropriate as part of the government role in addition this winn substitute containts funding and continuation of the liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant the clinch river breeder reactor crbr i am deeply disturbed by the creative accounting which was done by our committee in this reconciliation process the baseline which was chosen resulted in the committee on science and technology appearing to have come 1 8 billion under their as signed levels when in fact the committee was almost 100 million over the budget levels recommended by the reagan administration for all of the agencies which the science committee authorizes these false savings make a mockery of our hard work in trying to bring this federal budget back into line second i oppose title xii in the budget reconciliation package because of the fact that the strategic petroleum reserve is authorized at 3 8 billion this level of authorization is directly contrary to the assumptions made when the first concurrent budget resolution was passed at that time the decision was made to finance the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget both mr dingell and mr broyhill have proposed alternative ways of funding the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget and that issue should be resolved during the discussion on title vi even without the strategic petroleum reserve we feel that the winn substitute is preferable to the doe authorizations contained in title xii the winn substitute shifts funding into the solar and conservation r d programs at doe also a second geothermal demonstration plant for that promising resource is provided therefore providing a more balanced energy research and development budget than originally recommended by the administration the major difference between the two versions is that the jones substitute will provide for the termination of the clinch river breeder reactor project the decision to terminate the clinch river breeder reactor was make in committee by an effective twovote margin by contrast in the past the house has always opposed amendments to terminate crbr by margins of over 80 votes each time the crbr is essential to maintaining our countrys nuclear generating option in the next century without it we are left to rely on other more speculative generating options to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry in the next century we would also be departing from the energy path that the rest of the industrialized world is following for their future i want to reiterate that the administration strongly

audit followup and other basic ingredients of sound financial management and good government the bill has active support among accountants auditors professional as sociations and the general

to devise and schedule plans to strengthen any weaknesses h r 1526 would require the estab lishment of internal accounting and administrative controls at each executive agency in accordance with standards prescribed by the comptroller general these controls would provide assurances that all obligations and costs are in compliance with the law that all funds property and other assets are protected against waste and mismanagement and that all transactions are properly recorded standards would also be prescribed by the comptroller general to insure the prompt resolution of all audit findings once the standards have been prescribed by the comptroller general the office of management and budget would be required to establish guidelines for the evaluation by agencies of their

of jews to freedom from nazioccupied hungary late in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his soul to rest in peace regardless of his fate i am both proud and honored to join with my colleagues in asking the congress of the united states to bestow honorary

i want to commend the conferees on their hard work on thiscrucisl matter we all realize that a social security conference is never easy ai~d the serious nature of the financial difficulties facing our social security system made this conference report very important prom the beginning i have protested the administrations plan to eliminate the minimum benefit i am pleased that the conference committee agreed to reverse repeal of the minimum benefit for current recipients this action is a positive first step the conference report before us authorizes interfund borrowing among all three social security trust funds until december 31 1982 this provision addresses the immediate shortterm financial priblemis of the social security system but it is iot a remedy for the longrange ills of the system the need remains clear and strong for more substantive action in this regard i have been doing a lot of research and studying anid talking to my constituents in northwest iowa about how we can save social security in the long term through forums conducted in june throughout the sixth district through public meetings i held in august and through many valuable letters i have received helpful suggestions from my constituents on how we can preserve our social security system in a fair and evenhanded manner as a result just a few weeks ago i introduced three bills which would save the system without hurting present and future retirees my package of bills would include the following provisions first would preclude payment of all social security benefits to convicted criminals second would increase the costofliving adjustments by either the rise in the cpi or the wage index whichever is lower and third would redirect the system back toward its original purpose by financing hospital insurance from general revenues experts tell us that the retirement and survivors fund will come up short by an estimated 80 9 billion in the next 5 years and that the system will need 110 6 billion in the years 198790 thus as best we can tell social security will need about 191 5 billion more in 198190 in order to continue paying benefits my social security package is projected to save social security at least 213 billion i say at least because i am referring only to my bills which address the costofliving adjustments and the funding of hospital insurance additional savings would result from the elimination of social security benefits to prisonersabout 17 million in i believe that my proposals address both the short and longterm problems of the social security system it is not a bandaid plan that will fix the system tempo1tarily rather these bills if adopted will assure finaircial stability at least through the next decade it is my feeling that once and for all we must solve the financial problems of our social security system in the past we have not been accurate in estimating the financial needs of the system and we have time and time again relied on raising taxes i believe that we do not have to resort to raising taxes or significantly cutting benefits by accepting a plan that will clearly restore the integrity to the system and build confidence in social security by accepting the conference report on h r 4331 we are taking the first step a positive step in the right direction the restoration of the minimum benefit for current retirees will finally put an end to the uncertainty that so many retirees had to face during the past months from the beginning i felt that we should not have inflicted such uncertainty and fear upon our elderly by inactioni

prevailing wage as that prevailing wage is determined by the government a few years ago in our hearings we had the president of the national association of manufacturers before us certainly not a prounion or proworker or prolabor organization and i asked him directly whether he had any problems with the philosophy of when the taxpayers money is being used that the workers get a prevailing wage and he had no problem with the philosophy what we are dealing with here is not how it is implemented what we are dealing with here is basic national policy and the philosophy that this government will use and who are the taxpayers by the way the taxpayers are the working people who pay the money for these construction projects as well as the construction people themselves for some reason or another

going to be no difference in the equipment cost there is going to be no difference in the material cost there is certainly going to be no reduction in the contractors profit and it is interesting that we have no provision if we want to save the taxpayers money by putting a limitation on the profit a contractor can make in this area so the only place he can get it is out of wages and if he can find workers who will work 10 percent or more below what the prevailing wage is then by this amendment he must because the amendment says shall he must be given that contract if he is an employer who wants to pay the prevailing wage to his workers then by law the government is saying that you cannot have the contract i think this is everybodys money involved and i think we have to be fair with everyone

strike the last word as the chairman mentioned the need for this amendment plus a companion amendment to title iii of the bill is a result of a schedule slip in the space shuttle program in 1978 the congress directed the navy to lease future communications satellite service rather than continuing to build its own fleet satellite communications fijtsatcom system which was about to enter service in response to that direction the navy awarded a competitively negotiated contract to obtain satellite communication service to the fleet on a lease basis as a followon to the fltsatcom program under the terms of that contract the contractor is responsible for construction and launch of satellites that would satisfy navy requirements after successful launch and deployment the navy would then purchase the communication services provided by the satellites on entering into the leased satellite or leasat contract it was understood that the space shuttle would be available as a launch vehicle in early 1982 and the contractor designed leasat for shuttle launch only based on the shuttle schedule that was in existence in 1978 since that time the shuttle has incurred an extensive delay and the first leasat launch is now scheduled for may 1984vice april 1982 as originally planned this has caused a significant change in the contractor financing arrangement the contractor has stopped production efforts on the leasat and has placed the program in a caretaker status lengthy discussions and negotiations between the secretary of the navy and the contractor have led to a tentative agreement for modification to the existing contract to implement revised terms if a mutually agreed shuttle schedule and service requirements for satellite communications can be reached by november 1 1981 contract modifications being considered include a redistribution of payments to accommodate financing requirements but with no increase in total program cost additionally the navy will be given attractive lease buy options for service beyond the original 5year period and flexibility in launch dates to execute the terms of the contract modification the navy requires 87 million by november 1 1981 for the contract modification to be implemented this is 59 million above the amount already included in the fiscal year 1982 budget request for operations and maintenance funds for the leasat program the current fiscal year 1982 budget request for 8 million reflects the funds originally considered to be required under the existing contract in order to effect these payments an additional 59 million must be authorized forfiscal year 1982 in the operations and maintenance account title iii of our bill the committee will propose a companion amendment to title iii to take care of the leasat funding shortfall when title iii is opened to amendment this amendment will not increase the amount authorized for navy operations and maintenance as a result of this significant slip in the leasat program the navy is we riously concerned about future availability of satellite communication service and the potential adverse impact on military operations it this service is not available over the years the navy has become increasingly dependent on communications satellites as has the entire department of defense landbased communication facilities have been drawn down in order to decrease the cost of operations reduce american military presence overseas and to improve worldwide defense related command control and communications this reliance on communication satellites goes to the very heart of the need to preserve a robust fleet satellite communication system a system that currently serves both tactical and strategic users this navy concern is shared by the unified and specified commanders the joint chiefs of staff and the air force even though the initial successful test of the space shuttle has increased hopes that the leased satellite system leasat will ultimately be put in service the administration believes that the fleet satellite or fltsat system must be continued as an insurance policy for a variety of reasons including strategic force requirements the military services current satellite communication capability is based on the five fleet satellites that were authorized prior to the direction to lease satellite communication service although the fleet satellite program was based on a satellite design life of less than 4 years the navy hopes it can obtain as much as 6 years of service from these same satellites this optimism is based on the excellent service and technical characteristics displayed by the four fleet satellites that are currently on orbit even with this potential longer life and without the always possible catastrophic satellite failure or the possible launch failure of the fifth fleet satellite in august of this year the navy would need to launch an additional satellite not later than may of 1985 to continue a viable military commnunications system worldwide if leasat service were not available because of space shuttle related or other difficult es to support such a launch date the only reasonable course would be the continuation of the proven vltsatcom program satellites to protect this option long lead materials need to be ordered in fiscal year 1982 in this context the procurement of three additional satellites would protect the militarily essential foursatellite constellation which provides for defensewide tactical requirements and sf1 ategic coverage long lead material for these satellites in the amount of 65 million would have to be placed on contract in early fiscal ye ar 1982 to execute this plan the need for such an insurance policy would of course become more pressing if the launch of the fifth fltsatcom satellite which is already procured and now scheduled for launch in august of this year were to be unsuccessful i believe it is important to continue the fleet satellite program i therefore request support for this amendment that provides the 65 million that is required to procure the long lead materials needed to protect the option to launch additional fleet satellites beginning in 1985

proposed 3year extension of the ban on credit card surcharges contained in h r 31 and s on february 24 1981 this body passed h r 31 by the overwhelming margin of 372 to 4 the banking committee had forwarded the measure after a very brief debate on a proposed amendment to permit both cash discounts and surcharges that amendment which i supported was defeated in committee a few days later h r 31 swept through the house primarily because of the great esteem in which every member of this body holds its principal author the distinguished gentleman from illinois mr annunzio indeed it was only because of my great respect and affection for him that i did not speak against this bill at that time however as others have now raised the issue and heightened controversy i feel compelled to speak out as you may recall the discussion on the house floor at that time focused primarily upon the need to permit unlimited cash discounts what little discussion there was of the surcharge issue led one to believe that the prohibition against credit card surcharges was necessary to protect consumers and was consequently in the public interest on march 12 1981 the full senate considered similar legislation to permit unlimited cash discounts and impose an additional 3 year ban on credit card surcharges senator paoxmire and senator glenn immediately proposed an amendment to the garnchafee bill which would have permitted merchants to choose between cash discounts or credit card surcharges that amendment precipitated a 3 hour debate on the senate floor the amendment was eventually defeated by a vote of 41 to 56 since that time i have had an opportunity to study that extended debate i rise today because i have become increasingly concerned that we in the house of representatives may have acted without a complete understanding of the economic consequences reresulting from yet another extension of the ban on credit card surcharges the senate debate revealed opposition to the surcharge ban from the broadest imaginable spectrum of groups and agencies both the consumer federation of america and consumers union oppose the ban on surcharges cfa wrote that it was totally and unequivocally opposed to the surcharge ban contained hi s 414 they stated that this government intrusion on the free market gives consumers incorrect signals about creditmaking it appear to be free when it in fact has substantial costs further the surcharge ban penalizes lowerincome purchasers who cannot qualify for credit cards they still pay for the merchant discount in their prices finally the ban discourgages merchants from offering legal cash discounts whose only difference from credit surcharges is a semantic one to those who argue that lifting the surcharge ban can cause abuse we respond that the lifting of the ban is not likely to cause any merchant to deceive consumers who are not already doing so the potential for deception is much greater in the cash discount situation especially where the merchant raises his regular prices one day to a phony regular price and then the next day offers a cash discount which brings the price of the goods back to their actual regular price certainly the proponents of the ban would not argue that cash discounts should be eliminated because there is this potential for abuse cfa favors limit of 7 percent on the amount of the surcharge and the cash discount however if the choice is between the surcharge ban and the removal of the ban with no limitation we support your amendment to remove this ban without limitation the ban constitutes an unwarranted government intrusion into the marketplace that serves only one special interest groupcredit card issuersat the expense of other consumers your amendment to allow unlimited surcharges would remove this special interest provision and permit more equitable pricing of goods and services the international ladies garment workers union wrote thatthe government ban on credit surcharges forces retailers to charge all custcmers for the merchant discounts paid to credit card companies last year these charges amounted to over 1 5 billion for american express visa and mastercharge alone simply put the ban requires cash customers to subsidize credit card purchases even lowerincome consumers who cannot qualify for credit cards pay this cost of credit the ban also deceives consumers about the true cost of credit burying the merchant discount in the overall price of goods additionally the aflcio opposes the surcharge ban opposition to the surcharge ban was also expressed by the national small business association the national farmers union the national council of senior citizens and the national taxpayers union the council for a competitive economy opposed the surcharge ban with the following language i am writing to express the councils vigorous opposition to the creditsurcharge ban in s 414 the cash discount act the council as you know is a national business organization dedicated to the free competitive economy unhampered by regulation subsi dy or special privilege we have members in all 50 states including utah our support of free competition leads us to oppose the surcharge ban an anticompetitive regulation that interferes with business people and consumers and that is out of step with the economic views expressed by the voters in november in a free economy merchants have the right to use surcharges for any purpose this is simply voluntary exchange customers are free to shop elsewhere if they dislike the extra charge this view is implicity conceded in s 414 which allows unlimited discounts for cash customers the surcharge ban then is perplexing if merchants are free to use one device they should be free to use the other i

oregon border form one of the most magnificent coastlines in the entire world and serve the uinited states as an esthetic and recreational resource secretary watt has proposed that these basins be reconsidered for leasing however there are very compelling reasons why this is not an appropriate course of action the resource estimates for the north ern four basins would provide a mere 11 days of oil and gas at current rates of consumption the santa m1aria basin which is the fifth basin in lease sale 53 harbors 80 percent of the resources of the lease sale the state of california and the california delegation did not object to leasing in the lower 81 tracts of the santa maria basin where the resource estimates were high and the environmental and economic risks were lower clearly the objection is not to increased offshore production of energy but to the criteria used to judge which areas are suitable for exploration it makes go od economic and energy sense to target resources where the resourcp estimates and the yield potentials are the highest it is also important to remember that offshore drilling is one of the most energy intensive forms of energy production this further underscores the need to target areas where a high degree of success is likely the northern four basins of lease sale 53 do not fit any of these criteria and for these reasons have been opposed

leasing of the northern four basins is inconsistent with the secretarys selfproclaimed good neighbor policy just 2 days ago secretary watt again reiterated that the president believes the state local

as the final arbiter but as a partner with state local and county govern ments in helping solve the problems facing the people the slippage between the announced policy and the reality of the secretarys actions was addressed by my distinguished friend from oregon ls aucoin who offered this provision as an amendment in the interior appropriations subcommittee and worked so diligently to see

step toward asserting congressional prerogatives visavis the executive branch the intent of congrcss is very clear in the ocs lands act amendments which require a balance between risks to the environment and projected gains from energy production congressional intent is equally explicit with respect to the provision requiring that the department of the interiors actions be consistent with californias federally approved coastal plan thus the appropriations committee has acted wisely and prudently in insuring that this treasured coastline will not fall victim to an encroachment on congressional intent which can devastate the economy and environment of hundreds of coastal communities"]]}
