more disturbing that the russians are actively trying to suopress and harass soviet citizens who try to secure their rights as guaranteed bsr international agreement yesterday the world learned that soviet authorities have brought charges of high treason against anatoly scharansky who applied in 1973 for an emigration visa to join his family in israel and was refused and subsequently arrested in march of this year the soviet authorities maintain that mr scharansky was working for the cia i will admit that our cia does not have a spotless record in world affairs but that really does not diminish the absurdity of the charges it would be ludicrous if it were not for the fact that mr scharansky has the death penalty hanging over his head the state department has characterized these charges as misinformation laced with slander and innuendo the question arises why have the soviets gone to so much trouble to bring this soviet jews activities to a halt why do they employ the big lie a historical precedent for the suppression of human rightsin doing so the answer may be that mr scharansky is a founding member of the public group to promote the observance of the helsinki agreements

states the group hopes that its information will be taken into account at all official meetings which are provided for in the final act under the point further steps after helsinki evidently the russians are afraid the truth about their lack of compliance will get out of russia they have great reason to be concerned now and they are willing to go to great lengths to suppress the activities of groups such as mr scharanskys because of the upcoming conference in belgrade of the helsinki signatory nations this conference will examine the status of the final act scrutinizing the compliance of all the signatory nations it is obviously the soviet desire to minimize to the greatest possible extent charges of their abuses of human rights as guaranteed in the helsinki agreement it is ironic that had the russians lived up to their obligations in the final act by allowing scharansky to emigrate and join his family outside russia they would not have had this spy courageously attempting to

states local communities and nonprofit organizations to develop inexpensive and easytouse mechanisms for settling minor disputes and will accomplish it in a manner which will be fair to both parties the need for this legislation arises from the fact that our overburdened courts and traditional complex legal procedures frequently do not provide an opportunity for a satisfactory settlement of miner disputes while these disputes may involve only small amounts of money or disagreement over relatively insignificant matters yet they can be very important to the parties who are engaged in them the bill will be administered by the department of justice which already has a staff experienced in these matters the objective of the department will be to encourage both the improvement of worthwhile

gentleman from new jersey this is an amendment that would strike a proportion of section 3 i think it is clearly in order the bill before us in section 3 provides what is called equal access to the employees of a proposed bargaining unit prior to the representation election at the present time we have 42 years of precedents built up through board decisions and court decisions that have established a fine balance of the rights of employees employers and the labor organization which is seeking the right to represent the employees the bill before us in the section that i am seeking to strike would change these ground rules in the name of equal access at the present time as an illustration an employer is prohibited from going into the home of an employee to talk about the issues of a pending representation election the employer is prohibited from making certain statements or promises whether it be in the plant whether it be verbally or by written communication the careful balance of election campaign rights would be completely upset by this socalled equal access provision what this bill provides is that if the employer takes advantage of an opportunity of speaking to his employees at the plant during working hours then the union will have the same right to come into the plant and speak to the employees during working hours on the property of the employer probably at the expense of the employer that has a superficial aura of fairness about it but think how contrary this is to the other provisions of the bill as i pointed out in general debate yesterday we have a 15day election provision that means that from the time the union files the petition or as amended by the committee from the time the emnloyer is served with notice of the petition until the election is actually held no more than 15 days may elapse as a matter of fact as i pointed out in colloquy with the gentleman from new tersey the 15day period is a maximum length of time not a minimum length of time so the election may be held within 5 days or within 2 days or within 10 days of notification being served upon the employer let us take the example of a small businessman who is unsophisticated in the ways of the national labor relations law he is probably living tens or hundreds of miles from the nearest lawyer who specializes in the national labor relations act this unsophisticated employer steps into the shop and says to his employees fellows whats wrong i didnt know that we had any problem if you want higher wages lets talk about it but i dont understand why you filed this petition for an election that action would trigger this equal access section and there might be only 2 days or perhaps 10 days or 5 days left between that time and the election in that event how in the world are we going to have the union go before the board and have a determination made they are entitled to have equal access and have the board enter an order establishing the time and the circumstances under which the union can come into the plant and make its presentation to those same employees i think therefore the equal access provision is totally unworkable especially in the light of the time limits and the other restrictions imposed by the committee and i think it is neither fair nor equitable to give the union the opportunity to come on the property of the employer to make a presentation to the employees during business or working hours it is not even clear in this provision whether that can be done during working hours but i think it can be if that happens the employer will be paying employees for nonproductive time while the union is engaged in lobbying if you will or electioneering prior to the representation election i would exhort the members to keep the law as it is today and uphold the 42 years of precedents let us not upset the law with this equal access provision i hope the members will support my amendment to strike this provision"],

the growing stress we are placing on our fixed water supply we need the water more americans are demanding more water for more uses and i can see a day when priority calls on freshwater will uncontrollably multiply if we do not develop more effective water resource management and this begins with a rational program for adding to our water storage and flood control base most of the dams reservoirs and water distribution systems we now have were planned with much smaller populations in mind during the thirties and forties we are overstretching our available water supply we do not have enough firm longterm carryover capacity especially in areas of the country vulnerable to recurring droughts california is importing water oklahoma is rationing water water districts in oregon are considering rationing communities in south dakota are already hauling water in much of the great plains ground moisture is 30 to 40 percent of normal and thousands of wells are going dry it is projected that in much of the midwest and west up to 60 percent of the small farms will require 5 years to recover from the effects of protracted drought and that 5 percent will never recover the area

enough water to do business major droughtrelated fires in new mexico have burned away over 45 000 acres of timber and grass worth 15 million i could go on and on this body has gotten quite used to the litany of woe about the lack of water in the west and elsewhere but there just is not enough water to go around if we do nothing more about planning for water scarcity there will be more legitimate claims for water than water left to satisfy those claims we will end up competing for water in the courts if we do nothing more about planning for water scarcity freshwater will follow the same depletion curve as the domestic production of crude oil and natural gas water is a finite resource renewable yes but not inexhaustible we have got to control what comes to us to waste this resource by not collecting and allocating it rationally will put catastrophic constraints on our capacity to match food energy and other waterdependent supplies with the growth we are already undergoing dr helmut landsberg acting director of the institute for fluid dyamics and applied mathematics at the university of maryland and one of the worlds foremost climatologists tells me that periodic droughts in the united states are not uncommon and they are very likely to repeat we seem to have severe droughts in the united states every 20 years or so geared to the solar cycle he says and as our population grows and our need for water grows the impacts of future droughts on our water supply will be much much greater unless we develop carefully planned water resource strategies now much of the country the west especially will dissipate its freshwater base the west is growing rapidly population growth in the much drier west is already impinging seriously on complex and fragile wateruse interdependencies the census bureau reports that population in 13 western states between 1970 and 1976 grew by 10 7 percent or 32 8 percent of the total unitedstates population growth over this period much of this growth is occurring in western cities with populations over 50 000 representing 33 9 percent of total unitedstates metropolitan growth between 1970 and 1974 accelerating western municipal and industrial water use is beginning to crowd out traditional and prior agricultural rights and state to state diversions of scarcer water to meet the most desperate needs are straining mutual rights agreements under multistate compacts with population growth in the west we will need much more water to provide energy as oil and natural gas fuels are phased out new federal energy source options will use much more water in such production processes as getting oil from shale or the liquefaction of coal new electrical generating plants will use enormous amounts of water for cooling and this is water never returned to the supply system the water resources council estimates that each new nuclear plant will use 235 gallons of water to produce a million btus of electrical energy by contrast conventional fossil fuel plants use 120 gallons to produce the same amount of energy and if the presidents coal policy is implemented the west would become one of the principal suppliers of the low sulfur coal needed to comply with national ambient air quality standards the presidents proposal to increase coal production from 665 million tons per year in 1976 to 1 225 million tons per year by 1985 would impact badly on the west where new strip mining industries would become major water use competitors according to andy mccue in energy user news the price of water will easily be a factor in the cost of western coal production if the presidents choice of using coal slurry pipelines to carry crushed coal to powerplants is implemented instead of using our existing railroads to do this job many western states will lose substantial supplies of nonrenewable water on one hand the administration plans to make major new demands on our diminishing fresh water base and on the other hand chooses to forfeit the means to provide the additional water we will absolutely require i respectfully question a presidential policy that would modify the bonneville central project for example by cutting back a carefully planned 313 000acrefoot supply to 36 000 acrefeet depriving irrigators and urban areas in the bonneville basin of badly needed water and at the same time wipe out 133 000 kilowatthours of lowcost hydroelectric generation it makes little sense to me that the administration chooses to eliminate entirely the hillsdale lake project in kansas this project is already 30 percent complete it was authorized in 1954 based on carefully projected water supply and flood control requirements of the general kansas city area especially when the purchase of water for kansas citys municipal supply from hillsdale lake was already contracted for each project the committee recommends is an authorized project the congress has already considered each one of them on their merits and made its decision based on numerous reports and extensive hearingsdays and days of hearings these projects were studied again and again in the authorizing process and in the appropriating process bringing a water project on line from the planning stage to authorization to funding is a very lengthy process these projects did not loom up suddenly overnight each one of the committees recommendations brings to this floor careful thought given to current water needs and future water needs these projects will not solve todays water supply problems in a sense they are stopgaps for the future they can only help until we build an integrated water distribution system that includes storage along with carefully considered distribution allocations i am convinced that we can safely and efficiently increase our water supply in the pacific northwest the army corps of engineers estimates that an additional 18 million acre feet of storage can be provided meeting strict environmental and costbenefit criteria this would provide enough water storage for the pacific northwest to meet all its competing water needs through 2020 i would be the first to agree that we must exercise great caution in selecting sites for water projects and that we make very sure that each site considered meets the most stringent environmental and costbenefit standards and i agree that the congress ought soon to consider rules to make sure that future projects are screened this way i do not agree that all of the projects singled out by the president for modification or elimination comprise a sound budgetary or water resource policy and i find it especially ironic that the president insists on carrying out what amounts to a policy of future domestic water supply curtailment while financing a number of foreign water projects through unitedstates participation in the world bank and the international development associations loan program we are currently financing up to a billion dollars in hydroelectric projects around the world fifteen nations are benefiting from this funding and i have to ask what kinds of costbenefit analysis did these projects get and did the costbenefit guidelines change for these projects in midstream to accommodate them the president approves unitedstates funding for such projects as rumanias 50 million hydroelectric plant yet he seeks to eliminate entirely
