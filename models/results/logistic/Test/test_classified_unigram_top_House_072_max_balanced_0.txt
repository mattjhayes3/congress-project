democrats of the ways and means committee and myself in mr crisps office that the better policy would be to prepare a nonpartisan tax bill and present it to the house of representatives in view of the fact that the democratic majority is small we felt it would be difficult if not impossible to pass in the house of representatives a partisan bill in addition to that in the hearts of these nen and in their conversations they thought it was the more patriotic thing to take into our confidence the entire membership of the house in undertaking to pass this important piece of legislation the only two thoughts conveyed to the country in the statement from the ways and means committee was that it was to be a nonpartisan bill and that there were to be sufficient taxes raised to balance the budget i mention the background to this and my democratic friends especially to meet some criticisms that have been directed at me for advocating the policy of levying sufficient taxes to sustain the credit of the governmeiat in view of that background i think i had a right to ask the house of representatives and especially the democrats to join with us in an effort to levy sufficient taxes to take care of the obligations made by the congress of the united states the committee on ways and means went about their work in executive session and reported a bill to the house of representatives in the course of those executive sessions i was told and i think the membership of the house was told that the committee believed it impossible to find sufficient taxes which they thought the house would indorse in order to balance the budget unless they went to a manufacturers tax my reply to that was that i had been opposed to a sales tax ever since i had been a member of congress and i had always been and always would be opposed to a sales tax i am now opposed to a sales tax but gentlemen if i find it impossible to balance this budget and restore the confidence of the world and our own people in our government without some such tax i would levy any tax sales or any other kind in order to do that i think more of my country than i do of any theory of taxation that i may have and the country at this time is in a condition where the worst taxes you could possibly levy would be better than no taxes at all the committee of the whole house acted otherwise i have no quarrel with you i have said on the floor of this house scores and scores of times and i repeat it now that i do not believe in rules being applied to the house of representatives that take away from it the freedom of expression not only of your voice but of your vote i believe in freedom of expression therefore i was unwilling to have any gag rule so called applied to the consideration of this bill i wanted the members to have free opportunity to express themselves in the committee of the whole and you have had that opportunity you have expressed yourselves you have arrived at a conclusion that you will not have a sales tax and i repeat i have no quarrel with you because of it i appeal to you not only in the name of my party but my country that in view of the fact there has been stricken from this bill more than 500 000 000 of taxation it is your duty your paramount duty to help this house and this committee restore some taxes to this bill in order that this countrys financial integrity may be maintained my only object in taking the floor was to make that one appeal last saturday as well as yesterday the people of the world realized that congress in a gesture had indicated that it did not intend to balance this budget what was the result not only among american people but among the peoples of the world as reflected through the new york stock exchange and other exchanges in this country what did we find we found the foreigner selling the dollar we found our exchange going down more than it has at any time in the past 12 years we found it renewed yesterday and we found that followed by a sharp reduction in united states securities what does that mean it simply means that the 1 800 000 000 of money belonging to foreigners who have come to us with the idea that this flag not only protected the person but protected property and who put their credits in the banks of our country because they thought that was the safest place on the face of the earth to deposit their wealth have transferred their gold to foreign vaults when they heard around the world that there was some doubt about this congress balancing the budget they immediately began to withdraw their wealth to sell american exchange and transfer their gold to foreign vaults as sure as i stand in the well of this house i believe that if this congress today should decline to levy a tax bill there would not be a bank in existence in the united states in 60 days that could meet its depositors i believe that the shock to the nation the shock to the foreigner who is doing business with us would be such that there would be a financial panic such as has never been equaled in this republic since its organization this committee will bring in a program i hope you will support it i do not want all the taxes that are in there you can not get just the taxes that you want this committee is composed of 24 men from 24 different states i believe you will admit they are fairly intelligent they are patriotic they want to serve the country they want to serve you they would like to bring in an ideal bill that could be voted for by every member of this house but it is impossible to do it so i appeal to you that if you do not like the taxes which they report will you not be good enough will you not have statesmanship enough when you criticize it and ask to strike it out will you not have the manhood to substitute something in its place at the risk of being criticized i want to give to the world and to the country today if i can an expression of this house so that the world and the country may realize we are going to balance the budget may i do an unusual thing i may be criticized for it but i want every man and every woman in this house who hopes to balance the budget and who is willing to go along with that effort to try to balance the budget to rise in their seats now if they do not mind those who do not want to balance the budget can rise in their seats i think this ought to restore to the american people confidence in our country we may have differences among ourselves but in our hearts we are patriotic we want to serve this republic this is a sensible congress and we can get sensible results i again want to ask the charity of the house and i am going to say to the membership that with their permission for the balance of the consideration of this bill i hope to participate in it i said to the gentlemen of the ways and means committee yesterday that i would not consider it any reflection on me or on my honor or integrity or desire to serve the nation if the committee disagreed with me about some of the taxes that is a privilege it is not only a privilege but it is the duty of the members to express themselves i am an organization democrat i never in my life cast a vote against my own judgment except i had to go along with the democratic organization i have done that and i will do it again you must have organization we have it through committees and it is the only way we can function in this house let me say to the republican side that during the consideration of this bill while some remarks have been made by men in high authority on the outside that ought not to have been made the membership in this house on the republican side has been quite decent i am willing to pay them that encomium because they are entitled to it gentlemen i just wanted to say these few words to you let me say to the democrats alone do not become critical do not throw brickbats let us be brotherly so far as we can if one of us should disagree do not point your finger at him and

compulsory removals from the active list will still be necessary and these removals in order to produce the desired effect must be confined largely to the officers appointed on or before july 1 1920 i e to the prewar and world war groups the proper method for obtaining the number of compulsory terminations of active service that are necessary after the resources of retirement for age and physical

to bring about the total attrition that is required provided such a board is allowed due latitude in the discharge of its task the result so obtained can be expected to be in the best interest of the

corporation and to decrease the number of idle in this country by creating employment through the authorization and expedition of a publicworks program and to provide a method of financing such a program the bill divides itself into three parts title i provides for authorizing the appropriation of the sum of 100 000 000 to be available to the president of the united states until july 1 1933 to be disbursed by him either in the form of loans of money or of supplies or in the form of gifts title ii expands the facilities of the reconstruction finance corporation it now lends to banks mortgage companies surety companies and other bona fide finance companies under this bill it is authorized to make loans to persons or corporationseither public corporations quasipublic corporations or private corporations for this purpose the reconstruction finance corporation is given increased authority to issue bonds and debentures from three times the amount of its subscribed stock which is 500 000 000 to five times that amount so that whereas the reconstruction finance corporation was heretofore enabled to issue 1 500 000 000 in debentures it now has the right to issue 2 500 000 000 in debentures or an increase of 1 000 000 000 title iii is a comprehensive publicworksconstruction program providing for the prosecution of river and harbor improvements as recommended by the war department the building of roads the prosecution of existing projects of flood control on the mississippi river the sacramento river and other streams the erection of postoffice and various other public buildings it is hoped that by the carrying out of this publicworksconstruction program thousands upon thousands of idle hands will become busy purchasing power will increase consumption demand will increase and to a great extent the wheels of industry ought to again revolve relative to title i providing for the sum of 100 000 000 at the disposal of the president i would say that this is a bill of rescue and mercy we have not as yet plumbed the depths of misery and suffering brought on by unemployment if we can not give the poor but ablebodied men jobs we must at least give them food and clothing to the opponents of this bill i would say these poor and needy ones ask for bread and you on the republican side of the aisle would give them a stone under ordinary conditions i would not wish to place such tremendous power in the hands of the president during the world war we gave our president huge powers we are now engaged in wara war against need and suffering powers commensurate with the responsibilities brought on by this economic war must again be granted to the president private charity is unavailing the coffers of private organizations are empty all private means have become exhausted the emergency unemployment relief committee namely in new york is near the end of its rope even the socalled rich in new york city are unable to help they can not give further there is plenty of precedent for us to approve this measure we gave many millions to the starving russians germans and austrians some weeks ago we donated 40 000 000 bushels of wheat to the needy of this land through the american red cross this morning i am informed that the committee on agriculture has voted out another bill for an additional 40 000 000 bushels of wheat and 500 000 bales of cotton to clothe and feed unfortunate people through the instrumentality of the american red cross it is not only a question of getting jobs for the poor from 10 to 20 per cent of our population are outside of such help and can not be relieved by jobs they can not work there are the great masses of aged and decrepit people helpless women and children and in short the halt the lame and the feeble the only benefit to them of jobs is the small amount of relief that trickles down to them from those near and dear to them who are possessed of jobs but getting jobs is not enough they need direct relief and must have it unless we help those in need of charity i shudder to consider the dreadful consequences starvation and ruin visited upon thousands there would be uprisings and upheavals the repercussions of which would be felt for decades to come we can not remain indifferent in the face of such impending calamity title ii of the act really puts the reconstruction finance corporation into the banking business it provides that private individuals and private corporations may receive loans upon good security as are now available to banks railroads and so forth while banks are no longer failing in the same proportion as last year and while we might say that bank failures have been practically arrested nevertheless many people in this land still lack proper confidence in our banking system they are still hoarding their money instead of putting it into these banks there is ever present in the minds of the bankers the fear of sudden runs and sudden demands for the withdrawal of deposits this makes bankers timid they must remain liquid as a consequence they do not lend their money many bankers state that there is little or no demand for money on the part of good and solvent concerns since the banks can not will not or dare not make loans some other instrumentality must be set up to make loans to private enterprises this the bill permits the reconstruction finance corporation to do at first i viewed with fear and trepidation the encroachment of the reconstruction finance corporation in the field of the banks but i have spoken to several bankers of prominence in new york and am informed that they see no harm in the reconstruction finance corporation entering the banking field as a temporary measure this is a temporary measure the war finance corporation during the world war made loans directly to private business it suffered no losses and did great good in this emergency the reconstruction finance corporation may duplicate the splendid work performed by the war finance corporation during the war the huge sums of money now piled up in the banks are sterile useless nonproductive and offer no credit base last week the surplus bank reserves in new york city on the part of the larger banks amounted to 150 000 000 that means 150 000 000 over legal surplus requirements that surplus bank reserve has no useful purpose in fact it is dangerous it is proof positive that the member banks are not loaning any money are not extending additional commercial credit in a certain sense banking credit is not responding to the needs of trade no credit means no business no construction no initiative no enterprise with business stagnant no work no jobs private banking being unwilling or unable to supply the needed credit to industry public banking must therefore we empower the reconstruction finance corporation to enter the field of private banking and do temporarily at least what the private bankers can not or will not do title iii really embodies hoover

jobs president hoover has advocated again and again publicworks construction he has promised and promised the democrats now perform mealymouthed republicans have used words and words and more words
