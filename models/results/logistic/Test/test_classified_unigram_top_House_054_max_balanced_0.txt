in the membranes of the brain applicant was married to soldier february 22 1866 and has remained a widow since his death her claim for pension under general law on the ground that the disease of brain of which soldier died is not accepted as a result of pensioned causes her claim under act of june 27 1890 was rejected on the ground of nondependence dr t b wright who attended soldier during his final sickness from september 23 to november 11 1894 testified that soldier suffered with violent headache for many days in the beginning of his sickness with slight fever that he had several recurrent attacks of paralysis with coma and stertorous breathing at times he had a low delirium the pupil of one eye was dilated during entire sickness he suffered from an attack of herpes zoster during the last weeks of his sickness he died in a profoundly comatose condition which had lasted several days before his death the postmortem examination showed an extensive blood clot within the membranes of the brain of such character as to indicate refected hemorrhages during the time he had been sick the cause of such hemorrhages was probably a weakened state of the blood vessels due to longcontinued low vitality of the patient dr h c allen of circleville ohio testified march 10 1896 i was called in consultation in the case of the late capt burr h bostwick and was also present at the postmortem examination he died from hemorrhage or blood clot on the brain and i am inclined to think that from the symptoms he had several hemorrhages the hemorrhages i think were caused from atheromatous degeneration of the arteries and in my opinion the wound from which he suffered by reducing the vitality and general health contributed to his death dr a h shaeffer testified march 10 1896 i was well acquainted with capt b h bostwick for nearly thirty years or very soon after the close of the civil rebellion in which he was a union officer and knew him to have been wounded in said service and also knew him to be a frail debilitated sickly person and as i believe his deteriorated physical state of health resulting from his impaired health brought on or from his suffering from wounds did cause a liability of weakening of the tissues of the general system and the coats or tissues of the blood vessels as to cause cerebral hemorrhage and in my opinion the paralysis superinduced by weakening of coats of blood vessels by deteriorated condition of system was sole cause of his cerebral hemorrhage2 which was the cause of death i did not treat captain bostwiek but saw him repeatedly during his last sickness and do think that his case is one clearly to my mind resulting from causes meiitioned i have been a practicing physician for fortyseven years from these statements of reputable physicians who had the patient under their observation your comuttee believe that it requires no effort of the imagination to conclude that the death cause may be attributable to results of the soldiers army service stripped of technicalities the embolism or atheromatous hemorrhages of the brain which produced death were undeniably the sequence of the enemic condition and low vitality of the patient together with the failure of the diseased lungs to properly purify the blood before it was sent into the degenerated and impoverished arteries while the nondependent condition of claimant as found by the pension bureau cuts no figure in the case in view of the foregoing yet the facts concerning her property should be stated the testimony shows she owned real estate valued at 3 600 which was mortgaged for 3 510 at 6per cent interest and her property of other kinds amounted to about 970 the expense of interest repairs and taxes consumed nearly the entire

tendered his resignation as such september 16 1864 which was accepted september 19 1864 by the act of congress approved june 3 1884 it was intended by a general bill to give relief in this class of claims and it appears that mr anderson presented his ease to the war department under the act and that his case has been decided adversely because there is no record of a commission or appointment having been issued for him as of the grade and organization named there was then no governor of arkansas in the latter part of the summer of 1863 the secretary of war transmitted to maj gen john m schofield then commanding the department of the missouri authority to organize and equip union soldiers from citizens of arkansas in conformity with that authority general schofield in paragraph 5 of

instructed to appoint some officers to take immediate charge of organizing the troops the officer thus appointed was authorized to recommend with the concurrence of general mcneil competent and

remains that from september 10 1863 to february 16 1804 anderson was on duty and recognized as first lieutenant that his services as such were accepted by the government having obtained the benefit of andersons services the government ought not to set up a technical plea in bar of its obligation to make compensation therefor and your committee is of opinion that payment should he made mr anderson

measures i gave my assent to this proposition i expect to give my assent to it again when the vote is taken but i say now that i believe this measure to be a willothewisp i believe that by this bill we are undertaking to do circuitously that which we ought to do directly and which we have the power to do independently of any nati on the earth four conferences of the kind provided for in this bill have been held and it has been observed i think that at each conference the chance of obtaining the coinage of both gold and silver upon equal terms and so as to perform equal functions is getting further away from us we want to increase the volume of money in this country and we want the volume of money to keep pace with population and commerce and we want actual money what gives value to money it is the demand and it is this that gives value to any article it is use and demand that fies the price and value of all things hr speaker if this country alone can furnish the demand for the uantity of silver that is produced in the world then it can give the highest possible value and can sustain that which is asked namely a parity betw een the two metals it is insisted that we must have the agreement of other nations in order to sustain the parity or value of the two metals hen coined it is asked that we have a conference of this kind in order to secure the assent of england to bimetallism or to the free and equal use of both gold and silver in this country sir for eighty years england has refused to assent to bimetallism since 1816 she has declined to place silver and gold upon equal terms yet from that period up to the demonetization of silver in 1873 there was no disparity in the value of the two metals we do not need the concurrence of england in order to establish and maintain bimetallism nor can we get it because she is a creditor nation and it would not be to her interest to increase the volume of money which would be done by the free coinage of silver mer speaker from a partisan view it is of course immaterial to me or to the o this side of the house what course may be ursued by the party which is responsible for legislation here but sremember and i give it as a reminder to the other side that four years ago we had a platform declaring as i construed itand it was so construed all over this countryfor the free coinage of silver accompanied with a declaration about maintaining a parity between the two metals yet when that platform came to be construed the parties then in power construed it to mean the continuation of the single gold standard the republican party has now been placed in charge of the affairs of the government upon a platform declaring that they wiil do all that they can to promote the free coinage of silver by international agreement yet that platform is today being construed by a large and strong element of that party to mean a single gold standard they say that at the last election the issue was drawn between the single gold standard and the free coinage of silver and gold and that upon that issue the people have decided and therefore the platform must be construed in the light of events subsequent to the writing of the platform and that such events justify the conclusion that the plank in the platform means the maintenance of the present single gold standard and by this they argue thaton this question the people are evoluting and that they will never turn back to what those gentlemen term the barbaric system of the use of silver it is immaterial to us from a partisan standpoint what course the gentlemen on the other side may pursue but being interested in promoting the prosperity of the country in increasing the volume of money in furnishing to the people that character of money which will circulate freely and equally everywhere we demand as democrats the free coinage of silver and gold upon equal termsthat they may both perform in this country the functions of money and that this be done without waiting the advice aid or assent of any nation on earth rere the hammer fell r quigg it does seem to me that as this debate has proceeded the republicans of this body must feel a decided nausea at the meal which their committee on coinage weights and measures have invited them to digest in this bill they have heard from democrats of the sort that supported the mule ticket and from democrats of the sort that supported the bryan ticket and from pops of the sort that supported both tickets that they are going to vote for this bill and now republicans after having fought and won the most desperately contested campaign that this country ever saw upon the distinct proposition that free silver was a humbug and a wrong are asked to do something that throws a doubt upon the sincerity of their professions and tends to persuade the people that the republican position was wrong and that free silver was right you can no more get away from the fact that the country will receive our voteif today we pass this billas a concession to bryanism any more than you can get away from the proposition that we fought and won the battle of 1896 on the gold standard for that is how we did win it if the republicans who are asking us to pass this bill had had their way at st louis we should have adopted a straddle platform and should have been hopelessly and deservedly defeated i oppose this bill first because it is unnecessary as to its object second because it is inexpedient and unsuitable as to time and place and third because if anyresults are to follow either upon the business of the country or upon the welfare of the republican party they must be distinctly dangerous what is the use of the bill anyway the president of the united states has a machine for which we pay nearly 3 000 000 a year by which he can conduct diplomatic negotiations if he wants to find out the temper of any government upon any subject all he has to do is to set in motion the machinery ordinarily and regularly provided for him and he straightway discovers all that can be found out by any method of inquiry have we not proved by the results of three of these monetary conferences that the ordinary diplomatic machinery is as competent to get results as any such as is here proposed why sir we had one conference when silver and gold were at par and the question simply was how to keep them there yet it was impossible to reach an agreement we had another when silver and gold were only at two points difference and the question was how to bring them together just two points but even in that condition agreement was impossible we had a third when they were about twelve points off and at that conference nobody so much as suggested a plan by means of which he was willing to say on his reputation as an economist that he thought a ratio could be established and held we are now invited to create another conference and at a time when silver is not two nor ten nor twelve but sixteen points away from the ratio that is proposed and intended by the advocates of this bill the true ratio is now 32 to 1 not 16 to 1 and if we could not hold them together when they were together and could not reconcile them when they were only two points off or when they were only ten points off how can it be supposed that success in this bimetallic enterprise is now possible"],

dependent pension act of june 27 1890 it provided in substance that cases showing disabilities under the act of june 27 1890 should be rated the same as like disabilities of service origin the practical operation of that order was that a man claiming under the act of 1890 was not obliged to show that he was disabled to such a degree as to be unable to support himself in practice commissioner raum neglected to take into consideration the ability of the applicant to perform manual labor this case of charles t bennett came before the department of the interior may 27 1893 when the original claim was filed under the general law the evidence showed that bennett had not been in any way disabled or ifijured in the war when he filed his claim under the act of june 27 1890 the evidence showedwhat that he had a slight deafness in both ears now under the act of 1890 what was he obliged to show that he was suffering from a mental or physical disabilityof what kind of a permanent character and to what extent one that incapacitated him for the performance of manual labor that was a condition precedent he must be unable to perform manual labor and to what extent must that incapacity exist to such an extent that he can not earn a support in the language of the act in sucha degree as to render them unable to earn a support now this man bennett showed what that he was deaf in both ears although he could hear the ticking of a watch when placed within half an inch of either ear on that condition of facts he not having received any wound or injury and not having contracted disease in the line of duty while in the service and failing in his application under the general law he claims that he is entitled to a pension under the act of 1890 and that because he has a slight deafness of both ears he is incapacitated for manual labor to such an extent as to be unable to earn a support so it seems to me that the only just course which could possibly have been adoptedby the commissioner of pensions or the secretary of the interior was to revoke at once that order of commissioner raum which has led to so much misunderstanding and to so many untenable applicationswhether the number of claims thrown out whether the number of petitions properly rejected amounted to 100 000 or not in the very nature of things where we have laws dependent on papers too often improperly or improvidently executedwhere we have all the decisions made upon ex parte applications where we have almost every avenue of fraud or illegality open it would seem sometimes by design there is no reason why all the claims improperly filed should not be rejected whether they amount to one thousand or two thousand or a hundred thousand in other words the number of claims rejected if the claims be improper and fraudulent matters not because i think on both sides of the house no argument will be urged in favor of a fraudulent or dishonest pension the only thing we differ about is whether the doors should be opened wide or not and whether or not the ordinary rules of evidence bywhich fallible human testimony is tested shall be used in respect to pension claims
