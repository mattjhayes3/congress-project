or teaches the overthrow of the unitedstates government by force or violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods i believe that this amendment has been introduced by and has the support of several other members of the congress from both sides of the aisle it will be noted that i do not propose any change to section 1001 f 2 of title x which calls for an affirmative oath of allegiance to the united states the american association of university professors has pointed out i believe correctly that the disclaimer requirement contained in section 1001 f 1 is subject to the objections of vagueness possible unconstitutionality and invidiousness the association sums up its case as follows this disclaimer requirement which will apply to large numbers of young people seeking loans fellowships and grants to carry on their education and to many teachers and to consulting experts seems thoroughly harmful it singles out persons in education as objects of suspicion it imposes a test oath repugnant to our traditions and it exposes those signing the affidavit to the possibility of perjury prosecutions resting on vague allegations or improper and intimidating inquiries about their conduct and their beliefs the association makes out a good case an equally strong case against the disclaimer requirement has been made by the secretary of health education and welfare dr arthur s flemming dr flemming has pointed out that the requirement is first unnecessary second ineffectual and third expensive to administer here is what he says in this regard all persons involved in the administration of this act would have been able to deny funds to persons who themselves seek or who belong to organizations that believe in or teach the overthrow of the government by force or violence even though this provision had never been inserted it is clear that such persons are not entitled to and should not receive funds from the unitedstates government requiring persons who receive funds under this act to sign an affidavit and an oath of allegiance will not uncover any persons who themselves seek or who belong to organizations that believe in or teach the overthrow of the government by force or violence such persons have no scruples about signing such an affidavit and taking such an oath the inclusion of this requirement in the national defense education act will make it necessary for educators and students to go through a procedure that results in unnecessary expenditures on the part of the government without making a contribution to national security there is no question but that this requirement has caused great concern among educators most educators i believe accept the oath of allegiance in this legislation we require an oath of allegiance in many areas of governmental endeavor but the disclaimer provision in the form of a negative affidavit they regard as a potential threat to their profession recently dr a whitney griswold president of yale university wrote a letter to dr flemming secretary of health education and welfare commending dr flemming for his statement to which i have just referred in his letter president griswold refers to the instinctive dislike that educators have for a requirement of this sort he points out that symbolically such a measure is offensive and that it is not efficacious as a public safeguard tending to alienate the good will of the loyal citizen without gaining corresponding advantage in protecting the government against the actions or intentions of the disloyal he points out further that the requirement also has the weakness of giving the public a false sense of security which if it became too literal and too strong might lead to our undoing loyaltystates dr griswoldcan only be won by the powerful attraction of unarmed truth implicit in the educational process it cannot be induced or assured by oaths exacted in advance as conditions to participation in this process finally dr griswold warns us that a negative affidavit of this sort is especially distasteful when it is required of young people just entering the most important phase of their educational experience as it seems to represent lack of confidence in those young people and in their future as well as in the educational process itself dr griswolds letter merits wide attention and with his permission and the permission

was the only thing that enabled a people to choose between right and wrong between wisdom and foolishness between unenlightened selfishness and respect for the public interest hence they promoted free schools and a liberal education it is improbable that they could foresee a time in this republic when the free schools would not only give the youth of the land the power to choose but actually to set the standards of right and wrong wisdom and foolishness benevolence and selfishness it is a far more important thing to be able to set standards than merely to judge actions by standards imposed by other agencies of society and it is true that the schools exercised their original functions so well that society has entrusted them with ever increasing responsibilities today the whole world of the child almost from infancy to adulthood revolves around the school he remains under its influence from the early formative years of the nursery school and the kindergarten until he is called to man the defensive forces of the nation or to fill the workshops offices and professions his waking hours are filled with tasks and activities and thoughts connected with his school life the nature and the direction of his training in the school will determine his life attitudes and practices whether in the field of politics or economy or social understanding the power and the prestige of the school as an institution tends somewhat to eclipse the individuals who direct the learning process the teacher who sits behind the desk in the classroom actually holds the throttle which controls the mighty engine of progress in the arts and sciences in national and international relationships in ethics itself whether we shall go forward safely and surely toward a better world or be wrecked on the obstructions of evil and uncertainty and doubt depends on the skill and judgment of the teacher an institution after all is only the lengthened shadow of a man the teacher is the school and the school holds the key to the future of america and that future as has often been said is a race between education and catastrophe two things stand in the way of full realization of the potentialities of the school they are simply prestige for the teacher and money in this country we assume that prestige must be earned for anyone we do not accord prestige because of the accident of birth or because someone has managed to insinuate himself into office public or private prestige is earned through skill in performance of duty through complete devotion to the demands of ones calling and through unwavering integrity and dependability i insist that teachers have already earned that prestige and it should be accorded them one of the few criticisms of american education made by visiting teachers from foreign countries is that teachers in this country fail to receive the prestige due them my reasons for making these statements here in the congress of the united states is that i feel every elected representative of the people has a definite responsibility in the field of education i in common with many of my colleagues in this body know something of the teaching profession of its frustrations as well as its accomplishments having been a teacher myself on both the high school and the college level i have two sisters a brother an uncle and an aunt now serving the public schools of my native state further my wife and i have six children enjoying the unparalleled advantages of a public school system we want them to grow daily in knowledge and virtue and we crave an equal opportunity for every child in the land i do not know of any specific legislative enactment which could confer prestige on the teaching profession but i do feel that we need to combat by word and thought whatever antiintellectualism may exist in this country we must treat the whole educational process with the gravity it needs to preserve a free government of free people given an outspoken understanding and a wholehearted sympathy with the difficulties of the schools and of teachers on the highest national level we may hope to raise immeasurably the prestige that rightly belongs to the schools of our nation as for the financial needs of the schools the congress is in a position to do something definite incessant wranglings over amounts that should be appropriated over methods of distribution over control of final expenditure serve only to confuse the real issue which is that we must spend much more money on education whether the money originates in the tax offices of the nation the state or the locality it all comes from the same american taxpayers it is folly to assume that a centralized control of the expenditure of every last dime on the local level could be as judicious as community management without a vast bureaucracy of unimaginative ana unadaptive pseudoeducators i favor immediate dedication of a much more realistic share of our national income to the vital cause of public education lest by saving a little in the name of economy we may lose all in the breakdown of our entire system of communicating the achievements and the aspirations of the past to the rising generations"]]}
