the same but protests are pouring in here from the great consuming masses of the united states and from every section of the country against this bill and demanding its defeat it would be unfair to the great constituency which i have the honor to represent on the floor of this house if in addition to voting against it i did not also register my protest i believe with exgovernor cummins of iowa now a senator of the united states from that great state who declared not long ago thatall the robberies and thefts committed by all the insurance officers since the life insurance business originated do not amount to the extortion due to the dingley bill in one year i desire to supplement that statement by adding that there has been more money extorted from the consumers pockets in this country during the existence of the dingley bill by it than the entire cost of the civil war in this measure it seems to be a gigantic struggle among its beneficiaries to see who can plunge their hands into the consumers pockets the deepest it appears by the declarations of the advocates of this measure on the other side of this house that the sole object of this measure is to enact legislation that will enable the manufacturing producer to plunder and pillage 80 000 000 consumers and take money from them and transfer it to the pockets of the beneficiaries of this unjust and oppressive measure against this policy i most earnestly protest i warn the republican party now and here that if you pass this measure as now proposed you will sound your own death knell the indigpation of the great majority of the american people upon whom you are imposing unjust and unreasonable burdens by its terms will confront you and they will visit their punishment upon you at the polls at their first opportunity and will drive you from power when you return to your constituency for their approval of your official conduct they will repudiate you and withhold their indorsement of your public action in your national platform you promised the people of this country that you would revise the tariff and it was understood by every citizen in this republic that by that declaration you meant revision downward that you would lower their high taxes and not raise them as you are undertaking to do by this measure this measure is not a revision downward but a raise over the dingley bill the highest tarifftax measure the country ever had of 1 56 per cent you are doing this at a time when the people are crying for relief from public burdens and at a time when they are least able to bear an additional expense at a time when labor is idle when distress is on every hand when business stagnation prevails everywhere when the expense of living is the highest ever known when idleness prevails in every industrial center of our common country you are enacting this unwise legislation at the behest of a favored few who are the beneficiaries of it in order that they may further fatten off of the consumers of the country a protective tariff for protections sake is fundamentally wrong in principle and unjust in practice to legislate money out of one mans pocket into that of another is indefensible under the institutions of a republican form of government and an imposition on a free people in the doctrine of my party a tariff for the purpose of raising revenue to defray the expenses of the government economically administered is an approved cardinal principle to which i most heartily subscribe and whatever protection it gives incidentally we approve but to levy a tax upon the consumers of the country which gives abnormal profits to persons engaged in certain industrial pursuits and deny to the people of the country competition is a doctrine in which i can find no justification either in morals or common justice it destroys the equality of all men before the law it discriminates in favor of one class and against the other it gives to one an immunity which it denies to the other a protective tariff creates predatory wealth and is legalized graft it has done more to debase the public conscience and lower the moral standard of the nation than any other class of legislation the tariff baron to sustain the system is the willing victim of the campaign committee the ward heeler and the ballotbox stuffer from him the funds are raised to corrupt the electorate by such disgraceful and corrupt methods the great propaganda of protection has been foisted and continued as a burden on the american people aye verily it has debased the public conscience and lowered the moral standard of the republic through its putrid stream has flown the most disgraceful conduct and inexcusable crimes the calendars of our courts have recorded you promised the people you would revise the tariff downward are you now repudiating that promise you are sending this promise solemnly made to the great scrap pile of unredeemed pledges and broken promises made in the past but sir there is a ray of hope for the oppressed people if we are to believe the reports which come from the white house the president who was a party to this promise and profited by it the same as you did has said unless you change this bill he will take a hand in the scramble here for spoils and have the manifold wrongs existing in this bill rectified so that it shall in some measure conserve the public good he demands that the great and imperious tariff barons shall yield to the public demands if he does not the public serves notice on him that he is serving his last term in the high office he now holds by the appropriations already made by the sixtieth congress for the period ending june 30 1910 there will be created a deficit in the national treasury amounting to 265 000 000 in the presidents message to this congress he stated that by july 1 1909 there would be a deficit of over 100 000 000 that under the dingley law which was prohibitive in many of its provisions as a revenue raiser insufficient revenues were being raised to meet the expenses of the government and an urgent necessity existed for provision being made to raise revenue to meet and liquidate the government expenses this is occurring under republican legislation and under the highest tariff the country has ever known sir the people of this country hailed with delight and relief the expiation of the sixtieth congress it appropriated in two years out of the peoples money the sum of 2 050 000 000 it was the most extravagant congress ever convened under the dome of the capitol by its enormous appropriations it was planning a way for an excuse to avoid a reduction of the tariff and the lowering of taxation in behalf of a suffering public and out of this extravagant proceeding we find its natural offspring the payne bill let us examine a few schedules contained in this bill there is one in particular against which 80 000 000 consumers protest and from hearly every merchants association in this country a protest has been filed from one of them i quote in the payne tariff bill reported to congress a material and unnecessary advance is made on two commodities which directly and seriously affect 80 000 000 consumers and work a decided benefit to a comparatively few manufacturers of these lines we refer to the over 20 per cent increase over the 60 per cent tariff rate on foreign hosiery which increase in fact means an advance of 33j per cent on the present tariff the payne bill further provides a greater increase on leather gloves than that cited on hosiery this increase being no less than 128 to 150 per cent on schmachen 60 to 140 per cent on lamb and 33 to 103 per cent on kid gloves seventyfive per cent of these commodities used in this country are already manufactured here these two sections of the payne bill are radically wrong for by them every user of hosiery and gloves is indirectly taxed for the benefit of the already highly protected domestic manufacturer and by the excessive duties imposed by these two sections the importation of these commodities is prohibited thereby depriving the treasury of the revenue therefrom in view of these facts we urgently request that you not only seek to correct these defects pointed out but that you exert your influence to secure these corrections and thus bring about that which the entire people have put themselves on record as wantingan honest revision of the tariff here you have the way the merchants association of indianapolis characterize the provisions of this bill in their petition they demand an honest revision of the tariff by this congress the legitimate and logical inference from the above strong language used is that this proposed revision is a dishonest one they tell you what the people want and what they understood by your promise ignore them if you will but mark the prediction if you do they will resent it at the first opportunity afforded and you will suffer for your misconduct this is but one of the many hundreds of petitions of like character which are pouring into this house it is an appeal from a patient and suffering public for you to do right by the terms of these two schedules you have aroused the wrath and indignation of every woman in the land you invite and provoke their opposition and in the next campaign you will not find enough peaceful territory in all this broad land whereon to hold a party caucus much less win an election the women of this country are powerful enough to elect or defeat any man or party for office to win any political fight ever waged and to carry to a victorious result any contest ever provoked of their cooperation we are assured from the richest to the poorest the severest of condemnation will be visited upon you will you ignore the appeal of every woman and child in this broad land to serve the glove and hosiery barons of this country have you become so impregnated with tariff graft licensed robbery that you will not hear these people who preserve the purity of the nations honor and uphold the virtue of the american home deny them if you will but you will regret it as long as the name of this measure is spoken of by the human tongue sir i wish for a moment to discuss another tariff schedule the iron and steel manufacturers have always been the especial favorites of republican legislation and for thirty years they have unmercifully plundered the american people andrew carnegie the great steel king of the world testified before the committee on was and means that these products needed no protection judge gary did the same yet this bill generously protects them under the dingley bill these products were protected 36 96 per cent by the payne bill 36 15 per cent a reduction of 81 per cent by the dingley bill steel rails were protected 7 84 per ton by the payne bill 3 92 these products need no protection i here read indisputable proof of this fact in the book of james howard bridge on the inside history of the carnegie steel company page 312 in a letter from mr schwab to mr frick you will find this statement as to the future even on low prices i am most sanguine i know positively that england can not produce pig iron at actual cost for less than 11 50 per ton even allowing no profit on raw materials and can not put pig iron into a rail with their most efficient works for less than 7 50 per ton this would make rails at net cost to them 19 we can sell at that price and ship abroad so as to net us 16 at the works for foreign business nearly as good as home business has been what is true of rails is equally true of other steel products as a result we are going to control the steel business of the world you know we can make rails for less than 12 per ton leaving a nice margin on foreign business besides this foreign costs are going to increase year by year because they do not have the raw materials while ours is going to decrease the result of all this is that we will be able to sell our surplus abroad run our works all the time and get the best practice and cost in this way this concern now has a monopoly of this business and controls the markets of the world it makes steel rails for 12 per ton and sells them for 28a net profit of 16 per ton or 1331 per cent they can make them cheaper than they can be made in any other country in the world why protect them such protection is prohibitive and the government derives no revenue from it and it enables them to plunder the consumers of this country the trust fixes the price in england it costs 19 per ton to manufacture steel rails ocean freight 1 dingley tariff 7 84 the actual cost of english rails laid down in our market is 27 84 per ton no fear of competition in this regard in this industrial line this bill is exceptionally generous tb the boot and shoe industry it proposes a tax on the consumers of this commodity of universal use of from 15 to 25 per cent since this discussion began i have received a letter from one of the largest shoe manufacturers in this country which is as follows columbus onio march 29 1909"], [0.011559844017028809, 0.9884401559829712, 1, "i have been expecting to hear some speeches on that side of the house in line with the one just made by the gentleman from illinois i knew that the republican side of this house had realized that it was absolutely necessary to come to the defense of the paynealdrich tariff law for that law is indeed in bad repute throughout the country the high price of foodstuff doubled and trebled under your tariff after it leaves the producer is pinching with hunger millions of our people and driving them to vow they will eat no more meat forever when your party looks upon the distress and suffering that it has wrought in its efforts to serve its tariff masters it tries to lead the people away from the truth and in the hope of hiding the hand that smites us it declares that the farmers are responsible for the high prices of foodstuff the meat trust and high tariff twin monsters of distress and misery the offspring of the republican party are responsible for the terrible conditions that confront the masses of the people today the farmer who sells his beef on foot for q cents per pound is far removed from the unreasonabie profits that the beef trust receives when it sells that same heef for 30 and 40 cents per pound to the consumer and the nman who gets a dollar per bushel for his wheat is far removed from the 12 and 14 that the beaten biscuits and the shortloaf bread brings in the market before i close i shall refer to some other things mentioned by the gentleman from illinois now while we are considering the agricultural bill i want to discuss some matters regarding agriculture especially appropriate at this time when i came here i found that the agricultural interests of the south were not being treated right by congress i saw that these interests could be helped by legislative action and i set myself to the task of bringing certain matters to the attention of this body and to show xlv 9 how we could be materially benefited by the enactment of certain fair and just laws and while i have not by any means been able to do all the things that needed to be done i feel that i have accomplished some things of real value to our people the gentleman from illinois has said something about the high price of cotton and i wish to say in the outset that no people on this earth have ever produced any crop under such difficulties as the people of the south produced the last cotton crop we have never produced a cotton crop that cost as much as the crop that has been marketed and the remnant of which is now being marketed the high cost of living and the high price of agricultural implements and so forth have contributed to the great cost of producing that cotton crop and the high cost of these things that the farmer used in making this crop is the fruit of the republican party but i want to say a word in passing about cotton cotton has not brought any more than it ought to have brought when you consider the cost of production and the short crop made in the light of the worlds denmand for cotton fifteen cents per pound or 75 per bale is not too much when we consider the price that the consumer has to pay for the finished productcotton in cloth we are told that a bale of cotton weighing 500 pounds when manufactured into socks at 10 cents per pair brings 350 and at 20 cents per pair brings 700 and handkerchiefs at three for a quarter brings 500 i wish to say to my new england friends that if they had the natural monopoly that we have in the south if they owned the cotton belt as we do they would make us pay 20 cents per pound for cotton every year and fill their newspapers and nmgazines full of arguments until they convinced us that we were getting it cheap and that we ought to be thankful to then and to providence that nxe did not have to pay more than 20 cents per pound cotton is being put to more uses now than ever mercerized cotton so resembles silk and is so much cheaper that it is being substituted for silk it is used in the nmanufacture of woolen goods and the demand for it as a substitute for wool is on the increase cotton is the master production and enters into nearly every phase of american life it was behind cotton bales at new orleans that jackson won the victory over the british wherever the american soldier goes the white fiber of the cotton field goes with him and wherever he strikes camp the field is dotted with white tents made of cotton the flying sails of the ships at sea come from the snowy cotton fields of the south the cord that rings the bell on the train and puts on the emergency brake in time of danger is made of cotton in the springtime when the agricultural army is in lotion cotton enters into the paraphernalia of the mule a cotton backhand gauges the depth that tie plow shall go whether shallow or deep and cotton plow lines constitute the strong cords that guide and control the stubborn mule in traveling through the cotton belt on a warim day there is nothing more refreshing than a deep draught of water from the old oaken bucket that hangs in the well and here the cotton rope is the kindly agent that brings it from the cool dark depths below if while strolling through the cotton belt you should find a swarm of mosquitoes conspiring to disturb your rest at night there is the mosquito bar made of cotton spreading its white wings above your head hovering about you while you sleep dressmakers and tailors have at last learned how to make up cotton goods in the most fascinating and attractive way the cotton suit that i wore here last summer and those worn by other members looked better than the flannel suits worn by other gentlemen here and they did not cost onethird as much they were cooler and more comfortable every way i have advocated it and i believe the day will come when the southern people will wear cotton almost exclusively from april to september by this means the south will consume nearly 4 000 000 bales more than is now consumed for spring and summer cotton is the coolest and cheapest wearing apparel in the world and our people are at last beginning to realize the value of patronizing this home industry civilized men the world over are coining to know that cotton is the healthiest and most comfortable fabric that can be worn next to the skin the man who suffers from colds and grip in the winter by reason of wearing woolens next tme skin can obtain health and happiness by putting on the souths sensible garment made of cotton cotton is used i nmaking wheals for automobiles and nearly 500 000 bales a year are being used for this purpose when we go to using cotton as bagging for wrapping our cotton bales we will consume a great deal for this purpose wei will make a rough bagging and soak it in a composition of cottonseed oil and coal tar which will give it sufficient weight and make it waterproof and this will become the greatest cotton bagging in the world there are more people who wear cotton goods who use cotton in various ways than ever before in the history of cotton production there are more cotton factories in the world and more men weaving cotton into cloth than ever before in our history so the fairly good price that we have received for cotton this season is accounted for as i will show you later by natural conditionsshort crop and increased demand for cotton and cotton goodstogether with the work of the farmer and merchant in intelligently handling the crop in the selling season you may make up your minds to one thing and that is the intelligence and courage of the cotton producers of the south have been aroused and our people are at last beginning to figure on the cost of production and they are beginning to estimate what the crop yield in money will be when a reasonable profit is added to the cost of producton and i may add they are actually beginning to demand the cost of production with a reasonable profit added it is high time that the farmer had something to say about the price that he should receive for his cotton since he is about the only fellow who has not asserted his godgiven right to demand a fair return for his efforts and his labor he has been badly imposed upon but he is at last beginning to assert himself intelligently his representatives in congress have exposed the illegitimate speculation done in the exchange condemned its rules and had investigations made by the federal government when we commenced to inquire into the conduct of the new york exchange we found it handling fictitious products instead of cotton bogus sales were made and no cotton ever required to fill a contract differences were settled with money and it was never intended that cotton should play any part in the transaction the practice that obtained under the rules of the exchange did not contemplate a delivery of cotton and this irresponsible concern selfconstituted judge of cotton prices had permission to sell in unlimited quantities margins without actually demanding the delivery of cotton or being required to deliver it prior to the agitation of this question by myself and other southern representatives and intelligent action on the part of the growers the exchange controlled by the bears in the interest of the spinners of new england and the united kingdom had its way the new york exchange sold in a season a hundred million bales of fictitious stuff called cotton they did not have any cotton they did not want any cotton they had no use for cotton not a pound of cotton figured in their transaction no demand was made upon the producer for a single bale and yet this aggregation of men composing the exchange assumed the right to fix the price of the real cotton the producer was not considered in the matter of determining the price of cotton the law had permitted the exchange to fix the price so long that the producer accepted what they did and said nothing and the spinners of the world had come to look to the exchange to fix the price upon the raw cotton desiring to buy the raw material as cheaply as possible their sympathies were of course on the bear side and in times past they have assisted the bears in creating the impression throughout the cotton belt that a large crop was being made and that they had plenty of cotton on hand at the mills to run them for a long time and that the price would not be very good for a long time the cotton producer did not know what the trouble was he knew that something was at work depriving him of a fair price for his cotton the evil has been pointed out if we could have a real cotton exchange spot cotton would be in demand and the producer would be consulted as he should be about the price of cotton thc cotton grower has been enabled to see just how he has been imposed upon by the exchange that claimed to reflect the operation of the law of supply and demand and that it misrepresented the facts regarding the supply of cotton always on the side of a large crop and low prices very often it covered the country with circular letters claiming that there would be an overproductionmore cotton than the world could use out of all this agitation has come great good to the southland the people of the cotton belt have at last realized that much depends upon the handling of the cotton crop intelligently time was when the whole south sold cotton on a declining market in fact the bulk of the cotton crop was sold on a declining market just let the market break and all was bustle and stir in the cotton belt the people with cotton to sell rushed to the market place they did not realize that they were the masters of the situation that if they would quit selling at destructive prices the law of supply and demand would control in the interest of reasonable prices they felt that they were in the grasp of some mysterious power and that they would have to hurry and get rid of their cotton before it became a drug on the market but air chairman times have changed farmers and merchants in the south now look in amazement on the time when they obeyed the new england and foreign spinners bear agents in the exchange they know more about cotton its uses and abuses now than they have ever known when the exchange in control of the forces that make low prices undertakes to fix a price low and unprofitable to the cotton producer cotton goes to the market very slowly and very little is sold when there is a sharp break in the price such as once caused a rush to the market our people quit selling and wait for the return of a reasonable price they are forced to do this or be robbed one thing is certain since our people have become aroused and are becoming acquainted with the forces that have been at work robbing and plundering the cotton growers of the south since the regulation of the cotton exchanges have been receiving the attention of southern members in congress the evil features of the exchanges pointed out and condemned cotton has fared better and the average price during these years has been higher than for any like period when the exchange undisturbed executed its own sweet will the theory of a spotcotton exchange has been put into practice this season haynes scales brown and patten bought cottonreal cottonand held it for a profit and therein lay their power as factors in helping to fix the price of cotton when the foreign spinner and the new england spinner went into an agreement in october to quit buying cotton to withdraw from the market and put it back to 10 cents these men that i have named bought actual cotton and what happened mr chairman what effect did it have on the spinners it made them sit up and take notice that when the farmer and the merchant of the south were inclined to demand and help secure a fair price for cotton that men with money saw their opportunity to make more money by dealing in cotton men who could command large sums of money knew that the crop was short and that the people of the south had the courage and the intelligence to refuse to accept a low and unreasonable price so they bought what cotton they could and held it where was the spinner then with his secret agreement to injure the cotton farmer by depriving him of fair prices and living profits he was up in the air with the producer handling his cotton intelligently and selling it sparingly and men of means buying what cotton they could get and holding it actual cotton became the controlling power then what happened the foreign spinner broke his agreement without a word of warning and hurried back to the market place bidding for cotton real cotton next came the new england spinner and competitive buying under the law of supply and demand of real cotton fixed the price the principle of the spotcotton exchange was at work and real cotton was in demand for the spinners of the world had to have it i was instrumental in passing the law requiring statistics to be gathered from the manufacturers of cotton in the united states as the printed hearings in the agricultural committee will show i brought this matter to the attention of the committee on agriculture and proved by the chief of the bureau of statistics that if it were just and fair to make reports on crop conditions and have gin reports as to the number of bales of cotton ginned for the benefit of the manufacturer it was fair to the cotton producer to have the government report the number of bales of cotton on hand at the various factories in the united states i introduced a bill for this purpose and made a speech on it in the house it was so plain that my cause was just that members on both sides of the house told me that i was right and that they would vote for my bill mr lever of south carolina introduced a joint resolution on the same subject he was a faithful member of the committee on agriculture and was present when i first brought the matter to the attention of the committee in order that we should not fail to have action taken on the matter at that session of congress i had my bill referred to the committee on agriculture of which i was a member then i introduced a joint resolution which was referred to the committee on the census the same committee to which mr leveis resolution had been referred the lever resolution as amended had some of the dates contained in mine as to the time of reporting it was reported and passed the house late in february and is now the law i did not quibble with the committee as to whose name the resolution should bear mr levers or mine i was anxious that the law be passed i knew that it was meeting the just demands of the cotton growers of the south and that it would enable the cotton producer to sell his cotton intelligently because he would have the information necessary regarding the amount of raw cotton on hand at the mills the march report will give him the number of bales of old cotton on hand in the united states and this will be valuable information in determining the size of the cotton crop for the coming year time was when the new england manufacturer would help the bears in the exchange by claiming to have all the cotton that they would need for quite a while the producer did not knowhe had no way of knowing the producer became frightened and would sell his cotton as rapidly as he could market it but since he knows by these reports how muclh cotton is on hand he can judge for himself what the market ought to be and govern himself in the light of this information it has enabled him to see the folly of rushing his cotton to market and selling it at destructive prices with this information about the supply of cotton at the cotton mills he can know something of what the real demand for real cotton will be when i brought this matter to the attention of the committee on agriculture and when i urged this legislation in the house it was my purpose to do simple justice by the cotton producers of the south it was my desire to do the same for them that congress had done for the manufacturer of cotton it had given the manufacturer of cotton in the crop report and in the giuners report all the information that he needed to run his business intelligently and it was nothing but simple justice that the producer of cotton should have the benefit of a government report telling him from time to time the amount of baled cotton on hand in the united states he needed this in order to run his business intelligently it was not my purpose to injure the cotton mills but it was my desire purely and wholly to be as just to the man who makes the stuff that feeds the cotton mills as the government has been to the man who owns the cotton mill the manufacturer knows how the cotton crop is progressing in the spring and summer for the crop report tells him he knows how much cotton is being ginned in the ginning season for the gingers report tells him twice a month he has all the information that he could wishall that is necessary for his businessbut before the passage of this law that i suggested requiring the reports on the amount of baled cotton on hand at the cotton mills of the country the manufacturer had the producer in the dark he knew nothing absolutely nothing about the supply of cotton in the united states here is what one of the newspapers of wall street in the gentlemans state of new york had to say about me at that time expressing the wish of the southern cotton planters representative heflin of alabama introduced in congress the other day a joint resolution instructing the director of the census to ascertain from the manufacturers of cotton in the united states every sixty days the amount that has been purchased and manufactured during the previous two months that would he a fine thing for the cotton planters the information would enable them to know just how much cotton the manufacturers had on hand just how large the supply at any particular time happened to be knowing this the planters could act more intelligently in sending their cotton to the market having the cotton manufacturer where the hairor cottonwas short planters could make him pay what price they liked naturally the manufacturers do not want to give up any such information as a matter of fact the heflin resolution is paternalistic populistic and somewhat inclined to be anarchistic so for doing for the cotton producer just exactly what congress has done for the cotton manufacturer i am denounced by papers in new york as being a populist a paternalist and an anarchist the criticism of these papers is the best evidence that i am in the right and doing my duty last year even after the law for obtaining the amount of cotton on hand went into effect some of our cotton manufacturers in september claimed that they had enough old cotton to run them for a long time but the government report on baled cotton for november 1 1909 the first report under this new law knocked this claim of the manufacturers to pieces and the southern farmer and merchant for the first time in the history of our country saw behind the doors of the manufacturer and cotton advanced in price then in november they gave out the statement that with what old cotton they had on hand and what new cotton they had bought they would have enough to run the mills without buying any more but the january report on baled cotton by the government disclosed the fact that the bulk of the cotton sold had been shipped to foreign countriesthat is it was not to be found in this country then what happened men with moneybig moneybought cotton as an investment patten bought 3 000 000 bales they had information that told them the condition in the cotton world t the producer had the information that he needed to enable him to sell his cotton intelligently and the man with money to invest in a safe thing had the information to show him his opportunity and for one time the theory of a spotcotton exchange was put into practice the dealing was in cotton and it took cotton to fill the contract for the first time producer and manufacturer stood on equal footing so in bringing this matter to the attention of the committee on agriculture and discussing it in the house it was my purpose to give the cotton farmer and merchant of the south the information that they needed and were entitled tothe same character of information that was given to the manufacturer long ago if it was fair to give to the manufacturer crop reports and ginners reports which furnished him all the information that he needed about the cotton crop it was equally fair to give to the cotton producer some information regarding the movement and consumption of cotton and to inform him about the supply of cotton in the country before this proposition of gathering statistics as to the amount of baled cotton in the united states became the law the manufacturer of cotton had all the information that the government could afford to help him run his business and the cotton producer had none absolutely none except that manufactured by the bears in the gambling exchange and the information that they gave him was given for the purpose of making him sell his cotton as rapidly as lie could possibly market it and this he did for many years at low and destructive prices the manufacturers could claim that they had enough cotton to run them for quite a long time and the bears would spread the news all over the south and the farmer who produced cotton for the world had no way of telling how much was on hand at the mills how to get at the truth of the situation he groped in the dark helpless in the hands of bears and spinners but now since justice in a measure has been done him he is enabled to get at the truth by the aid of a government report two things operated to raise the price of cottonthe fact that england realized from accurate crop reports as made by farmers men who knew the actual condition of the crop that the crop was short and the fact that the spinners here knew that the november report on baled cotton would disclose the fact that the bulk of the crop was going and had gone abroad then what happened actual cotton was in demand and a lay was comingand that day was november 1when the truth of the amount of actual cotton available in the united states would be made known we had simply devised the means for obtaining the truth and only the knowledge of the truth regarding the cotton business will bring about the operation of the law of supply and demand and this is what the producer of cotton has been struggling for for years and years i do not object to the exchange that does a legitimate businessthat means to deliver and have delivered the commodity in which it deals i am heartily in favor of such an exchange such an exchange is conducted in bremen germany if a man contracts for a thousand bales of cotton he is certain to have a thousand bales of cotton delivered to him this helps the producer for he nmust furnish the cotton such an exchange is a useful thing and when its contracts are made and filled it takes real stuff to fill them and the producer is helped by their operation a horse is a useful aninmal but you would not harness him up hitch him to a buggy pull the bridle off and let him go about at will with your family in the buggy an exchange is all right if it is properly harnessed and controlledmade to conform to certain just rulesbut it is not safe for the producer to be left at the mercy of the bear speculator when that speculator has the moral support and financial backing of the spinning interests of the world hence the necessity for certain regulation of the exchange i have seen the price of cotton futures in the exchange a cent and a half lower than the price of real cotton in the local market the representatives of the farmers union are here they came to urge legislation that will give the farmer an honest and stable market for his cotton and grain and free him from the uncertainty of the gambling exchange just before coming to washington mr c s barrett president of the farmers union issued an address december 29 1909 a part of which i will read in january of the new year the farmers union represented by national officers by experts and by state officials the country over will assemble in washington there to make a determined and organized fight against the new york cotton exchange and all other like aggregations that use its methods or variations of them to pick the pockets of the rural population of this country the time has come for the politicians the representatives and senators who profess friendship for the farmer to show their friendship in something more substantial than promissory notes compounded of language and evasion we want action against the new york cotton exchange we demand action against the new york cotton exchange we have at last learned how to go about the enforcement of the rights of american farmers and that is by using the ballot as a bullet to that end at the coming session we expect to keep our eyes on every member of congress seeing how far his professions of friendship are borne out in action upon the floor and marking indelibly those congressmen aligned directly or indirectly against the farmers interests we have secured data minute and detailed regarding the methods of the new york cotton exchange and we are prepared to submit it to any congressional committee with a demand for action thereupon but we also expect to push this war to a successful conclusion regardless of who is lined up with us or against us playing lottery with the products upon which the individual and collective prosperity of our people depends must cease economically it is wrong ethically it is wrong betting on the nations products is an indefensible practice that reaches into the pockets of yourself that takes clothes from the backs of your families that takes food from their mouths and that keeps education from the children who are to carry on your name in this world i am heartily in favor of this legislation i have advocated it for years if we can destroy gambling in fictitious stuff we will establish all over the south spotcotton exchanges and then the producer will have some voice in fixing the price of cotton the bear gamblers in the exchange have insisted for years that if we did not permit them to gamble on our cotton we would not know what it is worth that we must rely on a concern that does not use a pound of cotton to grant us a reasonable price we have had time and again an example of the gamblers generosity especially do i recall a time when the producer and merchant offered no resistancethey did not know how to resistin fact they trusted the exchange implicitly and what did it do it reduced the price of cotton to 4 cents per pound far below the cost of production and bankrupted thousands of farmers and merchants in the south hereafter the producer of cotton is going to be a factor in fixing the price of cotton senator john t morgan in the last speech that he ever made in alabama said the day will come when the producer will fix the price of cotton at his own door what the producer wants and must have ultiinately is something stable in cotton prices the cotton industry is in a hazardous condition when it must depend on the mood of this or that set of gamblers we have seen recently when the cotton crop was nearly all soldwhen real cotton cut no figure at all in cotton transactionsthe bear gamblers in the new york exchange in one week reduce the price of cotton 15 per bale just think of that in that transaction no real cotton was bought or soldno real cotton delivered a majority of the regular members of the exchange are always bears ald they represent the spinning interests now it is known to all men that the spinner wants to buy cotton just as cheaply as he can well if the bear represents the spinner and he is nine times out of ten the controlling power on the gambling exchange how is it possible for the producer who wants a reasonable price for his cotton to have a fair deal when his deadly enemy the bear decides the case the producer does not demand and he does not want outrageous prices for his cotton he does want and he does demand fair prices and living profits the argument of the cotton gamblers that we would have no market but for them that they must tell us what it is worth is rot of the commonest order the pigiron industry is vast and it is worth millions and yet there is no gambling in pig iron as there is in cotton still the pigiron business flourishes in spite of the failure of a gambling exchange to aid it there is no speculation in futures on wool and yet the woolen industry is worth millions and millions and always does a flourishing business no speculative exchange tells us the price of wool there is no speculation in futures on hay and yet the hay crop in the united states is greater than the cotton crop and there is a good hay market and the gambling exchange does not tell the hay grower what his hay will be worth now then if the man who owns pig iron and the man who owns wool and the man who owns hay all have sense enough to demand and obtain a reasonable price year after year for their product without the interference of a gambling exchange is it not reasonable that the southern farmer and merchant can and will demand a fair price for cotton now i desire to discuss a few other things while a melmber of the committee on agriculture i introduced a bill and got it favorably reported by the committee to prevent any employee of the government from selling information regarding the cotton crop to the cotton gamlers of the country and to prevent making false reports or giving out any information before the day fixed to publish this information i introduced a resolution in the house denying the correctness of the cottoncrop estimate made by the department of agriculture for 1907 and i proved before the committee that the department had overestimated the crop the evidence finally showed that it was estimated at 600 000 bales too much i helped to pass the burleson law standardizing cotton r dcstaking this power away from the new york exchange i amended the law regarding crop reports so that the farmer himself should be consulted and not have to rely on other classes of men to make these reports as was done before the law as i wrote it provides and now reads shall be gathered so far as practicable from practical farmers and i said if you should ask about the practice that obtained in courts you would not consult a farmer or a doctor you would ask a lawyer if you wanted to know the facts about an epidemic of disease in a community you would not ask a farmer or a lawyer but you would ask a doctor and i said if you want to know the true condition about growing crops you should consult the honest farmers of the south and you will get the truth and i first suggested and helped to secure the law requiring reports on baled cotton on hand from time to time in the united states i mention these things that the house and the country may know that as a member of the committee on agriculture i was alive to the interest of my people and trying to do something of value for the farmers of the south with no desire to boast of what i have been able to accomplish for them i challenge the speaker of this house to name a single member on that committee who has done more than i have for southern agriculture my service on that committee was such and i refer to this with pride that president barrett of the farmers union of america wrote to the speaker and asked him to reappoint me in that letter mr barrett said mr heflin has shown himself in strong sympathy with the farming people of this country north as well as south and he also said that i was giving and had given great study to agricultural matters if i had not been faithful on the committee on agriculture could i have had such a testimonial as that president jordan of the southern cotton association wrote the speaker of the house asking him to reappoint me on that committee and he said in that letter mr ieflin has always taken great interest in all matters pertaining to the development of the agricultural interests and he said further that my appointment would meet the hearty indorsement of the people of this entire section if i had been unfaithful on that committee could i have had such an indorsement as that president cameron of the farmers national congress wrote to the speaker of this house and asked him to reappoint me on the committee on agriculture and in that letter he said his services on that committee have been satisfactory and your reappointment of him will be agreeable to our agricultural interests if i had been unfaithful on that committee could i have received such an indorsement as that hon champ clark minority leader wrote me that if he were allowed to name the democrats on the committees as had been the custom heretofore it would give him pleasure to put me back on the committee on agriculture and i informed the speaker of mr clarks wishes so i have the proud consolation of feeling and knowing that the speaker of this house did not refuse to reappoint me because i had been derelict in my duty or unfaithful to the farming interests of my country but because of my advocacy of certain right principles and my activity in the interest of certain laws that would help the farmer here is what the newspapers said at the time he undertook to punish me for doing what i knew was right one of the most glaring punishments in mr cannons list is the removal of heflin of alabama from the committee on agriculture the alabama delegation is pretty angry over this reported action of the speaker mr helivn was indorsed for this place on the agricultural committee by the national farmers congress the national farmers union and the southern cotton association the removal of hlnrlne is believed to have been due to the fact that some time ago he was the leading spirit in a movement against grain and cotton speculation in doing my duty by the agricultural interests i had antagonized certain interests that did not want me to go back upon that committee and it is very evident that their wishes prevailed with the speaker the speaker never even intimated that there was objection to me from any source in depriving me of the power that i had and was using on that committee in the interest of the farmer the speaker was serving the enemies of agriculture so the paper says and in refusing to reappoint me he disregarded the wishes and recommendations of the three greatest farmers organizations in the united states while the speaker can pack committees and remove members who think for themselves and have the courage to refuse to do his bidding i thank god that we still have the right to speak our convictions on this floor and exercising that right today i am giving the truth of the situation to this house and to the country if the changes in the rules of the house continue to be made taking power from the house and conferring it on the speaker the day will come if the republicans remain in power when no member will be permitted to criticise the speakers conduct and then we will be unable to get the truth of conditions as they exist here to the country but the people are waking up and the evils of cannonisin are becoming known to the country and i am proud of this fact that the editor of one of the magazines that has done so much to educate the people on the tyranny mid arbirary action of the speaker wrote me a letter that my speech discussing the speakers way of suppressing legislation was a distinct contribution to the literature of the country against cannonisin i am not the only man that the speaker has removed or failed to reappoint on the committee on agriculture i have in mind now particularly a gentleman who incurred the displeaslure of the speaker in the fiftyninth congress the gentleman from mississippi no man since i have been in congress has been more untiring in his efforts to materially aid the agricultural interests of the south than the gentlenian from mississippi wherever the interest of the farmer could be found there could the gentleman from mississippi be found also the speaker refused to reappoint the gentleman on that committee in the sixtieth congress and no other reason can be found except the devotion of the gentleman from mississippi to the interest of agriculture the faithful discharge of his duty to the agricultural interests when i was a member of the committee on agriculture and had secured a unanimous report on my bill to prevent the selling or giving away of statistics regarding cotton on the 25th day of may 1008 i requested unanimous consent to call up the bill and put it on its passage and the record of may 25 shows that this is what happened"], [0.015781760215759277, 0.9842182397842407, 1, "the bill before the house as reported by the majority members of the ways and means committee calls for an estimated annual collection from the pockets of the people of the enormous sum of 326 724 732 its magnitude and farreaching effects demand that we should consider it carefully and dispassionately from a business standpoint from statements made here by members of that committee it is manifest that only those who have an ax to grind have been heard in the makeup of this bill ample time should be afforded the great masses of consumers to be heard from before its passage undue haste would be wrong i am not the least surprised that the special interests having succeeded in obtaining a bill to their taste are now busy creating a sentiment for its immediate passage if this bill did not serve the purposes of the special interests there would be an increasing cry for extended discussion from the very nature of the situation the 85 000 000 ultimate consumers who are affected by it or any considerable per cent thereof could not appear before the committee at its hearings the only possible way for them to be heard is through their representatives who have the courage to voice their contentions and to that end i for one protest against inordinate haste in the passage of this bill at the very beginning let it be remembered that the expense of running the government for the past twelve years amounts to 8 122 508 367 almost twice the sum required for the same purpose for the twelve years next preceding july 1 1897 the first session of the sixtieth congress and since the panic of 1907 appropriated 1 008 884 884 to be expended during the fiscal year 1909 the revenue of the government for that fiscal year was over 35 000 000 less than the appropriations the appropriations for the fiscal year 1910 amount to 1 044 014 295 and the revenues for this are now over 90 000 000 short with three months of the fiscal year 1909 remaining so that it can be seen at once that if this bill comes up to the full ineasure of its proponents expectations there will still remain to be raised by taxation from other sources the sum of 717 289 565 with a prospective estimated deficit of 140 000 000 instead of the panic serving as a signal to slow down and take the situation under control you have thrown the throttle wide open and as a result you are in the ditch while it does not come within the official scope of congress to take cognizance of municipal county and state taxes which in every instance are at the highest limit with in many instances their bonded indebtedness strained i insist that it is proper for the members of this body to bear in mind that the burdens being placed upon the people in the way of taxation are intolerable and must be lightened it may be well in this connection to bear in mind that the bonded indebtedness of the federal government has increased since july 1 1897 to march 16 1909 from 847 365 130 to 913 317 490 and that the total amount of interest paid o1 the outstanding interestbearing debt of the government during the period just stated amounts to 343 058 701 the striking feature of the two sessions of congress in which i have had the honor to sit has been the prodigal and lavish expenditure of the public funds the record will disclose the fact that i have consistently opposed this course by my votes the republican party claiming to be a party of constructive legislation has done little if anything during the last two years other than to make the most extravagant appropriations you are preeminently a party of spenders and your whole aim in the passage of this bill is to collect more taxes off the people that you may still further increase appropriations whenever any effort is made to check your untoward course in this particular your invariable response is that this is a billiondollar country as well might the individual spendthrift undertake to justify his course by saying that he has the wealth to squander that there is and has been for a number of years an alarming annual waste of many millions of dollars due to duplicate appropriations and unbusinesslike methods and a general allround leakage is admitted by the belated effort to constitute a committee to supervise appropriations instead of curtailing expenses stopping these duplicates and leaks you are casting about to find additional sources from which to derive more revenue as is evidenced by the inheritancetax feature of this bill this is a method of raising taxes that has been resorted to by many of the states for raising revenue for state purposes and it is manifestly unjust to these states that have been compelled to resort to this method for the federal governmnent to forestall this right for the legislative bodies of these states will be compelled to repeal their laws since they are closer to the people who will rebel against this double taxation the vice of this proposition is in creating a condition by extravagance where it becomes necessary to find new sources of revenue without eliminating some of the present sources of taxation following the panic of october 1907 the business of the country has fallen to lower and lower levels during each month succeeding that date yet in the face of these admitted conditions congress by the policy and action of the majority party has permitted appropriations to increase till it staggers the mind to contemplate their stupendous proportions mr clark the minority leader in his discussion of this bill on the floor of the house made this statement the tariff is a tax the tariff is a tax paid by the consumer nobody with any reputation for veracity or intelligence to lose will deny either of these two propositions if lie does deny them he will be confounded by the evidence of high protective advocates contained in the hearings before the committee on ways and means which hearings are made up almost exclusively of the evidence of such advocates no one on that side to this date has challenged this statement or can do so successfully so that it must follow that the 326 724 732 to be raised by this bill is a tax that must be paid by the consumer the right to tax is the right to destroy and by taxation you have exercised wellnigh to the limit this right to destroy the property of the people all efforts on this side to check or curb the placing of this intolerable burden upon the people is met with derision and sneers the businesslike procedure under such circumstances would be to reduce expenditures to at least meet existing revenue not to increase taxation for more lavish expenditures efforts looking to economy are made sport of at the present time no one can contend that business is increasing in such volume for that is the usual plea of the extravagant as to demand additional expenditures to meet expanding conditions at such seasons as this it is imperative that the government like individuals live within its income the chairman of the committee extolled the dingley bill as a revenue producer conveying the impression to the country that by it the spanishamerican war was financed tie controlling idea of the proponents of the bill is not to lighten the burdens of the people but to raise additional revenue with which to meet additional and incveased appropriations the chairman stating in his opening speech that tthe time had come to hunt for more revenue in a tariff bill economy is an unknown quantity oil that side of the house anybody can spend money but it is al evidence of wisdon to save it nor do i expect to see a return of a period of prosperity until the legislative bodies controlling the commercial nations of the world realizing this fact act accordingly for and i repeat it with emphasis national as individual prosperity rests primarily upon the same underlying principle the estimated annual revenues from custom duties to be raised by this bill show ain increase over th6 dingley bill of 11 666 748 this together with the 20 000 000 from inheritance taxes and 1 500 000 additional internal revenue represents an estimated annual increase in the amount of taxes to be collected from the people of 33 166 748 in all you propose to collect under this bill by way of taxation from the people 326 724 732 39 and at a time when the country is still suffering from severe business depression and as against 293 557 984 14 collected in 1906 when the country was at its high tide of prosperity and yet there are gentlemen here on this floor in the face of these indisputable facts claiming that this bill is a revision downward neither the facts nor the figures warrant this statement if it were true we would be in the ridiculous attitude of undertaking to meet a daily increasing deficit with a daily decreasing revenue at what point pray do you expect these two diverging conditions to meet and strike a balance the apologists for this bill claim to have recently discovered that some of the rates of the dingley bill are and have been prohibitive yet you have inserted prohibitive rates in many instances in this bill in spite of your additional contention that reduced rates increase revenue and that you must have and are hunting for more revenue again if you have full confidence in your prophecy that the passage of this bill means the return of vanished prosperity why in addition to taxing inheritances do you provide for 50 000 000 panama bonds to refund a liquidated charge and in addition make provision to increase the amount of certificates of indebtedness from 100 000 000 to 250 000 000 and this in the face of the fact that the average or equivalent ad valorem rates of taxation in this bill are higher than the rates in the bill which this extraordinary session of congress was called to revise and as the country understood it to revise downward to my mind these are distress signals for the approaching financial storm that you expect to break in fury over the commercial business of this country following this bills enactment into law you have made provision in said bill to issue interestbearing obligations of the government equal to almost twothirds of the revenue that you claim this bill will raise so that it might well be termed a bill to increase the bonded indebtedness of the country instead of a bill to raise revenue this function of the bill will be used to its full extent if it shall result as i expect it to that the expenses of the government for the next twelve years shall as they have in the past twelve years redouble the republicans have with amazing effrontery but with their accustomed inconsistency claimed that every blessingncludlng i presume increased cost of livingthat humanity has enjoyed since july 1897 when the dingley bill became effective has resulted from the provisions of that bill in the first instance if true why repeal it mr dalzell speaking of that measure in addressing this house during the first session of the sixtieth congress after rehearsing the wonderful strides this country had made along commercial lines added and yet notwithstanding this wonderful prosperity which if not contributed to by is at least coincident with our existing tariff lawsand so forth later in his efforts to account for the panic that was then on he said the most remarkable thing about the whole situation is the suddenness with which it passed has it passed if so when this dingley bill panacea for all previous business disordersthis bill that you claim rekindled the fires in the furnaces started the wheels of prosperity to revolvingis to be repealed and succeeded by a bill that a washington post correspondent on march 24 1909 styles a bill to kill business over an article bearing a new york date line and written by an economic expert and which is in full as follows"], [0.023515403270721436, 0.9764845967292786, 1, "i am coming to that waste waste waste everywhere waste that is shocking waste that is sickening on february 15 1905 in this house i said it seems to me that in many respects at least the simplicity of the past is gone our government today pays as much attention to ceremony as much regard for pomp and display as much deference to power as any government in the world to flatter the pride and tickle the vanity of our president the ships of our navy are gathered together upon our eastern coast and pass in stately parade before him greeting him with a royal salute at an estimated cost to our people of 150 000 you see about this city today preparations being made for inducting into the office of president him who is already president and on inauguration day these streets will echo with the tread of infantry the clatter of cavalry the rumble of artillery flags will flutter swords will flash bands will play and cannon will roar making an occasion as gorgeous in display as would mark the crowning of any monarch of the old world the simplicity of the olden time is gone the economy of the fathers is no longer practiced i do not believe i overstate the case when i say that we have today the most extravagant government the world ever saw compare our expenditures with that of other nations russia spends more than we but russia is a despotism threatened by anarchy and despised by the world great britain on a peace footing annually spends less than we despite the fact that she maintains a navy as great as that of any two other powers and has colonial possessions scattered throughout the world fifty times as great as ours and in addition pys as interest upon her national debt 100 000 000 more than we pay upon ours germany with her great military establishment of 600 000 men so cursed with militarism that her people have fled to this land by the million seeking here a refuge spends annually 200 000 000 less than the united states france has been swept by revolution and has waged bloody wars of conquest and from these has inherited a public debt upon which she pays annually five times as much interest as we pay upon ours she maintains a standing army eight times as great as ours and at the present time has a navy second only to that of great britain and yet we spend annually 100 000 000 more than france the people of this country will after a while want to know the reason for this extraordinary conditiona bankrupt treasury when revenues are abundant and the country prosperousand sooner or later they will come to know the truth that you gentlemen on the other side are spending the substance of the peoople in aping the vices and mimicking the follies of the monarchies of the old world i thank god that i can go back to my people and look into their honest faces and say to them that i have never aided in fastening this wicked extravagance upon them if we have a democratic house next time as we hope and expect its energies should be devoted to cleaning house here in washington and throughout the entire country and the people relieved of this burden the president has said that 100 000 000 should be saved annually the leader of the senate has said that if this government could be run as a business man would conduct his business 300 000 100 could be saved each year with such a record and with such admissions is it any wonder that the republican party did not make any professions toward economy and did not have the hardihood to condemn extravagance the republican platform contained no acknowledgment that this house had ceased to be a deliberative body no criticisd of the arbitrary power of the speaker no demand for the reform of its rules they could not have done so without speaking their own condemnation for back of every exercise of arbitrary power of the speaker back of every insolent assumption of authority back of every wicked attempt to suppress free speech back of every devilish device invented by the old committee on rules to control this house to make its membership grovel at the feet of the speaker stood the republican majority indorsing applauding approving mr cannon was elected speaker at the beginning of the fiftyeighth congress at that time and at the opening of the fiftyninth and sixtieth congresses democrats begged for a change in the house rules democrats warned you that you were degrading this house robbing it of its power to intellgently legislate creating an oligarchy that would betray the people and defy their will but you would not listen in 1908 i said here the truth is that we in the house are in a state of double slaveryslavery to the speaker and to the committee on rules no democrat voted to adopt these rules in any one of these three congresses and no republican voted against them it was the democratic platform of 190s that denounced these rules and made cannonism one of the issues of the campaign and focused the attention of the country upon the iniquities prevailing here cannonism became a word of odium throughout the country and the sentiment of the country became feebly reflected on the other side and insurgency was born in the dying days of the sixtieth congress to avert if possible the gathering storm the republican leaders were driven to change the rules for which they had vouched and voted but it remained for the sixtyfirst congress to witness the old guard of republicanism hitherto dominant and defiant hitherto arrogant and audacious cringe and cower before the allied forces of democracy and insurgency and finally go down in inglorious defeat the doom of cannonism and czarism of aldrichism and bossism has been sounded as a result of this contest and the betrayal of the people in so many other ways the republican party has been dismembered like gaul of old it is now divided into three partsregular republicans insurgent republicans and chameleon republicans the regular republicans ride the elephant all the time the insurgent republicans ride some and walk some occasionally giving the poor old beast a savage kick but always taking care to hold on to the tail as an evidence of their allegiance the chameleon republicans walk with the insurgents when it is popular and ride with the regulars when it is profitable the regulars have audacity the insurgents sincerity and the chameleons prudence the regulars believe it is always better to be regular than right the insurgents think it is sometimes better to be right than regular the regulars always love their party best the insurgents sometimes love their country best the regulars say that the insurgents have betrayed their party the insurgents say that the regulars have betrayed the people i am disposed to believe most that they say about each other because they know each other far better than i know either i must say though that my sympathies are largely with the insurgents they are in a predicament they are entirely too good to be republicans and entirely too bad to be democrats i look upon them as convicted republicansi do not mean legally convicted but religiously convictedand they need only an oldfashioned conversion to make democrats out of them but neither regular nor insurgent can claim that there has been a redemption of the platform pledges of their party up to this time the most they can now show is a bureau of mines which few opposed and a tariff bill which nobody defends most of their platform pledges are ready for the smithsonian to go side by side with the other dead things sent over by mr roosevelt but they did pass the paynealdrich bill and such a bill it was it was the payne bill in the house the aldrich bill in the senate and the trust bill in both places it was conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquityconceived in the house and brought forth in the senate if moved by courtesy one should be tempted to say that the house bill was better than the senate bill he is reminded that under the rules a member here can not speak disrespectfully of the other body the president said in new york nothing was expressly said in the platform that this revision was to be a downward revision the same statement has been made elsewhere by leading republicans we made this charge against you in the last campaign but you sanctimoniously rolled your eyes toward heaven and held up your hands in horror at the suggestion and cried out that revision meant reduction there is no need to tell the people now that revision did not mean reduction they have learned through bitter experience that while all reductions are revisions all revisions are not reductions they know now that one genuine tariff reduction is worth a hundred fake tariff revisions the trouble with the republican party is that it frequently pretends but rarely intends if it could conduct a business with its pretensions as its assets and its intentions as its liabilities its dividends would put the steel trust to shame the president did say in his new york speech that the platform was a promise for downward revision by implication that is just the kind of downward revision the country gota reduction by implication the country has had an opportunity to learn anew the lesson that the republican party can promise like spendthrifts but that they perform like misers but the president said at winonawhat a mellow sound that word has wlnona winona that was the first frost line on the arctic trip the president took through the insurgent territory last year defending the tariff bill when the warmth of his reception was measured by the lepgth of the iciclesthe president said at winona just before he poured on the head of the chairman of the appropriations committee the anointing oil that on the whole however i am bound to say that i think that the payne tariff bill is the best tariff bill that the republican party ever passed in answer the consumer can well say in the hole however i am bound to say that the payne tariff bill is the worst tariff bill any party ever passed the president said that it was the best tariff bill ever passed by republicans that statement does not so much pay tribute to this bill as it reflects upon preceding ones but is it a good tariff bill it was so bad that about 20 republicans in this house voted against the passage of the bill as it came from conference it was so bad that 7 republican senators voted against it it was so bad that the president justifies his failure to veto on the ground of party solidarity it was so bad that a republican state convention in indiana did not let its name be mentioned in its platform it was so bad that almost every great newspaper and magazine throughout the country has denounced its iniquities it was so bad that the versatile gentleman from illinois could not find one single new years hallelujah that contained a word of praise for it it was so bad that it can not be successfully defended before the people of any part of this country it was tried in missouri you know the result it was tried in massachusetts you know the result it was tried in new york you know the result in view of these results and as an evidence of appreciation for your frankness in conceding the next house to uswhich most of you would do privatelylet me suggest that if you want to retain control of this house for the rest of this congress it behooves you to look very carefully after your health during the summer vacation but is the payne bill a good bill just listen to what gifford pinchot says about it now and tremble over what his friend roosevelt may say about it when he reaches home a week from now pinchot says the tariff under the policy of protection was originally a means to raise the rate of wages it has been made a tool to increase the cost of living the oot schedule professing to protect the woolgrower is found to result in sacrificing grower and consumer alike to one of the most rapacious of trusts the cottoncloth schedule was increased in the face of the uncontradicted public testimony of the manufacturers themselves that it ought to remain unchanged the steel trust interests by a trick secured an indefensible increase in the tariff on structural steel the sugar trust stole from the government like a petty thief yet congress by means of a dishonest schedule continues to protect it in bleeding the public at the very time the duties on manufactured rubber were raised the leader of the senate in company with the guggenheim syndicate was organizing an international rubber trust whose charter made it also a holding company for the coal and copper deposits of the whole world it seems to me that the gentleman from new york has become the rival of mr roosevelt as a hunter of big game roosevelt is filling the magazines with stories about killing african elephants while all the country is talking about how paynn has mortally wounded a republican elephant when i think about the payne bill it seems to me that the only way for you to justify your disappointment and betrayal of the american people is to commit the sacrilege of blaming the almighty by saying that while the people made you able to lift their burdens god did not make you willing to do it the country is beginning to know you better than you think you have been fertile in inventing catch phrases and specious appeals in the past in olden days you appealed to the generosity of the people in behalf of the infant industries it was successful until it became absurd you then told them that the tariff was not a tax they believed you for awhile you then admitted that it was a tax but you said the foreigner paid it you were driven from that you denied that it fostered the trusts until denials became useless you scorned the suggestion that your stallfed manufacturers were selling americanmade goods in foreign countries cheaper than to our own people until proof was piled upon proof mountain high you then said it was the surplus that was sold abroad and now you brazenly and impudently boast of it as one of the virtues of protection that the profits made at home permit you to sell abroad without profit you have invoked the sacred name of labor and claim that for labors sake you would continue this policy of plunder although you know that the trusts are permitted to eat the meat while labor is compelled to gnaw the bones you have attempted your conjurers tricks with the farmer by putting duties upon the products of the soil that are exported and sold in a world market and in a world competition while you have burdened him with a tax upon all that he buys you must know that you protect the farmer in name only but the manufacturer in fact you must know that to the farmer you give the shadow while to the manufacturer you are giving the substance you know that by legislative decree you can enrich the manufacturer but you know equally well that by no legislative legerdemain can you make the rains fall the sun shine or the earth produce for the farmers enrichment you know that you do not make for but take from the farmer it seems that the people would learn that the democratic idea is rightthat the tariff is a tax that it is paid by them the only legitimate purpose of which is to support an honest government honestly administered and that it should not be permitted to continue to be a system maintained by the government for the enrichment of a favored few the citizen regards the tariff tax as an evil because it takes money from his pocket while the manufacturer looks upon it as a blessing because it puts money into his pocket the citizen submits to it because of his patriotism while the manufacturer advocates it because of his greed the citizen would measure it by the necessities of the government while the manufacturer measures it by his own avarice the democratic idea is that whenever imposed it should yield revenue though it may or may not protect the republican idea is that it should be for protection though it may or may not yield revenue the republican idea is that the interests will be potent to save a party that has served them while the democratic idea is that the people will be omnipotent to destroy a party which has betrayed them the republican creed is toil and spoils toil for the masses and spoils for the classes the payne tariff bill has shown that the republicans are expert mathematicians that they can add subtract multiply and divide all in one operation they can add to the wealth of the rich subtract from the substance of the poor multiply millionaires and divide themselvesall in one bill but the payne tariff bill has also shown that the republicans are poor spellers all persons have appetites even during this period of high prices the people demanded that the tax be reduced upon the necessities that minister to and satisfy the human appetite the republicans responded to that demand by putting apatite a kind of stoneon the free list the savior must have had republicans in mind when he said or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone the world has changed some since his day upon earth in that day publicans and sinners meant two classes of undesirable citizens in this day and especially when we think of republican extravagance and of the payne bill we know that republicans and sinners mean the same thing"], [0.023681700229644775, 0.9763182997703552, 1, "the bill introduced during the first session of this congress by the gentleman from new york has for its purpose the reduction of the souths representation in the house it is to this proposed iniquitous measure that i wish to make reference and to enter an earnest protest knowing the membership of this house as i do and knowing that even though the republican party is decidedly in the majority i can not think that any legislation having as its object such an intolerable purpose as is openly expressed in this bill can or ever will be enacted into law regardless of political parties we are all men and i am sure we are not so devoid of reason or a sense of right as to ever seriously consider such firebrand legislation to which the people of the section against which it is aimed would not patiently submit and against which decency and justice would compel people of all sections regardless of creed or party to vigorously protest if this bill should become a law the representation in this house for the state of georgia would be reduced from 11 to 6 representatives this would be depriving that state of 5 of its representatives the reduction as proposed by this bill would reduce the representation of alabama from 9 to 5 arkansas from 7 to 5 florida from 3 to 2 louisiana from 7 to 4 mississippi from 8 to 3 north carolina from 10 to 7 south carolina from 7 to 3 tennessee from 10 to 8 and virginia from 10 to 7 if this proposed reduction was made it would mean that a total of 32 southern congressmen would lose their seats in this house and the 10 southern states just named would have their representation reduced from 82 to 50 members or a total loss of 32 representatives and for no other reason than these 10 sovereign states have dared to exercise their rights as guaranteed to every state of the union under the constitution these 10 southern states are to be chastised and the people thereof humiliated and trodden upon for doing what they bad an absolute right to do the gentleman from new york and the few who agree with him in this unjust measure hardly know the danger of the dynamite with which they are playing god forbid that men who are blind to justice empty of love for the white race and who disregard constitutional rights should ever get control of the congress of the united states for not until then will any state suffer humiliation because it dares to purify the ballot and morals in its borders by prescribing certain restrictions as to who shall be permitted to exercise the right of franchise and to control its government the constitution of the united states provides in section 2 article i that the electors for members of the house of representatives in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature representation in the house of representatives is not based upon the number of voters in a state but upon the population from time to time out of a fit of political desperation the country is called upon to witness the spasmodic efforts of some gentlemen on the other side of the chamber to destroy white supremacy in the south but while white men live in the south it will never be done these gentlemen who pretend that they would foist force bills and reduction of representation bills upon the southern states hardly mean it i can not believe they are sincere in it some of these gentlemen thank god there are not many of sthem and i hope the day is not far distant when none of them will be here insist that the negro be given in the south all kinds of equal rightspolitical social and otherwise if anyone thinks he can drive us to it he is mistaken and does not know the folks he is dealing with notwithstanding the fact that these gentlemen are insisting on these rights for the negro in the south yet they always see to it that he is not appointed to any federal office in the north and that he is not elected in the north to any of the important offices z just remember one thing my friends that for the very reason you do not want him in office over you and in power over you is the same reason that white people in the south will not tolerate it people of the same race of the same blood are pretty much the same in spirit and in sentiment wherever you find them and i can not believe that the white people in the districts represented by gentlemen claiming such rights for the negro approve of the conduct of their representatives in this regard this bill to almost deprive the southern states of representation here in the house of our fathers is the latest exhibition of longdistance brotherly love for the negro and it is about the worst bill of its kind that has ever been aimed at the south the gentleman from new york would destroy at one stroke all the rights of the southern states to regulate their own elections and place them in the position of elective serfs at the feet of tyrannical legislation born of bitterness hate and political selfishness the membership of the house under the enforcement of this proposed legislation would be reduced from 391 to 359 members the reductions would be made in states having democratic delegations and if made drunk with power and crazed with the crime committed would not these southhating gentlemen then use the increased majority resulting to them by reason of this reduction undertake and accomplish even more shameful acts against states that would then be almost entirely in their power and at their mercy the gentleman from new york out of a pretended spirit of fairness that is hard to account for very kindly adds to this firebrand bill of his a proviso that when the dismantled southern states shall repent of their desire to govern themselves and shall conduct their elections in entire accordance with the specifications of certain designing republican politicians they may again have their full share of representation to which they are entitled i wish to suggest that such is a pretty big concession to be made by democratic states and i hope the gentleman from new york will hold his breath until such is acceded to by us he further provides in this obnoxious bill of his that unless the legislatures of the specified states shall make provision for elections in accordance with this new plan all the representatives generously allowed them shall be elected from the states at large the author of this bill is a serious man and in no sense a humorist otherwise we might conclude that he was trying to add to the gayety of nations and vary the monotony of congress does the gentleman from new york really mean what he says in this bill of his would he as a man of the white race the purest and noblest race known to history be a party to a fiendish scheme that would place black heels on white necks in the south oh my friends i am afraid the gentleman has never broadened up enough to realize that there is even a part of the world other than the state of new york through this foul proposition he would reestablish the dark days of reconstruction would demolish the supremacy of the descendants of the noblest race of men that ever walked the globe and put in its place a blistering government of mongrel type in which the negro would hold the balance of power sir i deeply and sincerely regret all political movements of this character they tend to reopen old sectional wounds which we of the present generation are striving to forget it is a fatal mistake to inject into the present era of good feeling between the sections anything tending to keep alive the enmities engendered by the war as a son of a private confederate soldier who fought his best as long as the war lasted and turned his sword into a plowshare when the war had closed and has nobly done his duty as he saw it i revere next to heaven itself the sacred cause of the south i honor as i honor nothing else on earth the memories of our southern ancestors but i fully realize nevertheless tiat no good result can come from perpetuating any of the bitterness of the past and that the sooner sectional animosities are entirely forgotten the better will be the fate of every portion of our united country i am sure i speak the sentiment of the southern people when i declare that they would be most grateful if the gentleman from new york and those who agree with him and seek distinction through bills such as he stands sponsor for would leave them alone to settle the race question and all other local problems that confront them the southern people are honest courageous noble in every particular and though they lost practically everything they had in the bitter conflict of the sixties they have put aside all that and have met and overcome misfortune in a manner that established a new record in the world they thank god that power has been given them to so splendidly rebuild our fair country that they have been endowed with wisdom and courage to meet and master all local problems including the race question and they only ask to be let alone that they may work out the solution of this vexatious problem so vital to our moral political and social institutions it is most deeply to be regretted that legislation such as that proposed in this bill has the backing of a single member i believe that every fairminded person every one of evenly balanced judgment every one who can correctly gauge cause and effect every broadminded patriot would grieve to see such an enactment it would set back for scores of years the hands on the dial of southern progress it would bring about the reinstatement of the social and political chaos that reigned in the south when the ballot was polluted by the republican bayonet it would rekindle all the fires of racial prejudice which are now almost extinguished it would cause constant and horrible clashes between the negro and the white race in the south it would again plunge into the abyss of despair the fairest hopes of peace and harmony between the sections i am happy to say that the wounds from which the south bled after four years of strife followed by other years of suffering have so well closed that nearly all the scars have faded the indescribably horrible rule of the reconstruction era was happily succeeded by safe and sane legislation in the interest of civic order and the revival of industry and commerce capital which had shunned territory where investment had been considered hazardous came rushing to the south as soon as it was clearly shown that her true sons had resumed their sway and that law and order were in command industry unfolded her potent wings and gave employment to thousands the husbandmans plow again furrowed the grateful earth which yielded abundant harvest the south started on that career of recuperation which has become the wonder of all the world and she now holds out promise of a future in comparison with which the prosperity of bygone years will fade into pale insignificance i into this state of peace and order republican politicians selfish for their own advancement would throw the apple of discord for let me tell you sir horrible discord and confusion worse confounded would result from the passage of this bill the population of the southern states is about 25 000 000 of these about 9 000 000 or 30 per cent are negroes if the illiterate and purchasable negroes were allowed to vote they would become facile tools in the hands of designing politicians the rule of this unholy combination will never again be permitted i protest against this attempt at discord my people the southern white people as a whole have done their full duty by the negro they have done more than ought to have been expected of them they have heavily taxed themselves for his education they have given him every opportunity to earn a respectable livelihood they have given him justice in the courts they are gladly giving him aid along his journey toward selfrespect and selfreliance the negro in the south has all the rights of citizenship save only that of suffrage and he has that except as it is denied to all under qualifications set forth in the law of certain states the anglosaxon is the only race that has thus far successfully solved the great problem of selfgovernment for this great task that race had centuries of preparation from magua charta to the declaration of independence much precious blood was shed to establish government by the people from the foundation of our government down to the present day the people have settled every question that presented itself and today this country is the most shining example in all the world of a wellbalanced wellestablished democratic republic in our whole national existence there is but one periodthe reconstruction erawhen the negro was injected into our career as a controlling factor i want to partially rehearse the story of this era with the hope that its rehearsal will prove an antidote to the poison contained in this bill and other bills like it and a preventive against such vicious legislation in the future when lee laid down his sword at appomattox and grant bade the confederate soldiers to take their horses home for use in the spring plowing the hearts of the southern people were filled with gratitude to the generous northern chieftain those soldiers went home to rebuild their shattered homesteads and again make fruitful the fields laid waste by war all was going well when like a thunderbolt from a clear sky came the reconstruction acts of 1867 and a blight fell upon the land four million ignorant negroes from whom the gyves of bondage had just been struckas ignorant of government as their ancestors in africawere invested with the right of suffrage and the intelligent white people of the south were excluded from the public councils every southern state was put under miilitary rule and soldiers were made the judges of the qualifications of voters negroes were election officers negroes controlled the constitutional conventions directed by carpetbaggers and scalawags who were worse than negroes fraud theft rapine and murder were the order of the day those acts of march 2 march 23 and july 19 1867 plunged the southern states into misery on which the plunderers feasted and fattened under these laws the negroes and their allies obtained control of every one of the reconstructed states except virginia and west virginia the negroes were angels by comparison with their allies southern men know full well that the negroes of those wretched years were but the tools of the designing hordes of plunderers who plied their iniquitous trades under the egis of governmental protection as a lesson and as a warning to those who would inflict force bills upon the south let me mention a few suggestive facts of past history under these iniquitous reconstruction election laws in alabama there was a heavy penalty imposed upon anyone who challenged a vote in south carolina the commissioners of election carpetbaggers could fix the places of election at any time even on the day of election and could keep the ballot boxes ten days after the election before declaring the result in georgia no registration was required no challenges were allowed and there was the fullest opportunity to repeat in arkansas the courts were forbidden by law to interfere with the partisan appointees who conducted the election in louisiana the governor appointed the registrars the registrars appointed the supervisors who were not required to live in the parish where they served and in fact many of them went from new orleans to serve in parishes where they had never set foot before and sometimes returned themselves elected to office these are but a few illustrations of those horrible laws legislative bodies in the south composed of men who were not taxpayers and many of whom could not read or write robbed their states of credit abroad while they plundered the citizens at home in south carolina alone there were 200 trial justices who could not write as a result of this reign of ignorance and crime there were in the fortyfirst congress for instance from march 4 1871 to march 4 1873 from the 12 southern states 22 republican and 2 democratic united states senators and 48 republican and 13 democratic representatives as further enlightenment as to the legacies left by the selfish political gluttons of that era in alabama the state debt in six years was increased 17 000 000 in north carolina in three years the state debt was increased 24 000 000 while the assessed valuation of taxable properties was only 120 000 000 and 14 000 000 were issued in bonds for railroads not one of which was ever built in south carolina after the state debt had become so big that even the carpetbaggers repudiated part of it that state threw off the yoke before they had a chance to make a fresh start but was still left with a debt of 6 000 000 in one year 1872 the printing expenses of south carolina ran up to 450 000 which was a great deal more than the similar expenses for twentyfive years previous to reconstruction during the two years administration of governor bullock in georgia the state debt was increased by 6 623 000 and bonds were issued amounting to nearly 6 000 000 floridas debt was increased 1 000 000 besides a bond issue of 4 000 000 in tennessee a bonded debt was created of more than 16 000 000 in arkansas in the six years between 1s68 and 1874 the average annual expenses of the state government exclusive of schools and public buildings were four times as much as in the succeeding six years of democratic administration in mississippi the debt ran up in six years from practically nothing to several millions the tax rate in 1871 was four times as high as under democratic r~gime in 1873 eight and half times in 1874 fourteen times as high and 64 000 000 acres of land onefifth the area of the state were forfeited for taxes at the beginning of the reconstruction era texas had scarcely any state debt but after four years of carpetbag rule she owed about 4 500 000 when the carpetbaggers took possession of louisiana the state tax was 31 mills on the dollar but by 1872 it was 21 mills and the state debt had jumped in that time from 8 700 000 to 48 000 000 facts like these could be continued almost indefinitely as to these conditions let me call to witness a distinguished massachusetts republican member of the massachusetts historical society a historian of international repute dr james ford rhodes in his history of the united states published in 1906 doctor rhodes says no large policy in our country has ever been so conspicuous a failure as that of forcing universal negro suffrage upon the south the scheme of reconstruction pandered to the ignorant negroes the knavish white natives and the vulturous adventurers who flocked from the north intelligence and property stood bound and helpless under negro carpetbag rule and the fact that such governments continued to exist were supported by federal authority and defended by prominent republicans has a share in the demoralization of politics at the north again says this fairminded republican in the same volume the negros political activity is rarely of a nature to identify him with any movement on a high plane he takes no part in civil service or tariff reform he was not a factor in the contest for honest money he is seldom if ever heard in advocacy of pure municipal government and for him goodgovernment associations have no attraction he is greedy for office and emolument it is for this reason that he arrogantly asserts his right to recognition and he has had remarkable success in securing offices under the federal government in a word he has been politically a failure and he could not have been otherwise in spite of all the warnings of science and of political experience he was started at the top and as is the fate of most such unfortunates ho fell to the bottom rhodess history of the united states vol 7 p 168 et seq the only rights that the negro has received that have been worth anything to him have been accorded him in the south a bulletin recently issued by the bureau of education states that it is estimated that at the present time about 30 per cent of the publicschool funds in the south is for the support of the schools for negroes and remember that practically all of this fund comes from the taxation of whites according to the same publication at least 165 000 000 has been expended by the southern states since 1870 to support common schools for the colored race within the lines of demarcation prescribed by social rules the negro in the south is absolutely untrammeled we will not give him social equality we will not allow him political supremacy we will help him through any other channels to the best advancement of which he is capable the negro would not be so terribly anxious to vote if he were not encouraged so to do by these periodic force bills in congress and the foolish false doctrines of scheming republican politicians real students of the situation either north or south know this in the political science quarterly for march 1905 francis gordon caffey in an article entitled suffrage limitations at the south declares that it is a mistaken assumption of fact to say that in temper the negroes as a body are anxious to vote in comparing the election laws of the south and new england mr caffey further says the policy of rewarding those who learn to read and write by giving them a vote has been permitted to remain in operation in new england for many years as an influence tending to reduce illiteracy now when the south still so far away from victory in the great war it is making against illiteracy offers the same premium to her citizens as new england has long and with profit offered it is proposed either to punish her by loss of influence in congress and in the electoral college or to force her in order to retain her proportionate representation to restore to ignorance the ljolitical power which she desires to offer as a premium upon intelligence and this alternative is to be imposed upon her because in order to establish an educational qualification it was necessary for her as it was necessary in 1857 for massachusetts to preserve the rights of those illiterate persons who already had the suffrage this able writer was discussing the force bill presented by the gentleman from indiana who seems to have realized the folly of it and hence has abandoned it but what he says is equally applicable to the bill of the gentleman from new york the real object of all such bills is to reinstate negro supremacy in the southern states and perpetuate the domination of the republican party in congress no one thinks for a moment that the republican party is animated by altruistic sentiment or that it aims at abstract political justice the late thomas b reed on one occasion with a cynicism so frank as to be almost pleasing declared that the republican party was perfectly willing to let the southern states do as they pleased in the regulation of their affairs but that it wanted the votes that belong to us in the house of representatives these politicians do not care a rap for the rights of the negro politically or otherwise but they want to use him as a means unto an end in their own political life there is absolutely nothing but unadulterated demagogism in all this agitation in favor of force bills the time for such legislation if it ever existed is long past they that urge it are far behind the age they have failed to learn the lesson of the last three decades to them the renaissance of the south is a sealed book the godspeed heard on every side to cheer on the south in its new career of prominence in the nation finds them deaf to its call but measures such as they propose will not avail against the calm determination of the southern people to work out their glorious destiny unhampered and unchecked by such influences conscious of her might the south will move forward in her civic life she is thoroughly alive to her great opportunities and advantages she knows her superiority in coast line and navigable rivers in the distribution of rainfall in soil and climate in agricultural possibilities in quantity and variety of minerals and most of all in her splendid contribution to the dominant race of the world dealing fairly honestly and liberally with all men she will not forget where her rights are or how to maintain them but she will press ever forward toward the mark of her high calling in the perfection and fulfillment of her own destiny and in the betterment of all mankind"], [0.030277252197265625, 0.9697227478027344, 1, "yes i was robbed on a small house costing only a few thousand dollars there is another peculiar thing about these poor little lumber manufacturers and dealers in my section when the panic struck them threefourths of them discharged all their laborers turned them out to starve sent them back to the farms and other employments yet during the entire panic as before stated no one ever observed any reduction in the price of their product the manufacturers say this was true on account of the retailers and the retailers unloaded it upon the manufacturers i do not know which was to blame but i do know that they starved their laborers and still robbed the people to unload this evil on the retailers by the manufacturers is altogether inexcusable for the latter can at any time put the retailers out of business by simply refusing to patronize themby establishing lumber yards and selling directly to the consumers themselves but more about the lumber trust in mississippi at the 1906 session of the mississippi legislature after an investigation a resolution was adopted directing the attorneygeneral of the state to institute legal proceedings under the criminal statutes of the state against the lumber trust proceedings were instituted against the mississippilouisiana retail lumber dealers association which is now pending in the supreme court a recent issue of the jackson daily news says it is expected that some time during the present month special justice w r harper will prepare the opinion of the court in the case of the state v the mississippllouisiana retail lumber dealers association better known as the antitrust lumber case also it has been our understanding that the facts collected by the state agent were forwarded to the federal authorities for prosecution under the sherman antitrust law but this was the last ever heard of the prosecution the papers were pigeonholed in the department of justice i can not state whether there was ever an attempt at an investigation by the federal authorities nor have we ever seen any reason given for this silence except that contained in an article appearing in the washington post on june 24 1907 having been first sent from this city by a correspondent of the new york world it is too long for me to attempt to now read but will insert it in the record do not forget to peruse it for it is a vigorous disclosure of a villainous scheme to shield the trusts for selfish political advantages in nominating the last republican presidenta washington special to the world says in offering the internalrevenue commissionership appointment to pearl wight the ships chandler of new orleans president roosevelt laid the foundation for a very fine politicofinancial bargainfine for himself in a political sense and fine for wight in a business way the president will get the delegates from louisiana and mississippi as the outcome of the arrangement wights friends and business associates will get nice large juicy contracts and orders for isthmian canal supplies and always have a friend at court to look after their interests in the event any inspector person either in louisiana or mississippi or on the isthmus undertake any hypercritical work the ship chandlery firm of woodward wight co on canal street new orleans has had hundreds of contracts and orders for the panama canal supplies from the canal commission the lighthouse board the mint and the postoffice woodward the postmaster of new orleans was a member of the firm when he went into office his name is still used as a part of the firm designation that however is by special arrangement with wight who is his brotherinlaw the camp hinton company

it sent to the canal zone the inspectors there held them up it required considerable of wights time to straighten it out but it was straightened out and the government used the ties this combination is not advertised from the house tops of new orleans but members of the lumbermens exchange in that city talk about it and guess that it is a good thing to be in politics and the lumber business at the same time some of them get contracts but the good ones go to the members of the combination when bids for the contract let a short time ago were opened it was found that the camp hinton company had submitted the lowest formal bid the gossip in new orleans in the trade was that a tip had gone out that the commission was going to insist upon the letter of the specification for sizes then the wonder was as to whether the company from which wight said he is withdrawing got advice on the subject that enabled it to make its precisely correct bid the lowest of course that was merely speculation among the lumbermen who did not get in on the good thing the political enemies of wight and williams believe that they are the central figures in many of the companies up state and that they are using the political power placed in their hands by the administration to further their financial interests they believe that while wight williams and the rest of the lilywhite organization stand on the front gallery new orleans idiom for veranda proclaiming their support of the president and his policy their employees are in the back office plotting the combinations in restraint of

the antitrust statute the question as to whether it does has been presented to the department of justice the papers and facts are all contained in a neat presentation of the subject but they are in a pigeonhole accumulating dust attorneygeneral bonaparte is too busy making speeches on civilservce reform the impertinence of the newspapers and writing funny dissertations on what is whisky to

association wight and williams were prominent in it c w robinson of the c w robinson company was the chief figure in the mississippi end of the association the legislature of mississippi early in 1906

speaking along this line mr franklin pierce in his recent valuable book on the tariff and the trusts says there has scarcely been a case since 1864 where the domestic product was protected that the amount of the duty imposed was not actually more than the whole labor cost again he says every particle of clothing on your body from the boots on your feet to the hat upon your head without one single exception costs you from 50 to 150 per cent more than it would without the tariff the trust sits by your fire and your table taxes every piece of glass cutlery and pottery in your house makes yot pay tribute upon every piece of wool cotton and furniture in your home and robs you steadily day in and day out by its excessive prices remember that this increased price does not go to sustain the government more than nineteentwentletbs of it goes at last into the treasury of the trust also along this line i would like to read an extract from the progressive farmer here are the two great evils which it is almost impossible to prevent creeping into any tariff policy 1 the tariff tax being collected without the consumers knowledge is allowed to become excessive and extravagance in government results does anyone believe as the writer wisely asks that one pension bill would ever have reached 50 000 000 much less 160 000 000 if the money had to be collected by direct levies through sheriffs and tax collectors 2 the farmer and the laborer not being there to speak for themselves the tariff burden falls with grievous heaviness upon the poor man taxes being imposed upon the necessities rather than the luxuries of life poor and rich alike must eat three meals a day must wear one suit or one dress at a time and by a tax levied on the common food and clothing of man a poor farmer or tenant worth 1 000 may pay about as much tax as a man worth a hundred thousand these evils moreover are not only possible they are actual a trip to europe is all one needs to demonstrate this in london you can buy a suit of clothes for 12 that would cost you thirty at home you can buy a pair of gloves for 1 that would cost you 2 here your field glasses that cost you 12 in new york are offered you in parts for 3 and so on and so on there is another manner by which it may be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the entire tariff tax is levied directly upon the american consumer and that is that our manufacturers have long been selling their products in foreign countries at from 20 per cent to in some instances 65 per cent cheaper than to the home consumer the record is full of proof to this effect extending entirely through the period of the dingley law in an agricultural paper of recent date we clipped the following showing the difference between the prices here and abroad on certain agricultural implements for the chieftain hay tedder the americans pay 59 the foreigner pays 35 40 and in like proportions for all like things on plows of all kinds the discount to the foreign buyer is 25 per cent on all other horse rakes hay tedders and potato diggers 40 per cent on garden rakes the discount to the buyer is 70 and 5 on caststeel garden rakes it is 70 per cent some years ago some member of this house is reported by the new york world as sending a telegram to a wellknown protected manufacturer of new york asking him if it were true that he sold his products in a foreign country cheaper than at home within twenty minutes he received this reply of course we sell cheaper to foreigners than to americans what is protection for in this brief telegram the whole story of the thievery of protection is told if it is not intended for the robbery of the american consumer why should anyone desire it is it not high time for us to call a halt and consider for a moment the enormity of the wrong being perpetrated upon the millions of american consumers by the passage of this bill have they not for many years been robbed in season and out of season by the protected ghouls and heartless trusts under the dingley lanw indeed it seems that the mental conception of you republicans and especially those framing this bill is too narrow to compass all the rights of all the people you have been besieged by hundreds of lobbyists moving like an army of scavengers upon this capitol since it was announced that there would be a new tariff bill and each of them came with the avowed purpose to more fully enthrone his right to inflict a heartless tax upon the american consumer the lumber people the steel people the hat people the shoe people the hide people and every other protected class down to the puny peanut grafters have been here but we have been unable to find a single lobbyist from the great consuming masses it seems they have been accorded no hearings and judging from this bill their rights have received no consideration you have offered them the same sop that you have been dishing out for forty years the farmer is told that he will have a duty on corn which will do him about as much good as if you were to tax spring water for the one is about as abundant in this country as the other and the same old trick is to be played upon the american laborer he is again told that his brawn and muscle is not to be protected against the one and onequarter million paupers coming annually into this country to compete for his job and that the only protection be is entitled to is such crumbs as may fall from the table of some protected dives this bill is an outrage upon the rights of every farmer every laborer and every poor man and every consumer in this republic its every line is but another link in the cruel chain with which they have so long been manacled by the trust why should their hard earnings be taken to fill the coffers of the favored few they are not allowed to perform even in the chorus of this thieving drama there are some other schedules of this bill that i desire to speak of ninety per cent is lvied on shirts and drawers pants vests union suits combination suits tights sweaters corset covers and all underwear of every decription a tax of 80 per cent is levied on stockings hose and half hose a tax of 60 per cent is levied on womens and childrens dress goods 90 per cent on clothing readymade and articles of wearing apparel of every description wool hats and so forth also i find that diamonds in the rough are on the free list automobiles are taxed only 45 per cent champagne is taxed about 25 per cent if i were commissioned to write a tariff bill i would put 500 per cent on diamonds and jewels of every kind autos silks laces furs and every other luxury of the rich and place all of the foregoing necessaries of life on he free list what do the rich care for the price of anything rockefeller and morgan would as soon pay 500 for a diamond as 100 a dollar saved to the poor will do more good than a thousand saved to them the poor man counts his coppers they look after their millions but i want to be fair with you republicans you did attempt to do a little something for the american consumer when you reduced the tax on refined sugar the infinitesimal fraction of oneflinetysixth of 100 per cent this is a very generous concession indeed by it the poor are enabled to save 4 cents per annum or 1 in twentyfive years we thank you my beloved friends for your liberal generosity now sirs in the face of the foregoing how can you have the gall to face the american people and ask them for their votes in the next election how can you face the poor farmers and shop girls of america whose wearing apparel and whose gloves you have taxed more than 60 per cent while you have practically put the luxuries of the rich on the free list how are you going to face the 10 000 000 of little children who are at this very hour in which i am talking down on their knees lisping their little prayers now i lay me down to sleep robed in nightshirts and union suits upon which you have placed a tax of 90 per cent if they understood the full measure of your depravity they would add one more sentence to that worldfamous prayer and ask their maker to forgive your guilty souls and too how can you face santa claus when next christmas comes you propose to tax him out of the united states the teddy bears learning of the infamy of this measure are following their master to the wilds of africa and poor little billy possum is curling his tail and hiking out to the swamps of georgia and what are you going to say to the laboring man you have protected every industry you have by an average of 46 per cent tax while you give him nothing the only asset he has is his brawn and muscle you have provided yourselves against competition and left him to compete with the world he must shed his sweat and blood in competition with the million and a quarter alien paupers who annually land upon our shores now if you have one scintilla of honesty in your hearts and want to do something that will prove a benediction to the laboring man and a blessing to the country and that will also raise revenue for your depleted treasury vote with me to place a head tax of 100 on every foreigner coming into this country do this and the lord may forgive you for the falsehoods you have told the laborer do this and the people from one end of the nation to the other will call you blessed my able colleague was perfectly right when he said on last night that this average 46 per cent duty levied on the products consumed in the nation would bring enough to pay the 280 000 000 received by the government to pay the entire wages paid all the industrial laborers and leave quite three billions tax profit or tax graft in the hands of the manufacturers and trusts this means that the taxes levied by this bill amounts to more than 30 per capita on the 90 000 000 american people to more fully illustrate let me say that in 1908 we made agricultural implements valued in round numbers at 123 000 000 we exported 24 000 000 leaving for home consumption 99 000 000 adding the 20 per cent tax levied for the benefit of the trusts and the government jointly we find that the trusts got 12 000 000 while the government according to the treasury report received only 8 905 in other words on agricultural implements alone the american people have been taxed for the benefit of the trusts 12 000 000 and for the befiefit of the government only 8 905 this demonstrates the iniquity of protection in a nutshell and makes it so plain that a wayfaring man though a fool ought to see it in the sequel of the story as shown by these figures is to be found the explanation for the millionaires of new england and the paupers of the south this is why new england is rich and the south is poor"], [0.03502094745635986, 0.9649790525436401, 1, "democrat it is proposed by this bill oceanmail hill to pay for carrying our mail in american bottoms four times as much as we can get it carried for under competitive bids and that proposition is made under the guise of building up a merchant marine that can be available in times of war as auxiliary cruisers mir k ste n5iann republican quotes henry clews as follows why there are hindreds of fine vessels owned and operated today by americans which are actually forced to hide under foreign flags repeal our stupid navigation laws and the american flag would unonuestionably be seen waving in every port of consequence in the world what is the use of talking about the nonexistence of a merchant marine when we have one already in existence that would instantly do us credit did we not foolishly force it to hide and sail under false flags and to depend upon the more hospitable protection of other countries and other navies in truth we have literally protected our merchant marine to death these are some of the things said about the oceanmall bill which i voted against and you seem to advocate let me add that mr hrmsicany and mr gallinger whom you quote from and every other republican who favored that bill claimed it to he an extension of the principle of protection but i want you to observe that it does not aplly like ordinary protection to all persons engaged in similar business but only to certain individuals 6r companies selected to certain favored liues or ships and would leave all other american ships out in the cold in even worse fix than if these bills had not been passed every man who advocated this bill in congress claimed that owing to the higher initial cost of americanbuilt ships and the higher wages necessary to secure american ship officers and crews and the higher cost of repairs in protected american shipyards and greater expense in general of operating our ships under our laws it was absolutely impossible for a ship to fly the american flag on the ocean and successfully compete for the carrying trade of the world and this is absolutely true they also claimed that even if the american were allowed to buy his ship wherever he could get it cheapest still our navigation laws as they now are would prevent such competition and i think that perhaps also 1true the remedy proposed by the subsidists is not to give the right to buy ships where they can he bought cheapest and to repeal those navigation laws but to keep our present laws in effect and to pick out certain ships and pay them a subsidy in money from the treasury of the government for flying the american flag to make up to the ship its greater original cost and greater operating expenses and then give to its owner a good profit besides this is the principle of protection pure and simple only more limited and special it is impossible to pass any law by which the shipper can he made to pay a higher price for his freight or passenger fare on the ocean we therefore dont try but proplose to have our ships charge the same or a less price than the foreign ship charges and to give to our shlipowncrs a subsidy to cover his added expensiveness and to insure him a profit if snch a proposition should be extended equally to all shipowners it would be like the proposition a few years ago as to a sugar bounty the law gave to the raiser of sugar a bounty to enable him to make a profit while taking off the tariff to let the people have cheap sugar this bounty was extended to every sugar producer in the united states but notwithstanding cheaper sugar it grew so unpopular the law was repealed if we cant maintain an industry within our borders by a bounty ca n we maintain one beyond our borders on the high seas by a subsidy the subsidist realizes that to propose a subsidy to every amerfican shipowner who flies our flag would be preposterous therefore lie proposes a law under specious pretext to give only certain special ships for certain pretended services exorbitant prices if the government were to advertise for bids these services can be had at reasonable prices but it is proposed not to do this but to give double or quadruple the reasonable price to certain selected american vessels in return for which they wear the shackles of our law and fly the american flag thmls policy will sustain the limited number of american ships so subsidized but will not aid a single ship not subsidized and will not add a single ship to any real merchant marine the subsldist also pretends that having no ships carrying the american flag on the ocean we have no means of carrying our passengers and mali and freight to all tie world and therefore lose out in our commerce with the world hils is untrue we have exactly the same transportation facilities that any other nation has and wherever we have the commerce to support it the ships of england and germany will and do enrry our passengers and freight just as cheaply as they do tile passengeis or freight of england or germany a great deal is made of tile fact that there is not much traffic no quick transportation between us anud south america and that a passenger may make time by going by way of europe to get to rio do janeiro that is simply because we have but little trade with south america our trade with the republics of south america is about onefifth of the trade of europe with those repulblics to be specific the total imports and exports of those republics including mexico is 1 977 737 019 while the imports and exports to and from tile united states is 403 609 935 this condition is brought about in tile same way that our trade condition with the rest of the world is brought about the truthl is outside of our agrlcultulral products the balance of trade last year or in 1907 was 123 000 000 against us under our tariff system wve are hampered as to our foreign trade the south american republics buy manufactures chiefly and sell agricultural products chiefly they can buy the se uanufactures in tihe main cheaper from europe and thley can sell itheir agricultural products almost altogether to better advantage in europe our entire foreigin trade is peculiar ouir exports are perhaps three or four times our imports in weigh t and bulk newr york our largest port for imports exportid in 1900 5 000 000 tonls and imported 4 0010 000 tons while galveston imported 57 9003 tons and exported 1 433 041 tons our other ports were on the order of galveston largely all this is because our exports are so largely agricultural bulky and cheap products our outgoing commerce goes to england germany france italy and countries that use our agricultural products whilch are perlhsps threcfourths in bulk of all our exports these countries are fencing with us inl the game of exclusion they buy nothing from us that they can make at any prlceat home all of them have high tariff wails except england and she excludes us by making manufactures cheaper than we while her prosperous colonies like canada and austriili have tariff wails against ius nearly as high as our own besides this our home market for manufactu res is so large and rich that our manufacturers hlave tihe greatest market for their wvares in the world even if they sell to nobody else this honme market is securely theirs at any price anid tile natuirlil tenldency is to stilt their prices heie and under big profits to stimulate expensive methlods and reckless extravagance and to lose ingenuity in implroving and economizing prodncltlon from all this it hnapiens that even after allowing our manufacturers to elharge th~eir houle people from a third t o oniehalf more than they do the outsider they can still sell hilt little compared wvith england or germany anywhere exceplt at hlome therefore ships starting out from the united states arc leadedt with our agricultural produets these go to europe they get siaili or 110 cargoles from thence lback to us bnt must break into tile trade of europe wvith otlier cou~ntries and carry european exports to oiler countries for american ships this would naturallly have its difficulties since doubtless the same enlglishmnan that is exporting his goode is frequently interested in einglish shlips and shipping aud it would be hard for our ships to secure the carrying trade of the english manufacturer to english enscomers in which we have no interest on tile other hand england ships 11er products to south america sells them ceeper than we can takes in exchange products of theirs generally agricultural which she may either take home or bring to the united states to exchange for our agrlinltural products and these latter she carries home on her profitmaking joyladen ships but that lsnt all british ships are tile cheapest built in the world and it at any time they find a cargo from one part to the other of the britisil emp~ire they are not forbidden to carry it but how is it with us if we buy a cheap ship we must pay the penalty of being excluded from ever hauling a ton of our coastwise or inland conmmerce it nms thlis exclusion largely that made tt impossible for the one or two ships which bly some special law were authlorized to fly tile american flag though hiutlt in another country to succeed and prosper germany helps 11cr merchalnt marine and shipbuilding by allowing the latter to bny bluilding material wherever it can be bought cheapest and giving it the very lowest or free tirsnsportatlon and by allowing her merchant marine the further privilege of buying ships abroad if thley can be bought cheaper if we want to compete on the seas willh theose countries hadnt wve better adopt some of their laws and repeal some of ours under the operation of which our flag has been driven from tile seas it is a remarkable fact thlat if a prince bountiful sbould p repose to give some worthy citizen of the united states a whole fleet of merchant vessels to be used in carrying constwise or inland commerce and offer to pay the government import duties on it oar laws would not permit it we havent gone that far quite with anything else prince bountifuil can give us a suit of clothes or an automobile a painting or a cannon anything in fact if he will pay the dutyexcept a ship but the shipbhuilding trust and the steel trust are no sacred you can not have a ship ad the right to use it here unless it is built here a siiip built elsewhere cant ply our sacred waters because they huelong to tile graft of the steel trust and the shipbuilders truest of our owni dear lend and tis dear land of ours belongs exclusively to the favored interests who can and do gharge us more for the goods that we buy and the transportation in the precious americanbuilt ships of those goods than any other country the subsidist refuses to look at or listen to these thlilgs lint simply asserts and you assert with him that we cant have ships oul tile seas withlout a subsidy and cant have torelign conmmerce without shilps on the seas flying our flag tile state of our south american commierce ought to show you what is the matter even in panama which is practically a little united states dependency wherein hundreds of millions of our money is being spent with our ships going hack and fortil we are unable to sell our textile goods a full reading of the jfuly 1901 bulletin of the american republics simply shlows thlat even in panama outside of agricultural produlcts thle tunited states can not and does not hold her own with great britain a great ado is made ever tile cillim thlat when our navy w~nt around the world she was accompanied by the flags of many nations carrying her fuel coal and thlat in case of war all these ships would have fallen off and left our navy stranded on the highl seas this is a beautiful little falsehood doulbtiess believed to lbe true by many whlo utter it hnd more who hear it tile facts arc these when our naval cruise was determined on thle sulbsidy question was presented in concrete form the government would aced coal at certain stations along thleir route thlere were two ways of getting it the first was to give tile job to the lowest bidder the second was to cut out all foreign bidders and give it to some american ship firm regardless of cost the government wisely adopted tile first plan althoighl it was easily and absolultely in their power to have adopted the second tile foreign ships did not accompany the navy but at contract price placed tile cool at the various coaling stations before our navy started on its cruise this is all there is to that bugaboo foreign ships offered to pla e our coal for us and even mr roosevelt was not willing to pay enough to subsidize american vessels to do the work and he let it out to the lowest bidder you quote mr landis as saying we pay approximately 500 000 per day to foreign ships for carrying our commerce this is perhaps true or rather we pay that sum to ships flying foreign flags a great many of whom are owned and operated by american capitalists but the subsidist contends that we cant under our present law carry this commerce under the american flag for less than about 30 per cent more while the mail subsidies we have granted and those proposed by the oceanmail bill which i voted against add far more than 30 per cent to the reasonable cost of transportation in order therefore to sufficiently subsidize american ships for this work according to the figures of mr landis we would have to grant them a subsidy of at least 150 000 per day or fiftyfive millions per year does this seem good to you tile transportation of the outside world can not be walled up and handed over on favored terms this nation can not guarantee certain capitalists or seamen higher profits and wages than the profits and wages earned by ships and crews that float by their side on the seas we do not provide one scale of wages for the foreigner and one for the american who work side by side on land within our border we can not do it on the seas after all we get back to the question of protection whatever foreign trade we have left must be carried by somebody that trade is mostly the cotton of the south and the grain of the west five ships are at our doors the american the british the german the italian the norwegian norway never gave a subsidy the americanno matter what the reasonsays i can not carry your cotton and wheat for less than 40 cents per hundred pounds the german british italian or norwegian offers to carry it for 20 cents under these conditions you propose to give it to the american ship but instead of making the shipper pay the whole 40 cents you make him pay only the 20 cents and the whole american people pay an additional 20 cents by subsidy from the general revenues of the government but these subsidy people are not content to ask us to pay 20 cents subsidy on our cotton or wheat they want to carry freight for other nations and want us to make up all they say they lose in attempting to compete and a profit besides on the carrying of that other freight so that they can capture the carrying trade of the world we can they say neither build ships nor carry traffic as cheap as other people still they ask that by a subsidy we build up a big shipbuilding ndustry and a large merchant marine it will not do they tell us to buy our ships where we could get them cheapest that would break the happy grasp of the united states steel company we can not compete they tell us on the seas even if we had the cheapest vessels we have no longer the genius or skill they say to compete in the carrying trade and our young men can make so much money on land they will not go to sea at the same wages the foreigner pays so they want to pay them enough to go and they want the government to give them the money to pay with this is the shipsubsidy plea if it is true it proves too much it means that we can not now or ever expect to compete with these foreign nations but must always use a subsidy instead of a tariff to prevent competition and to guarantee profit to our merchant marine they might go further and truthfully say and i think many of them do that if the american vessels carry american freight outward they must come back empty unless they bring back goods for other countries we have tried and about succeeded in limiting our imports to coffee tea sugar hides and other things that we do not produce at all or that we can not produce enough of to supply our home market to absolutely so limit our imports is the aim and purpose of the protectionist this makes our foreign trade one sided we sell our agricultural surplus and must sell it to the manufacturing nations and the little that we buy from them will not fill our ships returning home they take our cotton and grain to liverpool manchester or hamburg they bring back german and english manufactures to mexico south america or canada and for this service by american vessels to england south america germany and canada our subsidy friends tell us we must permanently provide an ample guaranty of profits to keep our ships on the seas you must subsidize you must paypay today tomorrow and forever protection makes many problems the first is how to sell to all the great nations of the earth without buying from them how to build a high wall around our country that will keep out foreign merchandise without keeping in their own and the second is how to do the carrying trade of the world without doing it as cheaply as other nations will do it nearly all other nations are trying hard to build the same kind of a wall new england trie to play the old game of the white man and the indian you take the buzzard and ill take the turkey or ill take the turkey and you take the buzzard she has played this game on the agricultural classes at home for a hundred years she comes to us now and says you have given us all your trade you have agreed to sacrifice your products by selling them in markets where you can not buy anything you have consented that we may charge you from onethird to onehalf more than we do the foreigner for our goodsand by so doing we stand on your shoulders and hand out our manufactures over tie wall that is so high the foreigner can not come in now go a bit further get over the wall and let us mount your backs and ride you all over the world through all the marts of trade where we may find a market for our wares there are but two animals who patiently bear such burdensone is a fool the other is an ass you echo the shibboleth of the protected interests in crying out that our foreign commerce is dying because we have no ships flying our flag while the truth is our foreign commerce is languishing and our merchant marine is dead because our manufactures and our transportation are the highest priced in the world the problem you are up against what you want to find is how to make foreigners buy our higbpriced wares in preference to the lowpriced wares of other countries and how to make beth the foreigner and ourselves pay for highpriced transportation in preference to lowpriced transportation on the high seas you and the protectionists have nb trouble as to our own people in our own markets and in our coastwise and inland transportation here you accomplish your purpose by high tariff and navigation laws but on the high seas it is different those of us opposed to a ship subsidy believe that with the right granted to buy ships anywhere in the world and with our navigation laws repealed or replaced by the liberal laws of england our merchant ships can compete with the ships of any other country either this is true or it is not true if it is true we need no subsidy our duty is clear if it is not true then indeed our merchant marine is dead and dead for all time for we will never engage in any business which we know we can only follow at a loss our flag has been pulled down in all seas by the tariff and steel trust and our navigation laws our shipbuilding except for coastwise and inland trade has been slaughtered by the tariff and the steel trust our merchant marine has been done to death but let me say for the shipbuilders that perhaps they are not very much to blame they are between the upper and the nether millstone between the egyptian spoilers and the red sea they have no pillar of fire or of cloud to guide them and no rod to divide the waters they can not build ships in competition with the world unless we give them like the germans free materials to build with and this the steel trust will not permit us to do so long as the republicans are in powerand they will remain in power as long as money can corrupt public sentiment and control elections let me be plain with you if it be true as all shipsubsidy advocates say that we can not compete on equal terms with other nations on the high seas now or ever then i have no plans for building up our merchant marine any more than i have plans by which to foster the growing of beans in this country if we can not now or ever grow them as cheaply as we can buy them abroad anymore than i have plans to favorby which american manufacturers can capture the foreign markets for their wares if they can not now or ever compete with the foreigner in the cheapness of those wares but i do not believe what these subsidy grabbers say i do believe that with free ships and no more restrictions than england has for her merchant marine the merchant marine of america would revive at once and that is my plan my only plan we have millions upon millions of dollars of american capital now invested in ocean carrying but flying some other flag than ours let them have no more restrictions under our flag than they have under other flags and they will by preference fly our flag the sea belongs to all nations but the ship and the flag belong to one thousands of our young men who find it difficult to get employment at home will be willing to take the wages that could be given them if they had the pride of their own nation to thrill them when they looked on their own flag floating above them and american genius can be safely looked to to enable them to earn higher wages than the foreigner england keeps her ships afloat withoutsubsidy notwithstanding the cheaper labor of germany france italy and all her competitors but our protected interests have so lost all reliance on their own ability to meet the world that they sit down behind the tariff wall combine together cease to compete even among themselves fall behind in the race for international superiority confess their supreme incapacity and at every turn plead the baby act and call on the government for protection or subsidy i know the subsidy people say england subsidizes her merchant marine but that is absolutely false greed and graft are not dead in england it is true and special interests there as here have secured favors and england has given friendly government contracts to these favorites who are tapping the public till there but over 90 per cent of her merchant marine lives and flourishes without receiving one dollar from the english government in any manner whatsoever let us imitate her wisdom and not her folly my plan of course is bitterly opposed by protected shipbuilders and steel trusts and all protected interests who hold our internal trade under laws that enable them to do it without competition if this were not so the plan i have named would be adopted immediately and before many years you would see the largest and proudest merchant marine afloat flying the american flag and with threefourths of all her crews sons of america they would certainly have as large a percentage of americans among their seamen as there are among the operatives in the great steel plants of pittsburg or the factories of new england today and i am right tired of hearing the plea for high wages to the american laborer used by every shrewd hunter for special favor who just as soon asthe favor is granted employs a foreigner if he can get him any cheaper than he can the american just one little matter i had forgotten it is claimed that on foreign mail our postoffice makes a profit in the difference between what it costs the government to carry that mail and the postage she collects from her people for carrying it and that this profit could be without burden to her people given as a subsidy to special ship companies i do not look at it that way if we charge too much for foreign mail we should remit it to the people who pay it by lessening the postage charges and not turn it over to some special interest or favorite but our postoffice department as a whole is not selfsustaining some of its branches make a profit and some a loss if we cut off or give away all the profits where profit is made and try to carry all the losses the postoffice alone may swamp the government one thing further i am opposed to burdening our people with a vast navy but i am more opposed to subsidizing enough ships in time of peace to act as colliers and transports for the navy and army in time of war in case of war if it should come today i would conscript every american ship that is engaged in coastwise or inland trade if necessary we have just as much right to do that as we would have to call on our oceangoing vessels if we had them so that all this talk about our navy being helpless in case of war is false but if we must have colliers and transports and our favored coastwise vessels are too sacred to call on in time of war then i would let the government build and own all necessary colliers and transports and in time of peace use them in carrying the mail and otherwise so as to make them as nearly as possible if not fully selfsustaining you say this is not a party question its strongest advocates like"], [0.03515559434890747, 0.9648444056510925, 1, "i will say to the gentleman from illinois sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and he has no reason to apprehend that whenever in future he may ask an extension of time i shall object to his continuing ten fifteen twenty minutes or an hour or even more and my use of the word immunity applied to the chair and not to my colleagues who are at liberty to converse with me here and elsewhere whenever they choose i am against the proposition of the gentleman from ohio and am in favor of the amendment offered by the gentleman from missouri to strike out the last two words i want to strike out as many words as i can from this section therefore my opposition rises to the magnitude of full cooperation with the gentleman from iowa i would be glad to strike it all out i would have moved to strike out the enacting clause from the bill but a great many gentlemen told me that as the bill carried some good things they hoped that there would be found in this body patriotism enough and independence enough to strike out the evil provisions and allow us to enact into law the good provisions that consummation devoutly to be wished i would like to aid in reaching if possible therefore i did not make the motion to strike out the enacting clause the first clause we reach is one of the bad ones and it has been strangely unfortunate in the efforts of the people to secure regulation of rates and practices that ever since my service in this body our efforts have been met by propositions to do something else six years ago after years of agitation and demand to give the commission the power the supreme court said they did not have and which it was our intention to give them in the first enactment in 1887 we came here asking for a simple enlargement of their power to enable them to determine and enforce a rate that was something in the interest of the people that favored regulation we were met by a dozen different propositions to do sofething else whenever any pretense to relieve the people was made it was accompanied by other provisions of advantage to the carriers producing greater confusion and greater inequality and greater profits at that time one or two of the bill openly declared for the abolition of the interstate commerce commission the power of which we are trying to strengthen which the people demand and which my party demands in its last platform the proposition was made in several congresses past to create a court and there were propositions for transportation bureaus and this and that and the other and all sorts of things except the plain proposition of power to regulate the rates and practices in interstate commerce to divert attention to something else and doing something to give the people a stone when they asked for bread and a serpent when they asked for a fish when this honest demand for further power for the commission is made it is met by this bill presented professedly for regulation but the very first section in it proposes to dwarf the power of the interstate connerce commission by placing over it directly under a name so similar as to carry to the public mind under all the circumstances the idea of domination and control placing over it the commerce court why do gentlemen say that is done to facilitate business we have had real improvement in the last six or eight years in the way of accelerating cases and expediting this business there is no trouble about that gentlemen who can run over the country and see the laborious labors of the laborious circuit judges presiding two or three hours a day a few days in the week and a few weeks in the year know as well as i do that there is not any need for a new court so far as the work is concerned and if you concentrate the work here and put all the grits in one hopper and force it through one channel in one court under the rules of law and rules of evidence it will halt retard and congest instead of expediting the business leaving the circuit courts with that much less to do and everybody who has any common sense knows it now the cat in the meal tub is this the object of the court is not to expedite business i do not care anything about the expense if it is necessary you can have a half a million dollars for the court if it is needed what the people want is regulation of rates and practices but those pressing this legislation have turned right about and they are talking about protecting four or five families of capitalists who have seen proper to take charge of the railroad stocks and bonds of the united states whereby they can levy eternal and eternally increasing custom upon the public and give them facilities to increase the value of their holdings to consolidate their lines reduce the number of their employees increase their profits and further control the trade and business of the people and prevent the building of new lines to compete with them throughout the country where they are needed the actual business designed for this court is the last half of secti6n 12 whereby the anomaly is presented of allowing these financial freebooters who have gone over the country and contrary to law and decency and honesty and reason bought all the stocks and bonds of the chartered corporations designed for public service and dumped all the profits of that service in their own pockets regardless of the people to enable them to forestall the future to do what no other person can do in any countrygo into court before he commits a deed and have the deed pa ssed upon in advance and guilty or innocence adjudged before the act is done whether the deed is that of murder or robbery or whether a man makes a trade whether he buys land no matter what his conduct is when the ordinary citizen under the policy authorized under the laws of god and man takes his moral option in his hands and uses his judgment does what he sees proper to do and afterwirds answers therefor according to his deed our entire judicial policy is to be reversed and these people are to be permitted to go not into the ordinary open courts of our country that have stood for more than one hundred years where everybody has a chance to go in and look on and see what is being done not the regular ordinary courts that have character and standing but a special court is to be created whose personnel is to be composed of experts in the line of business in which they are engaged and they are to be permitted to decide beforehand that financiers can buy up two competing roads or four or six and be subject to no punishment if the conduct of that court gratifies these conspirators they may proceed in successive cases to the consolidation of all public carriers in the united states it may go to that limit and if you have it in five families you might just as well have it in one system anyhow it is the limit of consolidation now if a question of fact as to competition should ever come up at all it ought to come up before the interstate commerce commission to be determined as a matter of fact and not as a question of law at all but if you will read the language in the original bill you will see what was intended and what they are going to put on you in conference before they quit and that is by a latitude of evidence which shocks the moral sense to allow the court to exercise opinion as to its effect on trade and transportation and the public good as to whether these fellows shall own all the competing lines or not if in a particular instance the result would be lower transportation or something of that kind anything they may consider and it is that proposition and not this one that you are going to vote on when you vote for this bill the other section which my friend from michigan mentioned in colloquy with the gentleman from missouri section 7 does also violate the antitrust law but the last half of section 12 provides that the court in advance may say you may consolidate as much as you please if you will submit it to us beforehand and you can not be affected by the antitrust law section 7 does the same thing but section 7 does not make business for this court it is the last half of section 12 that is intended for this court and if you strike out that abomination entirely there will be nothing else for which even the friends of this measure want this court most of the arguments for the bill are excuses poor and partial ones at that men known to oppose other obnoxious features cite garbled extracts and strained constructions from judicial decisions to excuse the stockandbond feature and then indorse the entire bill it is easy to abandon the combat for principle and do wrong the tendency is to subvert the constitution by construction to serve special purposes at the expense of popular right and justice those who resist have a hard struggle and the people often forget their services and fail to realize their friendship sometimes even being misled into denouncing and destroying their defenders he who yields however to special interest never suffers such a fate the favored interests never sleep nor forget nor fail in gratitude if however all should yield and give up the fight popular right and constitutional liberty would end in this world to revive no more forever for there is no other new continent on which to start a new experiment in constitutional government the suggestion of the gentleman from michigan that if this bill does not prove satisfactory we can repeal it next session is a mockery unworthy of him it impeaches either his intelligence or his sincerity he knows that things do not move that way in government wrong and aggression never give back once intrenched in position they movp their standards forward but never backward they fall from free government into monarchy but they never rise from monarchy to liberty every great republic the world ever saw died through the putrid dismemberment and dissolution of class government supported and administered in the interest of the classes and in every notable instance the fall from the high estate of liberty to slavery and ruin was effected through the same subserviency to mammon and deification of financial interests that are working the rapid change in our governmental ideals and practices if the administration and congress are bent on freeing the owners of stocks and bonds from the operation of the laws against combinations and conspiracies in restraint of honest and fair trade and commerce it would be much more decent to come out openly and say so the open and bold repeal of the antitrust law would be much more creditable than the cunning yet patent and disreputable tricks resorted to in sections 7 and 12 i prefer the style in that respect of the gentleman from massachusetts he is frank and open in his demands against the public his propositions give me no trouble at all being openly and absolutely wrong in his propositions it is not necessary to make any effort to agree with him in the amendment he proposes he offers to destroy competition and legalize monopoly outright he is a little uncandid however in his protest against suggestions that judges might entertain predelictions in the line of reasoning pursued by the financial magnates as he proposes to reach his object by judicial procedure of course he must have a court if the judges do not serve his purposes his court is vain and useless he ought to remember his own argument that the commerce court is to have commerce judges presiding over it who have been commerce lawyers and other commerce lawyers practicing in that court who are training to make experts from whom future commerce judges are to be appointed he exhibits also the facility with which special interests can find defenders they furnish him ready for use the argument of a new york corporation lawyer going boldly into the record after citing some specific matters of administration some war measures and one appropriation bill necessarily reproduced in a joint resolution sent to congress by some president which by no means accomplishes his task of justifying or showing a resemblance to the executive performance in connection with this bill that argument proceeds to support the course pursued in this bill but as usual in such efforts proves too much if anything it is practically insisted that the president is more competent than congress and therefore ought to do all the legislation he blunders into one unfortunate citation he quotes what he calls the first declaration by congress in favor of continuous lines of traffic in interstate commerce and unwittingly includes the following sentence of that law this section shall not be construed to authorize any railroad company to build any new road or any connection with another road without authority from the state in which such railroad or connection shall be proposed that looks like respecting the constitution and is very similar to the language which this bill strikes from the first section of the original commerce act i denominate that a surreptitious effort to repeal the constitution of the united states and i shall offer an amendment to restore the language the attempted repeal is an attack on all the railroad commissions in the united states and an assault on all local authority in the united states looking to the impairment of the local utility of all the railroads in the united states all the state railroad commissions are up in arms against it and the national association of railroad commissioners is loud in its protest when centralization servilely crawling and groveling and fattening at the behest of greed and gold shall have deprived the states of all local authority control of business and opportunity to promote the peace happiness and prosperity of its citizens in the pursuit of life liberty and happiness it ought generously to relieve them also of the burden of the police power for why should the states maintain the burden of policing their territory with no commerce nor business to superintend and no inducement to profit or progress a good deal of nonsense has been indulged in about prejudice against railroads there is none anywhere everybody likes railroads and wants railroads they are necessary and it is to the public interest that they be allowed to perform their functions they should not be wrecked nor dynamited physically neither exploited wrecked nor impaired in their usefulness merely to gratify the greed which makes investments in them knowing their nature and purposes intending to violate both for the hope of gain which alone invites the investment when the states delegated specified powers for general purposes of the federal government they reserved the right and duty of taking care of the morals and local questions and interests it was not intended that the federal government should charter corporationssurely even implication and intendment could justify nonebeyond such as might be claimed as necessary to carry out purposes connected with and cognate to the administration of the government itself and even those are of doubtful propriety and sustained only by strained construction if the federal government grants a charter it should prescribe powers and duties exacting scrupulous honesty in its organization and transactions even then its conduct and affairs must conform to local police regulations wherever encountered corporations are properly chartered by the states the guardians of morals and honesty and property and adapted to look after good conduct and regulations for the protection of business dealings and financial investment they are not subject to federal law except for taxation unless their physical operations extend beyond the confines of the state if they operate instrumentalities of transportation in interstate commerce they subject themselves to federal regulation of their rates and practices by virtue of the commerce clause of the constitution if their physical operations resulting from combinations act in restraint of interstate trade and commerce they violate the antitrust law if our kind friends who try to enlighten us about the democratic platform would study that platform with the spirit and understanding they would find it quite favorable to retaining and strengthening the antitrust law and they will find the american people in the same state of mind the investing public over whom the gentleman from michigan shed such crocodile tears a few days ago he should have explained consists of three or four families and clans of financiers who having acquired by various means the control of the stocks and bonds of the principal railroads in the united states and practiced all kinds of legerdemain in exploiting them naturally desire to hold all they have secure by legislation the results and values of their past transactions augment their profits for the future and perpetuate the process in geometrical progression they find that the regulation by the states where chartered reserves and secures to the people some semblance of fair rates and treatment by those corporations so these financiers demand that the federal government under the commerce clause of the constitution strike down all local authority and permit them to conduct their operations without restraint or supervision except by the federal government they are satisfied that as long as the republican party controls the federal government reciprocal arrangements for mutual support and protection will render such regulations safe and harmless while exceedingly profitable in proportion to the amount of campaign contributions the charters the iron bars the crossties the roadbed the bridges the trestles the depots are quiet and orderly enough the conductors and agents and engineers and almost all of the operatives i have ever met are good square honest men who want to treat the people right and i like every one of them i ever knew and think they ought to receive better treatment than they now enjoy everything is all right except the infernal greed and utter callous disregard of human right and local interest actuating the handful of bondholders and stockholders constituting brother townsends investing public who demand that the character of the corporations and the constitutional character of our government be so changed as to exempt them from local authority and deprive the people of local benefit and why the bondholders want to ratify and make secure all watered and fraudulent speculations up to date and make themselves secure in the future control of consolidation and construction there will then be no danger of new competition arising through the construction of new and independent lines however much they may be needed to develop new country now unserved by transportation facilities and to relieve a thousand bottledup towns which having only one railroad are robbed by it without mercy they will not build new lines unless dictated by their own interest local capital and other small capitalists will fear to embark in the enterprises knowing that favored by the federal system of regulation the enterprise will sooner or later be gobbled up by the established monopoly they can ignore local restrictions and regulations and make more money by discouraging and strangling all new developments if sections 12 13 14 and 15 are enacted into law all points and sections of the country now crying for relief and hoping for development may bid farewell to hope if they are not able to ride to a railroad they can walk i know in my own country where a thousand miles of new railroad are badly needed right now but the provisions of this bill will cast such a pall of discouragement that if hope does not die it will hide out for a long time some of my brethren professed not to understand the system of combining roads so as to increase the aggregate value of stocks and bonds without further investment of cash they ought to study chemistry two poisons often combine and make a wholesome indispensable necessary drug two weak and insignificant elements sometimes make a powerful compound dissimilar ingredients make a product dissimilar to both more valuable and powerful than either far more wonderful is the alchemy of money two weak roads both of which serve the public earn fair money satisfy their promoters and the local demand brother townsends three or four new york families constituting the investing public consolidate the two roads reduce the operating expenses reduce the convenience to the public by running fewer trains and more crowded cars exterminate all possibility of a competing line and the combined stock and bonds of the two original roads reissued in the same amount by the consolidation will increase in value by leaps and bounds instead of the pernicious provisions for consolidation offered in sections 12 13 14 and 15 we ought to adopt first a plan for valuation of railroad property second when carriers urge investment as a reason for increased rate they ought to be required to show the stocks and bonds issued what amount of money they have brought in and what was done with the money the federal government can not afford to insure the profits of speculators in all their transactions in the securities of publicservice corporations that is what is being undertaken in these last provisions federal legislation may unnaturally increase values for a while correspondingly depressing prices and wages in other directions but federal legislation can no more insure stability in the values of railroad stocks and bonds than it can control the seasons the storms and the winds of heaven one fact already mentioned stands out conspicuous in all efforts to regulate interstate commerce when the people have demanded regulation congress while pretending compliance has protected the special interests when after years of agitation a pretense of legislation in 1904 was railroaded through the iouse and then in accordance with previous arrangement pigeonholed in the senate the administration and the dominant party seemed to share the antipathy of the carriers toward the interstate commerce commission and all control it is known that the commerce commission gets busy turns up the facts exposes violations of the law sometimes making the carriers very uncomfortable therefore the commerce commission is very obnoxious to the carriers so in 1904 we began to hear about the commerce court and bureaus of transportation the abolition of the commerce commission as a partisan tribunal and everything in the world but what the people demanded the increase of the powers of the commission so that they could determine and enforce reasonable and just rates disappointed and infuriated by failure that year the people became so importunate that a reluctant administration was compelled to come to their relief in the next congress and w e got half a loaf even the spectacular person then in the white house did not give us instructions and a full text as to all the details of a bill neither did he turn the wheels backward for what he advocated was mainly an advance but it was only temporary and the cart not only stopped when he did but commenced rolling back with rapidly increasing celerity the proposed bill if passed will blot out and undo all that was accomplished then all that was done before and carry out of existence before the overwhelming onslaught of usurpation and the oppression of judicial construction all local rate regulation and authority the desperate extremities resorted to by the administration to enact into law the objectionable features of this bill suggest that the administration may be straining every nerve to pay a political debt to campaign contributors who hold the railroad stocks and bonds realizing the necessity to pay it now and pay it quickly before the next election relegates to political bankruptcy the perfidious party of graft and deceit and corruption and renders it forever unable to make payment that party already accursed throughout the earth for its perfidy in the tariff bill that insulted the intelligence while it robbed the pockets of the people can not hope to regain popular favor by enacting this bill into law if possible it is meaner than the tariff bill it affects about as large a number of people though perhaps not affecting each one to as great an extent but in proportion to the amounts involved to the individual citizen this bill is in the method of its preparation and enactment and its obvious purpose to favor certain beneficiaries more pernicious and will be pronounced more infamous when the people come to realize its full character and significance there are too many honest and intelligent voters in the united states to permit the further triumph of a party that would crown a long line of iniquities by foisting this base measure upon the people"],

kentucky the legislature of kentucky and of myself as a member of this house i simply ask at your hands the privilegeand right to make a plain statement of facts and a plain statement of truth because the people of kentucky the courts of kentucky the legislature of kentucky are not afraid to stand before the bar of public opinion of this country and let the whole truth be known to the whole people of this nation now in the headlines of this paper there is this statement hand of horror casts a shadow over kentuckyhope for protection in blue grass state is given upinhuman murders by the night itldersburley tobacco trust works evils and hardships upon population and in the beginning of this article i read in the month of january 1910 she is in a state of war for the open shop on the farm her people her law officers and her courts have gone down in battle the burley tobacco societythe closed shop for the farmhas assumed to be more powerful than the government and in four years that society has made good its claimtemporarily at least i want to stand here as a member of this house and denounce that statement every word of it as untrue there has never been a time in the history of kentucky when her people were more prosperous than now than when there was more peace and plenty and harmony among the citizenship of the state than at this present time i call on every member of the kentucky delegation regardless of their politics upon this floor to bear me out in the truth of that statement and in defense of my native state i hurl back the charge of this paper and say that every word and every line of it is untrue there is a statement in connection with this matter that i desire to call to the attention of the house five of the seven members of the state court of appeals the tribunal of last resort in kentucky are openly designated as not only belonging to the society but being owned by it this paper refers to the burley tobacco society of which mr clarence le bus is president and to the society of equity in kentucky of which i have the honor to be president it says the state chief justice has not hesitated to criticise the governor for calling out the troops or to intimate that it was done at the behest of the tobacco trust gentlemen of the house i want to say to you that this is a criticism which has been leveled against the chief justice of kentucky judge orear judge d e orear is a lifelong republican in politics as a democrat it gives me pleasure to stand upon the floor of the national house and say that there is hardly any man in kentucky who is more beloved by the great common people of kentucky than judge orear is and that it is because he has stood up for the rights of the common people of our commonwealth now i want to say gentlemen of the house that there is absolutely no truth that can be borne out by fact that the members of our supreme court are controlled by this organization of farmers in kentucky and i resent the charge as a citizen of kentucky and as a member of this house fromkentucky i resent the false charge that is hurled by this paper against the supreme court of our state and especially against judge orear the chief justice of our court i quote further from the washington times the legislature has been induced to ignore the state constitution and enact a law putting pooling contracts in a class peculiarly favorable to the burley society and peculiarly hard for the signer i want to denounce that statement as false i want to say that the act that this bears reference to was passed without political division two years ago in kentucky it was passed upon by the supreme court of kentucky and instead of violating the constitution of kentucky our supreme court by a unanimous decision of its seven judges decided that the act was directly in accordance with the constitution of kentucky and that it was a constitutional act so i desire to defend the legislature of kentucky from this false charge that has been hurled against it in that respect now gentlemen of the house i want to call attention to this fact i want to make an appeal before the bar of public opinion of this nation in our behalf i want to make an appeal to the membership of this house in our behalf kentucky has had a hard time i say that the peace and tlehabpness that pervades our country today is there because the farmers of kentucky have exercised the godgiven and legal right by cooperation the farmers standing by themselves to wrest from the great trust of this country that return that the growers of a product of the country have the right to demand so my friends when those engaged in the tobacco business the greatest industry in our commonwealth have whipped the trust to a standstill there is an outcry against that let me say to the gentlemen here who represent agricultural constituencies that it is not necessary to come to congress praying for legislation to protect the farmer irecollect well that at the very beginning of this congress the chairman of the ways and means committee said that there was too much demagogy for the farmers of the country i agree with him if you gentlemen here will go back home and tell the farmers of your districts to organize to get together and cooperate and stand together they have it in their power when they have learned the lesson like the farmers of kentucky to be more prosperous as our farmers are and my friends when we have organized when we have increased the price of our tobacco from 6 cents to 17 or 18 cents a pound which means an increased income in our state of from 25 000 000 to 30 000 000 annually then this great government proposes to step in and say that the farmers of kentucky shall not have the godgiven right to organize to protect themselves from one of the greedy trusts of this nationthe american tobacco company however gentlemen of the house in justice to the american tobacco company i desire to make the statement that when last year this concern bought our tobacco in the pool it complied with every provision of its contract with us which is more than can be said of many independent manufacturers of tobacco in the country whom our farmers association absolutely saved from ruin i call your attention to these headlines i hope they are not true i have not had an opportunity to take it up with the attorneygeneral the head of the department of justice but this statement is made in the headlines of this paper agents of uncle sam have been working secretly amid dangers to couple the burley tobacco society with the outlaw night riders i want to say to you gentlemen of the house that the officals of the burley tobacco society in kentucky with the officials of the society of equity in kentucky are the peers of any class of men for their morality honesty and integrity existing in this nation today i say it is a shame and an outrage if this statement is true that the power of this great government when they have not borne us down and defeated us by legislation that now they undertake to bring the power of the federal government to say to the farmers of kentucky that we shall not organize here on this floor i want to return my thanks to this congress for passing a bill which has repealed the 6cent tax upon leaf tobacco i want further publicly to thank some gentlemen on the ways and means committee on the majority side especially the gentleman from kansas who did so much in our behalf our people appreciate that there is no politics whatever in this statement that i am making to you here today we will not allow politics in kentucky to creep into this matter the very head of the burley tobacco society mr le bus has always been a stalwart republican and i the president of the society of equity have always been and am now a straight democrat and so gentlemen i want to say to you that all that i ask is a fair hearing before the bar of public opinion of this nation now i want to quote still further from the same article finally the very object of the burley pool1above the advancing of the pricehas been abandoned the burley society that began as the open enemy of the trust has ended by hooking up with it burley and equity officials have helped drive the independent manufacturers out of business mr cantrill in my presence insisted that the trust and the society were natural allies and that the best possible situation was that of one seller the burley society and one buyer the trust i want to say that that statement is not true it is not correct i have made the statemefit from time to time going upon the stump in kentucky and standing here i reiterate it now and that is that whenever the product of the farmers of kentucky is absolutely at the mercy of one buyer that the only way that the farmer can protect himself is to put his produce in the hands of one seller and let it be one seller against one buyer but there is a vast difference between that statement and the false statement that i have just read now here i want to make this statement quoting from this same article about 500 000 was at issue in this latter suit and judgmeu a was obtained in the lower court the state court of appeals howeie has now reversed the trial judge and it is not lightly to be passed over that the decision was anticipated by the entire commonwealth with knowledge that the burley society claimed to 1 own five of the seven judges the fund now sought by individual growers as being withheld from them unlawfully exceeds 2 250 000 now gentlemen i submit to the fair candid membership of this house that it is unworthy of any great paper where it knows not the facts that pretends to be a fair journal and to lay the news before the american public that they should make the outrageous scurrilous scandalous charge that five members of the supreme court were influenced in that decision because they were in the hands of our farmers organization in kentucky i pass it back and say that the charge is false and that there is no word of truth in that assertion the supreme court in no state of the union surpasses for intelligence honesty and integrity the judges of the supreme court of kentucky without regard whatever to their politics now i want to call attention further to this statement the equity society builded the larger pool on the smaller j campbell cantrill state president of the equity stumped the 45 kentucky counties which grow burley their nelghbois had raised the price of the dark leaf from 51 cents to 11 cents and better why should they take 6 cents for burley they should pool their tobacco and beat the octopus with its own weapons the trust had them now with their warehouses full they would pool the 1906 and 1907 crops grow nothing in 1908 and get more for the two years than they could have hoped to get for three three years at 6 cents would be 18 cents two years at 15 cents would be 30 cents and with the cost of the pool deducted would still be 25 cents i want you gentlemen from the western states to listen to these figures wheat in kansas returned the grower 9 29 per acre oats in iowa 9 10 barley in minnesota 15 08 corn in illinois 15 84 hay in new york 19 40 and tobacco in kentucky 90 80 mr canj rill talked a great deal of a 6cent market i heard him admit that there had been but one since the trust entered the field and the records of the cincinnati tobacco warehouse company give the equity figures the lie direct the trust said mr cantrill and his associates forced the price down from 12 cents in 1902 to 7 cents in 1905 the warehouse books quote medium leaf at 5h cents in 1897 the year before the monopoly was created 7 cents in 1902 9 87 cents in 1904 and 8 75 cents when the crop of 1907 was purchased through the pool in other words the figures given to the farmers by mr cantrill are a lie says the washington times i hurl it back and say that their statement is untrue as regards the price of tobacco before our farmers organized i beg to remind you that i am sensible of the proprieties and dignities of this house and will pass over such an ugly charge as that then this article undertakes to quote figures showing that my contention was not correct i want to say to the gentlemen of this house who represent farmers in their districts that for ten years before the farmers organization the price of burley tobacco did not exceed 6 cents a pound but when the farmers organized when they realized their own power and exercised their godgiven right when 6 cents was below the cost of production we have since sold millions of dollars worth of this tobacco through the organization almost up to a hundred millions in the last three years at an average price of 17 cents per pound six cents a pound meant want and woe and misery about the fireside in the old kentucky home seventeen cefts a pound means plenty prosperity education of the poor boys and girls in kentucky who under the 6cent tobacco were in the tobacco fields six months out of the year the serfs and slaves of the american tobacco company i lay these facts before the house and leave them at the bar of public opinion i desire to call attention to the fact that what the people of kentucky have done is strongly in accordance with the recommendation that was sent to this congress a year or so ago by expresident roosevelt because we have worked upon the plan of cooperation and the country life commission and president roosevelt in his message that i hold in my hand says that the only chance that the farmers of this nation have to protect ourselves is first by cooperation wekentucky farmers have taken him at his word we have cooperated we have stood together and we are standing together today and we will stand together unless the power of this federal government is brought upon us to crush us down and to drive us back into the dust wherefrom we have raised ourselves i appeal to the president of the united states i appeal to the department of justice i appeal to this house and to the senate of the united states to see to it that we farmers in kentucky are not crushed into the dust if we are in violation of the law we want to be right the other day i called upon the attorneygeneral and i said to him that if we are operating in opposition to the law if we are doing that act which is illegal then let our attorney come before the department of justice and have pointed out to him wherein we are wrong and i stated to him that i would give him my pledge that if weare violating the law we will get right and obey the law in letter and spirit if we are in violation of law if the sherman antitrust law which i believe was designed to protect the weak and not to oppress them prevents the fruit growers and the wheat growers and the tobacco growers and the farmers of the country generally from protecting themselves if under that law we are denied the right to organize for a reasonable price upon our products then in the name of justice in the name of the american laborer and the american farmer i ask this congress to write upon the statute books a law amending the sherman antitrust law so that the farmers and laborers of the country may exercise the right of protection from the great trusts of the country there is one other statement by innuendo to which i desire to call particular attention i read from the article it is well to remember also that the counsel for the burley society includes one republican united states senator and one democratic governor of a state north of the ohio which would mean a contrary leadership before the bar of public opinion in those states to say the least what does that statement mean that the republican senator from kentucky senator bradley is owned by this concern and that he proposes because of that ownership to stand and defend the farmers of kentucky i want to say to the membership of this house that i have known senator bradley since i was a child and although he differs radically from me in politics that no man ever sat on the floor of the united states senate who has done more to protect the interests of the tobacco growers in kentucky and in the nation than has senator bradley and i want to put that plainly before the people of this country i desire to deal justice to every man who has helped us be he democrat or republican there is no politics in this proposition i desired this opportunity of saying a word of tribute and a word of love on behalf of the great tobaedo growers of kentucky200 000 strong and moreto the gallant senator who has stood by us in our fight there is one other statement to which i desire to call attention and i will read it because i want to show the selfishness of this thing i want to show you where it comes from one of the strong points that the prosecution will try to bring out is that the equity society is in restraint of trade and that cincinnati in particular has suffered severely because of the fact that instead of bringing their tobacco to this market the growers have built warehouses of their own the independent tobacco men are backing the national authorities in the suit and their

they would not cringe or crawl before the arbitrary power of the speaker and his house machine plenty of proof is at hand let me cite an example or two the distinguished gentleman from wisconsin was nmde chairman of the committee on insular affairs by speaker henderson at the urgent request of president mckinley because the chief executive desired a man at the head of that great committee who would not permit the exploitation of the philippine islands what was done to him by the present speaker what as done to mr fowler mr norris mr haugen and many others the speaker did not hesitate to swing the headsmans ax nor the regulars to rejoice when an insurgents head fell into the basket the gentleman from new york says we have grievances aye we have and many but the gentleman does not state that these grievances arose after we had begun this fight on the speakers power and for the restoration of representative goverinent in the house the gentleman well knows that we are not seeking selfinterest we are fighting for the right of free fair and full representation in this body for our respective constituencies the socalled insurgent republican represents as good citizenship as the regular does the 200 000 or more citizens of the second district of wisconsin have some rights of representation here under our constitution but what is that right under the despotic rules of this body merely the privilege to approve the will of a representative from another state invested with despotic power under artificial unfair and selfmade rules of procedure we know indeed by bitter experience what representation means under these rules it means that we must stand by the speaker right or wrong or suffer the fate that we have endured let no one accuse us therefore of an alliance with democracy for unworthy purposes we are fighting with our democratic brethren for the common right of equal representation in this house and for the right of way of progressive legislation in congress and we are going to fight on at any cost until these inestimable rights have been redeemed for the people the gentleman eloquently appealed to the spirit of party i appeal to the spirit of country let me call the gentlemans attention to that part of george washingtons farewell address in which le speaks of the spirit of party and the despotisin it may lead to if unchecked looking with prophetic eye into the future scanning the reefs and rocks upon which the new ship of state might founder he sounded this warning to us and to unborn generations of americans hear his words i have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally the spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind it exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism this spirit of revenge natural to party dissension of which washington warns us has played its part in the creation of these rules and the parliamentary precedents that sustain the speakers despotic power i have had the opportunity and the desire to investigate this subject and i pause here to say that the rules in themselves are not so objectionable but that a few changes might work wonders if it were not for the mass of complicated inconsistent and arbitrary decisions that have grown up some of them even contradicting the rules in express terms and all tending to enlarge the importance of the presiding officer and to lessen the representative power of the house the history of the rules as studied under the light of the precedents proves that they have grown up under the united influences of party spirit and selfinterest and thus has gradually been formed in the speakers office the despotism from which we are now in open rebellion how vividly speaker reed when he was once in the minority pictured the workings of this system even in its infancy and youth how the few the speaker and his lieutenants intreuched in the forms and usages the combination and concert of old members kifowing the rules could keep the many entirely out of control govern tie house perpetuate their own rule and thereby protect vested interests and vested wrongs the eloquent gentleman from new york says the majority must control but what is the majority speaker reed emphatically said there is no greater fallacy than this idea that majority and minor ity are predicated of political parties only why should the subject of the rules be a party matter at what convention did the republican party adopt the present rules of the ilouse the speaker says he represents the majority but how he and his chief lieutenantsfavorites or personal friends a small minority within the majority call themselves the party and then pass the word on to the rank and file of the republican membership to line up or be punished what is the controlling force party principles no the speakers power under the ruleshis patronage the appointment of all committees the 56 desirable chairmanships the control of recognition on the floor the close corporation of the committee on rules consisting of the speaker himself and his two assistantsall these forces unite to form an autocracy against which we are in rebellion today we are no less republicans because we would be free members of congress we do not need to be kept in leading strings we are free representatives of the people and we want freedom here for every member of every party i wish to read a few more words from washingtons farewell address but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolnte power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition tothe purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty wi thout looking forward to an extremity of this kindwhich nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sightthe common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it it serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration it agitates the community with illfounded jealousies and false alarms kindles the animosity of one part against another foments occasionally riot and insurrection there is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful cheeks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty this within certain limits is probably true and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party but in those of the popular character in governments purely elective it is a spirit not to be encouraged from their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it a fire not to be quenched it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warming it should consume these words of washington make it clear that party spirit and not patriotism sustains the speakers autocracy love of party is good love of country is better the right should stand before reelection and so believing many of us have chosen to accept ostracism here from place and power and to risk defeat at home to change these rules has not the press been filled with the direst threats inspired by the powers that be opponents are to be brought out against us patronage to be taken away and campaign funds to be used to effect our defeat and all this because we would not bend our necks to the speakers yoke but the house machine is not the republican party we have no cause to fear the people are with us now that the issue has been presented now that the opportunity is at hand to amend these rules in one vital respect let us do so and perhaps help save the republican party if we go home to our constituents and tell them that these rules are still in force and that they are to stay in force what will be their verdict if we liberalize these rules now if we change them by enlarging the committee on rules and disqualifying the speaker from membership upon it as is proposed by the pending resolution to that extent we eliminate this issue from the campaign and what is vastly more important we make it easier to secure progressive legislation in the house redeem our platform pledges and prove our party faithful to its high trust the gentleman from new york has read a letter by president roosevelt which he seeks to construe as an indorsement of the work of the house under these rules and the present speaker this letter was written four years ago for campaign purposes it is true that the railway rate bill the purefood bill and the meatinspection bill had been favorably acted upon by congress but is there a man here who does not know that these great measures for the betterment of conditions among the people were forced through this house by the big stick in spite of the rules and the speaker ido not wish to violate any of the proprieties but i know that president roosevelt gave a subsequent indorsement under the promise that his policies would be enacted into lawa promise that was never performed i know something of the feelhigs and thoughts of one president although the impropriety of relating a conversation with him prevents me from giving them expression i will say however as an offset to what the gentleman would have us believe that there will be no cominendation in my judgment for these rules either from the former president or for that matter by the present one i feel deeply on this subject i have long been interested in it i believe i can say ithout immodesty that i was the first republican to raise this issue before the congress and before the country more than two years ago after having studied the history of our rules and what others have said on this subject and after making comparison with the parliamentary practices of other nations i first discussed these rules in a public address before my constituents and then at the first session of the sixtieth congress i deliberately sought to make their revision a paramount national issue unceasingly persistently and selfsacrificingly i have labored to bring this issue to a head and i rejoice that the

may 30 addressed to me has had my very careful consideration as i have been a silent student of the subjects referred to for several years for some time i have been aware of the fact that some of our most progressive manufacturers look upon a high import duty on cotton goods as being of great benefit to southern manufacturers never having been able to apply reason and common sense to this view i am glad of the opportunity to ask you a few questions which seem to me to present great difficulties in reconciling reason with a protective tariff on the class of cotton goods made in the south i can fully understand how a high tariff made new england rock ribbed at the expense of the balance of the country but this was when there were not enough mills in the country to supply the home markets and it was necessary to import a certain amount of goods to supply the deficiency at home and the price paid for these goods in the foreign markets plus the imu ort duty fixed the price at which these goods could be sold in the nited states now since we have more mills in the united states and manufacture more goods than can be consumed at home and to keep our mills running must find a foreign market for a portion of our products now can an import duty benefit will mr mcninch by reason of his alliance with the special interests be able to combine the mills at home so they may sell their products to the home trade at a high price and the surplus to the foreign markets at a low price or will mr mcninch be sufficiently powerful to compel foreign countries to buy our goods at a high price notwithstanding they could buy the same goods much cheaper in other countries not hampered by unjust laws as we are are you sure that your fear of an alliance between new england and the west to further oppress the south has not got its foundation in the fact that new england with her proverbial shrewdness has seen the west drifting from her pet scheme of protection it having been declared publicly by republican politicians in the east that the duty on wheat corn and other farm products was put in the tariff for no other purpose than to blind the western farmer into voting the republican ticket now are you not sure that new england is not trying to blind you with fears of the alliance and thus get you to help blind the cottonmill men of the south into voting the republican ticket as they have blinded the western farmer for more than thirty years and thus make up the losses they are sure to sustain in the west why has england for the last few months been buying nearly all the cotton even at the high prices and running her mills on full time and finding a ready market for her manufactured goods giving regular employment to labor while the american mills of the south are stopped or running at short time and at a loss many of our mill villages being in sore distress notwithstanding that the republican party guaranteed the full dinner pail and to stay full under a high tariff and a republican administration why was the year 1895 under the wilsongorman tariff bill and a democratic administration one of the most prosperous in the cottonmill business the south has ever had and why have the last two years been the most disastrous though under the highest tariff on cotton goods ever known and a republican administration as a number of cotton mills in the south are equipped for making export goods and usually sell their entire products in foreign countries and as these mills as well as all the other cotton mills of the south must pay a greatly enhanced and fictitious price by reason of a protective tariff on their machinery supplies oils etc and also on the living expenses of their operatives why is the protective tariff not a great burden to these manufacturers will you name a single mill in the ninth congressional district that is selling its goods at a higher price than the markets of the world will command answering the above questions in

perkins from that day until his last illness my relations with him were close and cordial he seemed to me then and he seems to me now to have been an ideal legislator he was a hard student and brought to any discussion in which he was engaged thorough preparation he was devoid of affectation and if any question arose upon which he could not speak authoritatively he frankly said so as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs he was exceedingly generous to his colleagues and they not only had respect for his abilities but affection for his character he was ideally equipped for his position at the head of the foreign affairs committee his scholarly qualities his historical studies and his experience abroad all conspired to make him a peculiarly efficient chairman of his committee he was a lawyer of note an author of distinction and a wellrounded man in all respects his sense of duty was keen and though already a sick man he remained in the house until the diplomatic appropriation bill was passed urged by several of his colleagues to go away for a rest he insisted upon remaining here until the bill was finally passed by the house no worn and wounded soldier by sheer force of will ever engaged in battle with more courage than did jaies breck perkins when he led the fight in support of the last diplomatic appropriation bill no chairman of a great committee during my service here has handled with more tact or more ability or more patience a bill reported from a committee than did this sick man on the very last day of his service in the house and this too though it was the first diplomatic appropriation bill of which he had been in charge the house and the country will miss him much but outside of his family no one will miss him quite so much i venture to say as the members of the committee on foreign affairs whose full confidence he had and whose affections he had won iis was a charmingpersonality cultured genial and sym pathetic everybody with whom he came in contact was his friend it has appeared since his death that he was destined to an important ambassadorship it is a strange coincidence that he like one of his predecessors robert r hitt died just as his career was about to round itself out in the service ob his country as his countrys representative abroad and no one can doubt that both would have served in that capacity with honor to their country and with added luster to themselves james breck perkins died in his prime to the observer it appeared that many useful yearsmore useful perhaps than any in his successful careerlay before him his untimely death shocked all but who can say that this was an ill to him the longest life is so brief that a few years more or less on earth matter not the psalmist says the days of our years are three score years and ten and if by reason of strength they be four score years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away we lament the death of him whom we called our friend but not so much on his account as on our own it is those who survive who have our keenest sympathy not him who has gone from our midst he who dies as perkins died has fought a good fight and won a final victory but to his family and friends the world will never be quite the same again and so today our hearts go out especially to the widow of this lovable and distinguished man who fought beside him with courage equal to his own until the final summons came our sympathies are with her today for it is true that he finished his career as every brave and loyal gentleman would wish and is safe in the hands of almighty god but she who traveled by his side during the pilgrimage of many years must now pursue her way alone may god bless her in these lonely hours of her anguish"],

in a reasonable scope for the court to rule on and all these five judges can be assigned at once on different cases now my third reason for it is this they say there will be no work before the court let me point out that under this bill if the longandshorthaul clause be adopted almost every rate in the united states will be changed if the provision under section 13 as to bonds and stocks be adopted there will be numerous decisions of this commission with reference to what bonds or stocks may be issued and all these complicated questions are to come before the court for decision there will be plenty to do if onethird of the provisions of this bill go into effect and we need the best and most careful court that can be got only one word more let it be a court not a commission let it

reference to cotton gambling contracts and prohibits the transmission of such messages by wire or through the postoffice i believe that under the constitution of the united states we have the power to enact such a law there is no question that under the decisions that may be read by the supreme court of the united states congress has a right to regulate interstate commerce in the way of messages transmitted over the telegraph line extending from one state to and into another state but outside of the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce of telegraph companies the business can be regulated by congress because under the act of 1866 a copy of which i hold in my hand and which i will read every telegraph company in order to carry on its interstate business to establish new lines or conduct its business over the postroads and navigable streams and the public domain was obliged to come in and accept the terms of that act on the 24th of july 1866 congress passed the following act an act to aid in the construction of telegraph lines and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal military and other purposes be it enacted etc that any telegraph company now organized or which may hereafter be organized under the laws of any state in this union shall have the right to construct maintain and operate lines of telegraph through and over any portion of the public domain of the united states over and along any of the military or postroads of the united states which have been or may hereafter be declared such by act of congress and over under or across the navigable streams or waters of the united states provided that such lines of telegraph shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct the navigation of such streams and waters or interfere with the ordinary travel on such military or postroads and any of said companies shall have the right to take and use from such public lands the necessary stone timber and other materials for its posts piers stations and other needful uses in the construction maintenance and operation of said lines of telegraph and may preempt and use such portion of the unoccupied public lands subject to preemption through which its said lines of telegraph may be located as may be necessary for its stations not exceeding 40 acres for each station hut such stations shall not be within 15 miles of each other spe 2 and be it further enacted that telegraphic communications between the several departments of the government of the united states and their officers and agents shall in their transmission over the lines of any of said companies have priority over all other business and shall be sent at rates to be annually fixed by the postmastergeneral sec 3 and be it further enacted that the rights and privileges hereby granted shall not be transferred by any company acting under this act to any other corporation association or person provided however that the united states may at any time after the expiration of five years from the date of the passage of this act for postal military or other purposes purchase all the telegraph lines property and effects of any or all of said companies at an appraised value to be ascertained by five competent disinterested persons two of whom shall be selected by the postmastergeneral of the united states two by the company interested and one by the four so previously selected sec 4 and be it further enacted that before any telegraph company shall exercise any of the powers or privileges conferred by this act such company shall file
