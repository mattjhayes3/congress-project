their new freedom all remind us that spring is here almost before we know it will come june the month of roses blushing brides and secret new deal conclaves on islands in the chesapeake bay it hardly seems possible that almost a year has passed since the last secret conclave on jefferson island which you will recall was held june 25 26 and 27 no one has ever revealed to me the real reason why jefferson island was selected for that famous concordat of peace but it must have been because the island was named after the traditional father of the democratic party whose concepts of government have long been forgotten possibly it was just a nice gesture to the memory of those jeffersonian principles at any rate the conclave was held and although it did not produce any apparent beneficial results there was talk at that time of making it an annual event with that in mind i rise today to suggest that this years conclave if one is to be held be staged on solomons island also in the chesapeake bay if there is any virtue in environment heaven knows the new dealers need all the benefits that might flow from discourse on solomons island another reason why solomons island should be the scene of this years conclave is that this administration of government is about as far removed from the reputed wisdom of solomon as the new deal governmental policies are removed from jeffersonian concepts of constitutional government but i had another reason for taking the floor today i desire to discuss facts in connection with the national debt president roosevelt has had 5 years of unsurpassed public support unprecedented cooperation by the congress unparalleled control of government of public expenditures and unquestioned discretion in spending great sums of money and now we find ourselves in the depths of the abyss of depression as deeply as we were the day the new deal moved into washington not only are we back in the depression but by 1940 the national debt will have grown to more than 40 000 000 000 now 40 000 000 000 means little to the average fellows mind it is a sum of money so stupendous that the human mind cannot grasp the significance of the numerals necessary to express it it seems to me that we may perhaps get a better grasp of just where we have landed after 5 years of the new dealwith our 40 000 000 000 debt and no relief in sightif we try to translate this sum of money into more understandable images which the human mind can visualize you will recall that several months ago that political genius james a farley conceived a great idea for replenishing the democratic national committees war chest the idea was to take obsolete democratic campaign books worth about 10 cents each as waste paper and by having president roosevelt personally autograph some 2 500 sheets of paper to be inserted in the books promptly raise the sale value to an amount as great in some instances as 10 000 per copy according to the figures i have obtained mr farley up to may 31 1937 sold 1 688 of these obsolete campaign books for a total sum of 720 524 64 or an average of 426 85 per book now in order to get some grasp of what this federal indebtedness of 40 000 000 000 by 1940 means i have somewhat laboriously worked the thing out in terms of obsolete democratic campaign books to pay off this enormous debt if mr farley chose to do sowhich he will notit would require at an average price of 426 85 the stupendous number of 93 733 1611 2 democratic campaign booksautographed to clarify this let us assume that president roosevelt could maintain an average speed of 10 autographs per minute he would be require to spend 9 373 3611 2 minutes writing his famous autograph to put in these books if the debt were to be paid in that manner now 9 373 3161 2 minutes equal 156 222 hours this number of hours equals 19 528 days of 8 working hours each of course we all know that president roosevelt does not spend every working hour at his desk we know that he spends a considerable portion of his time fishing in fact i recall during the supreme court controversy it was disclosed that the president at that time had been absent from his desk about 40 percent of the time if that figure is correct then mr roosevelt spends an average of 219 working days a year at the white house on that basis if he did nothing but write his famous autographs each dayat the rate of 8 hours each daywithout stopping for nourishmentand no president could be expected to work harder than thatit would take president roosevelt 19 528 days or 53 2 years in which to autograph enough democratic campaign books in order to pay off the national debt now there is another way out provided of course the presidents strength holds out and his popularity did not wane too greatly over the years it has been currently reported that mr roosevelt has sold to a certain newspaper syndicate his obsolete press conference notes apparently the president figured that if jim farley could sell obsolete democratic campaign books he the president could sell his obsolete press conference notes anyway he decided to try it and apparently has met with success there has been a good deal of somewhat pointed if unkind criticism about the sale of these obsolete press conference notes but finally one of mr roosevelts secretariesstrangely enough named earlyvery belatedly announced that the president has no intention of keeping the money derived from the sale of these notes according to the belated announcement of mr early the president is going to give the money to the government the exact purpose not being disclosed now it may be that mr roosevelt has conceived the idea of paying off the national debt by the sale of these obsolete press conference notes if he has that in mind it would figure out somewhat like this it is generally reported now that the presidents total receipts from the sale of these obsolete press conference notes will be in the neighborhood of 50 000 on that basis the president would have to have 800 000 batches of obsolete press conference notes in order to pay off our 40 000 000 000 national debt figured on the basis of one press conference a week the president has held 260 press conferences in the 5 years he has been in office this means that each press conference gave rise to a batch of obsolete press conference notes worth 192 on the basis of each batch being worth 192 it would require 280 333 333 press conferences to provide enough obsolete press conference notes to pay off the national debt on the basis of holding one press conference a week the president will have to remain in office 4 006 410 years and 3 months in order to hold enough press conferences to pay off the indebtedness he has gotten us into with his new deal policies i intended to figure out how many trains 1 mile in length it would take to haul these obsolete democratic campaign books and these obsolete pressconference notes also how many newspapers it would require to print these obsolete pressconference notes but the figures became so astronomical in their immensity that i concluded to be content with the foregoing simple illustrations of what 40 000 000 000 really mean and what the president has gotten us into and how long it will take him to get us out i think the figures i have given make it quite apparent that it is highly advisable for the next extraordinary session of congress to be held bn solomons island in that environment we may be able to figure out how this stupendous indebtedness which has been piled up by mr roosevelt may be discharged in this period of depression recently the president took the role of a professor of economics at one of his press conferencesnot yet entirely obsolete with several charts and graphs in front of him he proceeded to give the white house correspondents a course of sprouts in new deal economics the professor was able to demonstrate by peaks and dips of the lines on his charts that prosperity is just around the corner of course he did not use that term we could hardly expect him to do that but he did point out that prosperity is just over the next hump in any event the professor demonstrated by his charts and graphs that a given number of princes of privilege added to a like number of economic royalists plus twice as many aristocratic anarchists equals one depression he also demonstrated very clearly that one new deal bureaucracy plus 1 000 new deal theories plus 1 000 broken promises equal one national debt of 40 000 000 000 i have now demonstrated to youand i hope very clearlythat 93 722 1611 2 obsolete democratic campaign books plus an equal number of presidential autographs plus 5312 years of the roosevelt administration would equal the national debt of 1940 provided however mr roosevelt spends no more money i concede however that my calculation is completely erroneous because it would be impossible for mr roosevelt to remain in office without spending a lot of money the president has on one occasion expressed a good deal of contempt for the horse and buggy days but in looking over my figures you will have to admit that he has taken this nation for a nice buggy ride at any rate those old horse and buggy days were thrifty days a dollar was a dollar in those days and in those horse and buggy days a national annual expenditure of a billion dollars was regarded as something incredible in 5 years mr roosevelt has expended somewhere between fortyfive and fifty billion dollars just to get us into another depression so of course we could not expect him to be sympathetic with the thrifty horse and buggy days such days as those are entirely foreign to mr roosevelts exuberant nature his characteristically optimistic view of things is such as to make him ever ready to enjoy the pleasure of lavish spendingdown to the taxpayers last dollar apparently mr roosevelt has never paused to consider the amount of perspiration involved in the production of a bushel of corn or a bale of cotton those are mere sweaty details his is a grandiose view he loves to deal in millions of bales of cotton and to discuss millions of bushels of corn forgetting and ignoring the miles which must be trudged along the dusty furrows in order to produce those millions of bales of cotton and those millions of bushels of corn speaking of cotton corn and perspiration let me observe that mr roosevelt is not wholly insensible to the sweat of labor someone said recently on the floor of this house that mr roosevelt never did any hard work i cannot agree with that it must have been hard work indeed to think up all the promises he has madejust to think them upto say nothing of attempting to fulfill them on one occasion the president having in mind undoubtedly the sweat he had seen roll from the faces of those whom he watched at their labors said taxes are paid in the sweat of every man who labors if excessive they are reflected in idle factories taxsold farms and hence in hordes of the hungry trampiig the streets and seeking jobs in vain our workers may never ee a tax bill but they pay in deductions from wages in increased costs of what they buy or as now in broad cessation of employment our people and our business cannot carry its excessive burdens of taxation of course what mr roosevelt said in october 1932 was entirely correct and 0 brethren how he has made the people of this country sweat under taxes ever since back in the days when mr roosevelt was telling us how he was going to borrow and spend us out of the depression he gave us the assurance that from time to time he would set up his trusty microphone and give us a fireside chat he did so many of them it is true that the more he chatted the nearer he took us to a relapse into the depression now we are there since we have been in his depression however there has been a strange absence of fireside chats today somewhere between eleven and twelve million unemployed wage earners are sitting beside their fireless firesides with their cookless cookers on cold kitchen stoves waiting for mr roosevelt to give them another fireside chat they want him to tell them where to find jobs during this depression throughout this nation these unemployed wage earners and their families are waiting for a word of encouragement and incidentally these wage earners and their families are earnestly hoping that such a chat will not be sponsored by some enterprising cigarette manufacturer or breakfastfood producer what a poignant thing it would be brethren and sisters for those unemployed wage earners and their families hungry and penniless to have to listen to the virtues of some toothsome breakfast food extolled at the beginning and end of a fireside chat what a poignant thing it would be for those eleven or twelve million unemployed wage earners penniless and desolate denied the solace of a pipe or cigarette to have to listen to a message extolling the delights of a certain brand of cigarettes before and after a fireside chat such sponsored broadcasts and such advertising devices are not now far removed from the president himself will not mr roosevelt again take up his trustyor should i say rustymicrophone and tell these eleven or twelve million unemployed wage earners and their families where we are going from herewhere they can turn for hope willnot mr roosevelt tell bewildered and fearful businessmen what they may expect as the policy of the government toward business for at least the next 12 months will not mr roosevelt tell the taxpayers of america who are staggering under the present enormous burden when how and if ever they are to get relief will not mr roosevelt go to solomons island and from there perhaps inspired by his environment tell us all how we are to get out of this mess he has gotten us into brethren and sisters this is not criticism it is an earnest plea"], [0.013168931007385254,

receiving the substantial relief which was promised a study of the bill indicates in many instances that the tax burden will actually be increased the measure on the whole completely misses the

minimize or avert a major depression from which we may never be able to pull ourselves out and to promote greater economic wellbeing for our own people and in fact the people of the whole world the committee says any cause for hesitation on the part of business to go forward so far as taxes are concerned should now disappear i say that business does not receive from this bill the full assurance it needs to restore confidence and start the wheels of industry turning again credit must be given the committee for skillful advocacy of its proposals and for its outstanding technical presentation of new and farreaching complexities for example the proposals on capital gains and losses provide for further hardship and complexity by completely segregating longterm and shortterm transactions so that losses on one cannot be offset by gains on the other and by monthbymonth percentages and an optional method of figuring the tax that make it even more objectionable than at present credit must also be given the committee for recognizing some of the evils of the undistributedprofits tax and for relieving some corporations from payment that is not enough all corporations regardless of size or amount of income should be treated alike the tax should be repealed outright remember this is the tax that the experts of the treasury prophesied would prevent depressions it has encouraged the present business decline the committee however not only retains the undistributed profits tax principle but actually proposes a penalty tax of 20 percent on undistributed profits of closely held or familyowned corporations while the chairman alleges the purpose of providing relief yet in this case he proposes additional taxes elsewhere he suggests aid to small business yet in this case he arbitrarily selects corporations with an income of 75 000 on which this new tax would be imposed this new tax is in addition to the normal tax which has already been paid by the corporation no satisfactory explanation has yet been offered by the committee why one of the most useful and important groups of business enterprises in this country should be discriminated against in this manner get after by all means a few culprits who abuse their privileges under the guise of closely held corporations but do not spread out a huge umbrella and cover and visit upon the innocent decent family corporation unprecedented and prohibitive tax punishment no real consideration of the effects or consequences of revenue measures now in force is reflected by this bill no recognition is made of the fact that individual savings and business savings are the two things that sustain business life no consideration is given to the fact that investment is the sole means of increasing employment and every thinking person must be concerned about the employment situation in our land today throughout the bill the technical point of view of a tax authority appears to have controlled the undistributedprofits tax generally and the high capitalgains tax specifically spell greater unemployment they have cost millions of jobs these taxes militate against investments the plotted curve of investments parallels the curve of rise and fall of jobs what we need in this country right now is the spirit of enterprise we must put men to work and restore the weakened morale of the nation we need courage to face the facts and confidence to assume normal legitimate business risks there has been too much uncertainty suspicion and fear unfortunately this new tax bill offers little to allay this condition this bill lays greater emphasis on the amount of money that must be raised than on the means that should be employed for that purpose we are all agreed that the government must raise money to operate but the way to raise this money in large quantities is to incorporate in our taxing system the policies which will increase our national income reasonable fair and equitable tax rates will not only increase our national income but will also provide the necessary revenue requirements for government operations this congress should not let such an opportunity slip through its fingers despite all my objections however i still think that the committee did a good job their task was herculean the complexities enormous in due course i intend to offer an amendment to strike out in its

factories highspeed machines in large factories will be further mechanized for replacement of men to be sure no new jobs will be created by this bill the only real effect of same will be to destroy jobs in great sections of our country and increase jobs in new and large monopolistic industries and centers in new england after all i know that one section of our great country cannot and should not

clerks horticulturists livestock raisers poultry people packers of agricultural products of different kinds outside salesmen seamen on merchants ships those engaged in taking fish and sea foods in fact the bill excludes every worker in intrastate business of all kinds such as work in laundries and other local factories and business not doing an interstate business why burden all these people with excess cost of their needs by fixing a set wage and lesser hours accruing to benefit of large industrial establishments and their labor in new england states this bill singles out interstate laborers as a class to give them higher wages and shorter hours all intrastate laborers are given nothing whatever they are left with the same wage same hours and are forced to help bear the burdens of increased wages and so forth of laborers in interstate commerce we pay no milliondollar bonuses to capitalists and industrialists in the south our industry is all of small capital we pay no 100 000 250 000 500 000 and 1 000 000 salaries in the south we know that such salaries and bonuses are paid in hundreds and hundreds of these large concerns in the north and east this bill will enable such concerns to maintain and increase such salaries at the expense of southern and western industry and labor pay rolls are met with money from bank deposits they cannot be met without money these pay rolls are met from demand deposits in our banks the state of new york has around 750 demand deposits for each man woman and child in that state in our state and many other southern western and

of new jersey there is seven times as much money available for labor in demand deposits as in arkansas in connecticut where the population is 250 000 less than in arkansas the demand deposits are two and a half times that of arkansas no southern state has attained anywhere near a high per capita demand deposits as these new england industrial states american wages must of necessity vary widely

raw materials we produce a million and a half bales of cotton per year and manufacture less than five thousand of it we have some of the finest labor eager and anxious for a job many other states are similarly equipped i am just wondering why one should vote to raise the price of what farmers laborers and other southern and western consumers have to buy in order to further help new england capital monopolies and large industrial corporations and their labor in the new england states why should one vote to further handicap if not destroy labor and industry of his own section to build up and further centralize and monopolize industry in the north and east why vote to further cripple his schools in obtaining revenues why vote to foreclose all chance to obtain new industries for our southern and western labor and revenue for our schools the children in new england and certain northern states receive on an average 75 each per year for school purposes while in the south due to lack of taxes on industry our children have an average of about 25 why should one vote against giving his own people a fair opportunity to get an education and obtain jobs in factories and increase school facilities of children of the people he represents why should one vote to impose further burdens and excess cost of manufactured products upon the fathers and mothers of these children in order to aid the capitalists monopolists and large industrial corporations in the new england states after all why deceive labor why put him in restrict and accustom him to this low wage and hour scale if he has a family a laborer cannot live in a large city on 25 cents per hour certainly he cannot have any of the conveniences and luxuries of modern inventions anywhere on such a wage why not show some courage and work for a wage that will enable him to have not only the necessities but some of the luxuries furthermore in some cities and sections rents and living expenses are higher than in other sections in some cities educational and other advantages are more and better than in others in some cities workers are compelled to pay transportation to reach their work under this bill instead of decentralizing industry and scattering it over the country so that all may have a chance it will centralize industry electricity is the motive power of industry today and can be transmitted to where the raw materials resources and laborers are instead of transporting the raw material under this bill laborers will be forced to migrate in large numbers to the large industrial cities where frightful labor conditions already exist then i hesitate to contemplate the result again this fixing of labors minimum wage cannot but please great capitalists and financiers of america they control these large industrial plants railroads and monopolies they control the banking facilities i can assure you that at one meeting and one stroke of the pen these financiers can make 25 cents an hour equal in purchasing power to 15 cents they can make 40 cents per hour equal 25 cents this can result by changing the purchasing power of the dollar the slightest lowering of the discount rate by the bankers can lower and destroy this fixed wage the lowering of bankreserve requirements will have the same tendency and effect the slightest expansion of the currency or credit will lower this fixed wage nothing will please the great financiers of america more than to place the american laborer in a strait jacket of a fixed wage variable at their will there is no stability in the value of a dollar nor of its purchasing power in america today until such purchasing power of the dollar be more nearly stabilized there can be no fixed wage and we shall continue to have depressions in truth this bill turns over to the great northern capitalists financiers and industrialists the fixing of labors wage through their control of credit and money this bill and the principle involved surrender to the financiers and large industrialists labors rights to contract and bargain why not remedy first the fundamental cause of our economic troubles our whole trouble is caused by undue expansion or contraction of money and credit instability of purchasing and debtpaying power of the dollar i submit if we are going to fix a minimum wage for some laborers then fix minimum wage or price for the farmer and his products why not help him and his family because his sweatshop requires as much hard work perspiration and longer hours than any other sweatshop in this country if the farmer be given a fair price the industrial laborer will prosper if congress under this law can fix minimum wage it can fix maximum wage and price on all things in interstate commerce or having to do with interstate commerce if congress can fix minimum or maximum wage under this bill then it can fix minimum or maximum salaries for all business in the united states i submit that when all this great business is turned over to some bureau or secretary in washington to manage to define what is and is not interstate commerce then we have destroyed individual rights collective rights state rights constitutional rights and substituted the dictates of man for law and the constitution in some sections of this country we have droughts floods calamities and other sectional crop failures and disasters yet under this bill as to wages no relief can be given the same wage must be paid as in the great rich industrial sections of north and east when it comes to w p a or p w a jobs or relief in the south what is the attitude of these humanitarians who shed glycerin tears so copiously for southern labor well they give him just about onehalf various advocates of this bill argue in effect that the southern laborer out of a job and hungry is less hungry than a new york or pennsylvania laborer and that the one should receive 21 per month while the other 40 to 55 per month they argue that it is a kind of dole or charity out of federal treasury anyway and we will penalize him because of his helplessness this bill now before us contemplates a worse discrimination even than that it is my opinion that the title of this bill should read a bill for an act in the interest of and to help create more monopolies aid the financiers and controllers of large industry place labor and its fixed wage under their control through control of money and credit regiment labor and industry take away from labor the right to contract individually or collectively cripple if not destroy present southern labor and industry prevent further industry locating in south west or midwest deprive citizens in fourfifths of the country of jobs and opportunities for jobs further deprive the children of southern western and midwestern parents of educational advantages fair share of industrial taxes and wealth occupational opportunities and for other discriminatory purposes arkansas already has one of the best childlabor laws in the union as well as protective laws for women in industry the real remedy for our labor situation for industry for farmers and all the people is to bring down the value of the gold dollar to the purchasing value of the dollar of 1926 and to maintain and stabilize that parity or basis and then legislate wages the currencies of other nations are disorganized disarranged out of kelter and we suffer because still tied to gold on an unfair ratio or basis as to dollar value i submit it is impossible to pass a fair honest and nondiscriminatory labor bill in this congress now or to amend the one before us such a bill i would support we have some bad labor conditions in the south and you have worse conditions in the north and the northeast but it is not wise to kill a patient in order to cure him i do not believe that the president can approve this bill because he says that no reasonable person seeks a complete uniformity in wages in every part of the united states i believe in the presidents great humanitarian objects i do not believe he would knowingly commit an injustice or perpetrate a wrong upon any section of this country for the benefit of another section of the country i do not believe he will agree to a bill that will foster monopolies by giving them an advantage at the expense of small industrial plants of this nation some of the rest of you may defy him but at all times on all votes that i may cast in this house i shall be reasonable and make every effort to be just and fair to all and within the constitution which i swore to uphold protect
