would like to concur with the gentleman completely that the fpc has already stated there are other potential pump storage sites which could provide the peaking power at lower cost than the blue ridge project theonly way they balance out a costbenefit ratio is to say that it is needed for recreation if the gentleman will yield further what the gentleman from north carolina says about the recreational potential for the river as it is and of course freeflowing streams in this country are becoming increasingly scarce it way exceeds anything that would be created with a manmade lake that will go up and down 10 feet we just cannot improve on nature and create a recreational resource i hope this will be supported by the entire membership i would like to pay particular tribute to the chairman the gentleman from north carolina and his colleague from that state for bringing this legislation to the floor i would also like to commend my colleague from west virginia for his extraordinarily effective work promoting this bill my office is down the hall from his every day during this session i have observed the sign on his door reading the new riverlike it is that is the way we should assure it remains i would like to point out the dubious nature of the recreation benefits claimed for the proposed blue ridge project by its proponents i have always been a strong champion of sound recreation resource development however i question the soundness of blue ridge first of all we must realize that pump storage projects such as blue ridge are not designed primarily for recreation they are designed to store power and are drained periodically to release the power when this occurs the water level subsides and unsightly mud flats occur around the lake even if this should occur infrequently as aep claims it does introduce an uncertainty about recreation which might affect the recreational value of the project in addition since fish and other aquatic species lay their eggs in shallow water we cannot be certain that fishing would continue to be productive currently the new river is one of the best smallmouth bass fisheries in the nation the american electric power co has admitted that there are alternative sites which could produce power more cheaply than the blue ridge project they have justified selecting the more expensive blue ridge site by claiming that it will become a major recreational attraction in the southeastern united states with an annual average attendance of over 6 million people experts have raised good questions as to why 6 million people would single out blue ridge when there are numerous flatwater reservoirs nearby why would people bypass one two or in some cases three recreational reservoirs to visit one such as blue ridge where they might face mudflatsof up to 50 feetsurrounding the water i have here a letter dated august 3 sent to the house rules committee by the top recreation professional in north carolina mr ron johnson director of state parks and recreation our planning staff has been involved with reservoir aid state park studies for at least five years a summary of results of studies includes the following 1 a very comprehensive study of proposed reservoirs as they relate to unmet recreation needs shows the blue ridge project reservoir number 32 in a priority listing of 83 projects in north carolina the computer printout summary is attached 2 state park lands in region d the location in which the blue ridge reservoir would be located exceed current needs by 2 648 acres as of the most recent computation july 29 1976 a summary copy of which is attached 3 the population residing within 50 miles of the proposed project is 638 000 the 50mile distance standard defines the area from which 90 of expected visitation will come accessibility within this region is such that the 50mile figure may be in excess of the effective market area because of the character of the road system the 50mile standard has been established as a result of other studies including some by unitedstates army corps of engineers 4 lake norman a 35 000acre reservoir with a population of 1 317 000 within 50 miles with a relatively stable water level on the catawba river near charlotte north carolina is attracting approximately 2 2 million visitors annually 5 as a result of state park studies the existence of mount jefferson state park in ashe county and the 12 000acre stone mountain state park in wilkes county both of which are within 35 miles of the blue ridge project will be adequate to supply the demand for state parks within this region stone mountain will eventually consist of 20 000 acres and is directly adjacent to the blue ridge parkway doughton park the thurman chatham game lands 6 924 acres and the carson woods game lands 1 079 acres in summary there is an existing surplus of the type of recreation which blue ridge might provide how could the project be a major recreational attraction in the whole southeast when it would be a very mediocre one in north carolina the new river as a wild and scenic river would be a completely unique recreational resource for a large

excellent physical education training during their school years i feel we can boil this issue down to several fundamental points do we extend to the federal government still another opportunity to thwart the power and the will of the people do we compel not only our local schools but the students themselves to accept full sex integration of their gym classes or in the case of college students fraternities as the sponsor of the amendment points out we run the risk of fostering another form of discrimination perhaps worse than the one we are trying to correct namely compelling organizations
