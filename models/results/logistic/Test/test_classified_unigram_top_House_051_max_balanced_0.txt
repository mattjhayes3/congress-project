word material but sir the source from which i derived my information was not only current rumor but the newspapers of the country as well and i have found that generally these are very accurate and reliable in reporting caucus proceedings i desire however to modify somewhat the scope of this statement for the benefit of the gentleman from ohio who questions its accuracy as i do new recall the fact that certain prominent leaders on that side according to newspaper notoriety and general understanding have indicated to members on this side of the house that the right to report general pension legislation at any time secured tothe committee on invalid pensions in that caucus ought to be stricken out and that an amendment curtailing this privilege would be promptly and favorably considered but sir so far as i have been able to understand the sontintent of this side of the house on that question i have discovered no disposition to obtrude upon the delicate domestic affairs of the republican party com nutte quonuu the first essential change which i desire to notice in the code of rules is that which reverses the practice of the house for more than a century by reducing the quorum of the committee of the whole from the constitutional quorum to a hundred members the avowed intent of this innovation is in the language of its advocates to enable the house to do business with this view i do not think that when we have reached the end of the session there will be any occasion for disappointment this change of the rule facilitates and accelerates the passage of many bills imposing burdens upon the public treasury which could not be accomplished if a constitutional quorum were required as heretofore sir i urge no claim to gifts of prophecy but unless i am greatlydeceived at the end of this session some of those who now champion this socalled reform will be found ready to advocate its repeal when confronted with the enormous aggregate of the appropriations of the session the operation of this rule is moreover likely to relieve congress of the necessity of reducing the burdens of taxation with the view at least of disposing of the surplus the surplus will have disappeared as the result of the wanton prodigality and extravagance which this rule invites and the warnings of the gentleman from illinois but so recently uttered will prove as powerless to stay that tidal wave as would have been a pebble to check the rushing flood that swept down the valley of the conemaugh and overwhelmed johnstown in ruin and desolation"],

illogical and unfair to charge this upon the claimant the discussion now is of actions for the recovery of funds from the government why sir the very decision of the court in favor of the claimant is conclusive that the government was in error or its agent or official and not the claimant that it was if anything a speculative exaction on the part of the government against the importer and therefore when we consider the course of justice in this matter it would seem to put beyond all impeachment the question of the nature of the cases under which the claim arises and a word also in regard to what has been said about the subject suing the sovereign i think no gentleman on this floor will question the fact that in any case of injustice or supposed injustice if the subject can not sue the sovereign he at least can sue the agent or official of the sovereign for exceeding his lawful powers but in this bill where the subject is so circumscribed in the court if you turn to section 24 on page 27 of the bill you will find that he is denied all power to sue the agent of the sovereign it is said sec 24 that from and after the passage of this act no collector or other officer of the customs shall be in any way liable to any owner importer consignee or agent of any merchandise or any other person for or on account of any rulings or decisions as to the classification of said merchandise or the duties charged thereon hence we pick out this class of our citizens and virtually deny them the right to sue not only the government but the right to sue the agent of the government a right that is allowed to every other citizen in the country it is also provided in this bill for a union of judicial and executive functions we find when it comes to the question of appeal the citizen can not proceed in his suit against the man who has made the illegal exaction such exactions as occur and which the courts are saying daily are illegal and yet he can not make it upon testimony except that made up by the very officials from whom he makes the appeal and when the case is made up before these officials we find that the importer is only allowed a small pittance of twentyfour hours in which to get up the salient and important parts of his testimony i am told that it is a period of five days but my personal recollection is that the amendment was defeated now sir that is the manner in which these citizens are treated they are not allowed to go to the courts with the facts they are not allowed a jury they are not allowed to appear before the lower court which consists of these executive officers who perpetrate a wrong even with counsel some of the evils which are complained of may be cured but i insist that some better remedy can be found than denying to american citizens the right of counsel the right of an exclusively judicial body the right of having time to get up their facts and to take the facts to the court and the right of a trial by jury i trust that some better remedy can be found than to strike at the very root of our liberties this can not be done in one instance without furnishing a precedent for further practice the thing for us to do is to preserve these great rights of the people unimpaired and not to mix the judicial and executive powers of this government make your laws plain and simple and where there are errors or complications still leave them for fair trial by the recognized judicial bodies and methods of a free country"], [0.022467076778411865, 0.9775329232215881, 1, "i call the attention of the house and ask to have read the following statement of the farmmortgage indebtedness of six of the great agricultural states of the west and northwest taken from the bankers monthly which ought to be good

farmmortgage indebtedness of my own state of illinois but i think it is safe to say that it is not less than that of the state of indiana and perhaps equal to that of the state of ohio the report of the state board of agriculture of illinois for the year 1889 shows that the total value of the corn crop for the year 1889 in illinois was 58 337 049 and that the total cost of the production of the same was 68 272 872 making a total loss to the farmers of illinois for the year 1889 of 9 935 823 the question is what is to become of the agricultural interests of this country if something is not done and that speedily too for its relief the time has come when class legislation must cease those who are familiar with the depressed condition of agriculture will not deny that the farmers have just righteous cause for complaint this government is ceasing to be the government of the people for the people and by the people but is becoming a government of the classes for the classes and by the classes the accumulation of large fortunes in the hands of a few individuals in many instances is the result of class legislation and government paternalism the wealth of the nation is rapidly passing into the hands of a few i hold that no man can accumulate a million of dollars in a lifetime in honest and legitimate pursuits i am therefore in favor of a graduated income tax exempting those of moderate means and increasing the tax proportionately to the income if i had my way i would make the man who owns two millions of dollars give one to keep the otler instead of making the poor and unfortunate bear the burden of taxation as is the case now this would equalize taxation and compel the millionaire to contribute his share to the support of the government every person should be permitted to have and retain the legitimate returns of his honest labor after paying his equal share to support the government but these large fortunes are not the returns of honest effort but are the accumulations of gambling schemes and class legislation little short of highway robbery made possible by unjust laws these large fortunes under our system of collecting revenue do not pay their share of the burdens of either state or federal government but the poor man whose little effects are visible is made to pay more than an equal share of taxation in the support of state and municipal governments and in support of the national government he is made to bear a still more heavy load of taxation by reason of the fact that the articles that he has to buy and consumes are more heavily taxed than the articles consumed by the millionaire i am in favor of free and unlimited coinage of silver i am in favor of increasing the circulating medium to the extent that it will be amply sufficient to meet the demands of trade these are measures of relief that should be offered at once but i am opposed to increasing the circulation of national banks 10 per cent as provided in the bill for that purpose now pending in this congress i am opposed also to loaning the surplus to national banks at all with or without interest it would be better that the government had no surplus to loan and the better way would be for the government to reduce taxes so there would be no surplus to loan the government has no use for money except sufficient to honestly and economically administer its affairs and when more money is taken from the people by which a surplus is created to be loaned or deposited with national banks it is robbery pure and simple this surplus is wrongfully taken from the people it is the peoples money and should be left with the people in the legitimate channels of trade and not given to banks to be reloaned to the people at large rates of interest it amounts to the people borrowing their own money and paying large rates of interest tothe banks and moneylenders for the privilege of using what already belongs to them by right in view of this condition of affairs the almost universal demand coming from the farmers for the abolishment of the nationalbanking system rests in reason and is founded in the law that selfpreservation is the first law of nature the practice of depositing the surplus money of the government in national banks has been justified upon the ground that it has been necessary to prevent a stringency in the money market whether the practice can be justified upon this or any other ground is a question but itis evident that the foundation of the evil is in maintaining a system that allows a surplus to any considerable extent to accumulate in the vaults of the national treasury the farmers recognize that this is not a paternal government they do not demand class legislation while a few extremists may demand bounties subsidies and class legislation viewing matters from a false standpoint the great masses view with disfavor class legislation for any interest while it has been suggested to pay bounties to the growers of wheat and corn and other class legislation has been suggested as a relief or panacea for the ills of the farmer no farmer who has studied the pernicious effect of class legislation will favor it they recognize that the people are the government and that the people must support the government all the money and wealth the government has must come from the people by taxation and any special privilege granted to a class must be by taxation and at the expense of the whole people while the farmers bear the greatest proportion of the burdens of taxation any special privileges for the farmers would be in effect taxing themselves tbr the benefit of themselves it would be like a man attempting to lift himself over the fence by his bootstraps worse than that the money would pass through the hands of a horde of official taxgatherers who would take 25 per cent and perhaps more before it would get back to the source whence it came class legislation can not be justified upon any theory consistent with honest government let us go back to first principles and have no privileged classes let every person sell the product of his toil in fair and legitimate competition in the market that will afford him the best prices and buy his necessaries in the market where he can buy the cheapest under the rules of this house by which the speaker can see a quorum you of the other side have absolute power of legislation and can pass any bill in twentyfour hours that you wish to become a law no obstructions will come from this side of the house in consideration of public measures for the relief of the people and against your will none would be available money wrung from the people by unjust taxation in excess of the needs of the government is a standing temptation to public plunder publicbuilding jobs private claims shipsubsidy grabs river and harbor steals and many other schemes to reduce the surplus have had full and unmolested sway in this congress to the exclusion of public business in the interests of the masses of the people the large and overflowing surplus in the national treasury is rapidly disappearing by the extravagant and needless expenditure of the peoples money and unless there is a change in the tendency of legislation this congress will adjourn with a deficiency with no relief to those burdened by over and excessive taxation but a demand for more taxation and more money reduce therevenues to the legitimate needs of the government stop the looters of the national treasury suppress trusts and give the plain common honest people of this country a chance give the masses of the people a chance for once and stop the unceasing and neverending grabbing of the avaricious few do this and let the farmer buy his necessaries in the same market where he is compelled to sell his surplus stop class legislation give the people free and unlimited coinage of silver make the circulating medium sufficient to meet the demands of trade put the money in circulation and stop giving it to national banks and hard times will disappear to return no more the farmer will lift the mortgage from his farm will be able to supply his family with all the comforts of life and will have money to loan instead of being compelled to borrow"], [0.024167418479919434, 0.9758325815200806, 1, "the same rules of procedure in committee of the whole were establihed as prevailed in the house except that as i have said relating to debate now we will follow that same thought alittle further and upon an examiration it will be found that within a few days thereafter and daring the same month the question of tariff legislation was acted upon and referred to a committee of the whole and debated for a long period before it was reported to the house later on in the third congress the rules were rendered somewhat more comprehensive the same jealousy on the subject of taxation and the appropriation of the public revenues which is to be found in the proceedings of our ancestors in the british house of commons is closely followed and plainly reiterated here we find in the rules no motion or proposition for a tax or charge upon the people shall be discussed upon the day it is made or offered every such proposition shall receiveits first discussion in the committee of the whole house all proceedings touching the appropriation of money shall be first moved and discussed in a committee of the vhole house the rules of proceeding in the house shall be observed in committee in so far as they may be applicable except that limiting the time of speaking etc and here sir the same doctrine is recognized that the rule of proceeding in committee of the whole required that they should have a quorum to do business just as the house is required to have a quorum before it can transact business the substance of this rule has continued from then until now in 1837 the manual of mr jefferson was added to the rules by a vote of the house and has since then been a part of the legislative code of the house of representatives but through those rules and through this long practice thereunder there has never been a question so far as the journal of the house discloses or so far as i have been able to discover in debate making any distinction between a quorum of the house and that required to transact business in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union the english authorities which i have cited might besupplemented by various others but i have not thought fit to trespass upon the patience ef the house by the recitation of authorities which are simply cumulative and especially before a body of such high intellectuality it is said by the majority reporting these rules as it has been urged elsewhere that the committee of one hundred is authorized by the constitution that a committee of the whole is not a body doing business that it simply debates and recommends well let us examine this i wish to call the attention of the house just at this point to the following language in the constitution of the united states each house shall be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members anda iajority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendanca of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide it is claimed that a committee of the whole house is not the house in the sense of the constitution and therefore no infraction of the provision which i have j ust read is caused by the proposed change i wish to ask where is the house when the committee of the whole is in session has it adjourned has it taken a recess if it has not it is in session it goes into committee by a resolution declaring that the house resolve itself into a committee of the whole house on the state of the union it can be nothing but the house you have designated it as a committee but it is the house you have your standing committees and your special committees carved out of the house which when the house is not in session may assemble itself or themselves and proceed according to their own methods on any matter which is referred to them and which they desire to take up or which they are directed to examine by the order of the house and they can not sit while the house itself is in session now how is it with the committee of the whole house on the state of the union that committee can not possibly sit until the house and a quorum of the house shall have assembled it is from that body which is organized under the constitution that is formed a committee of the whole house and out of that body alone may a committee of the whole house be born that is the only way you can reach it that committee can not adjourn each member of the house can fully participate in its proceedings when that committee rises and makes its report it makes it to the house and the house may adjourn but the committee can not what then sir is there in this name is this the way you propose to fritter away the constitution of your country is it by sticking to the letter you mean to destroy its very life and spirit do business says the constitution you say that debate on the great subject of taxation the burdens imposed upon the people on the expenditures of millions of dollars for the public service and reporting resolutions and bills thereon to the house which for centuries in the british parliament and from the beginning of our government until now has been considered indispensable before the house could act on these subjects is not doing business and that the suggestion ofamendments on the subject of tariff or on the subject of ex penditures is not doing business and to report that matter to the house to dispose of is not doing business and do you assert that folxxi t5 lowing this situation of a bill as the result of this debate and the perfection of a measure the previous question ordered on the passage of a bill in the house excluding further debate and amendment does not give the character of doing business to the work of the committee of the whole has not fastened its result upon the legislation of the government from the beginning of the government down until now why air speaker certainly no gentleman upon a second thought will pretend to stand by any such conclusion and if you need any further aid in construing the constitution let us look tothe following language of that instrument buta smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide what is it the house can do when it has no quorum it can send for absentees it can adjourn and by the rulesof law and of common sense it excludes the right and power on the part of that body to do any other than those two things yet gentlemen are claiming that they can take up bills involving millions of dollars in relation to taxation of the people and to expenditures and debate them and that is not doing business ay verily sir in the light of this construction of the constitution it does seem to me that there is a reckless defiance a1 persistent purpose on the partof those gentlemen who have declared their purpose that the majority shall rule even at the expense of the constitution of their country then the republican caucus has decreed that from now henceforth 51 members of the house of representatives made up of 330 can take up and discuss the most intricate questions of taxation can take up and discuss the expenditures of this great government in all its comprehensiveness has determined under this rule that less than onesixth of the representatives of the united states this little body this insignificant body is the vast repository provided for discussing questions of taxation for discussing expenditures and recommending its action to the house of representatives then we shall have the previous question upon it and we will have it railroaded through in a manner that will make the englishspeaking people stand aghast at the progress of radical thought in the nineteenth century again sir in this little insignificant committee invested with these powers it is further provided in committees of the whole house business on the calendars may be taken up in regular order or in such order as the committee may determine unless tl~e bill to be considered was determined by the house at the time of going into committee but bills for raising revenue general appropriation bills and bills for the improvement of rivers and harbors shall have precedence hitherto the proceedings in committee of the whole have been regulated by the calendars taken up and arranged to suit no one to accomplish no purpose how will it be after this you will have various projects in committee of the whole you will have propositions in relation to funding the debt of pacific railroads you will have them relating to the expenditures of millions of dollars for educational purposes you will have them involving millions for the pupose of subsidizing steamship lines you will have others perhaps unprecedented in the history of expenditures in this country involving hundreds of millions in the matter of the navy it will be idle sir for me to undertake to call up from the history of the past the various schemes and persons and forces behind those schemes which will find in the committee of the whole house of 100 51 of whom may make a recommendation the very finest facility for accomplishing their purposes hitherto the calendar has prevented combination among those various interests it was not in the power of this scheme or that or the other to go into the committee and by a union of forces for the purpose of throwing aside that calendar get at the great schemes they have struggled to accomplish in past years and have been defeated in the doing of it hitherto only by the rules of this house they will find sir the very best facilities in that committee hereafter talk of logrolling if you please on river and harbor bills logrolling in the matter of public buildings but sir when you shall have organized your committee of the whole on this basis these things will dwindle into insignificance and the country will stand aghast at the result they will be able to accomplish more than that sir this committee of one hundred may by a vote of the majority of the members present at any time after fiveminute debate is begun on a proposed amendment to any section or paragraph close all debate upon said section or paragraph the house may have remitted to this committee the great consideration of important measures and yet when you come to that debate out of which the most light is evolvedthe fiveminute debateit is competent in that little body to limit debate to five minutes om either side for the first time in our history do we find a commiktee of the whole limiting debate the country will think when this taxation shall have been accomplished when these expenditures shall have been fastened upon it that that committee will have done a vast amount of ill and sir i fear that it will notstop there heavy burdens may be fixed upon us today which tomorrow can not be removed and it may endure for generations this report contains another matter of considerable moment rule xv provides in the absence of a quorum fifteen members including the speaker if there is one shall be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members and in all calls of the house the doors shall be closed the names of the members shall be cal led by the clerk and the absentees noted and those for whom no sufficient excuse is made may by order of a majority of those present be sent for and arrested wherever they may be found by officers to be appointed by the sergeantatarms for that purpose and their attendance secured and retained and til house shall determine upon what condition they shall be discharged this is an extraordinary remedy in the third congress there was an effort in the senate of the united states to make it as one of the rules of the body that members should be fined for nonattendance they were unable to adopt it legislators under the rules of this house have since that period attempted the same thing by placing it in the code of rules and it has been a failure never executed in the british parliament this same authority hatsell on the subject of enforcing the dttendance of members by fines declares that it has neverbeen executed and for hundreds of years it has never been attempted yet today we have a proposition presented to us that absentees shall be sent for brought to this house and retained here their attendance secured and retained and the house shall determine upon what condition they are to be discharged they are not simply brought into this hall but they are to be put into custody they are to be put into whatever custody the majority of the house shall see fit and they are to continue in that custody until the majority of this house shall determine upon the time and manner of their discharge i say that the genius of our institutions the genius of the anglosaxon civilization which has never permitted it in england for centuries and has made it absolutely a nullity here will revolt at this monstrosity the scene of members brought in and fastened how in the discretion of that body by whatever means it sees fit kept here under the dictation of that majority and required to remain in that sort of condition as legislators to make a quorum to transact business sir you will have facilities for legislation you will have your committee of 100 as a quorum that committee may close debate on any proposition in fiveminute debate it may go to any stretch it pleases it may combine for the purpose of making many and excessive drafts upon the treasury the moneyed lords will be gladdened when the sanctity of the constitution is gone when the longbarred bolts of the treasury are broken and when they may imprison the representatives of the people if needed to consummate their wicked schemes i know it is to be attempted i know it has been decreed that this scene shall be made possible on the floor of the house of representatives of the united states it does not betoken the oldtime jealousy of freemen it does not betoken the oldtime jealousy of power it does not call up the scenes of conflict between barons and kings it does nol call up the conflicts between them and the people nor the characters therein formed you have dispensed with the diadem its specter has passed away in the progress of civilization the laws of primogeniture have passed away the tyranny of the landholders has gone with it but sir do not be led into the belief that these securities that these constitutional proceedings that thisj ealousy of power which has characterized our race in the past and grown out of those conflicts has come to be obsolete we have another tyranny to confront us we have the tyranny of the majority which sometimes under the direction of corrupt influences sometimes under hasty legislation sometimes from one cause or another needs extreme measures of resistance and for the people and for the minority of this house i am not willing silently to see these scenes enacted here without making a protest even when i know it is to be unavailing in addition to this matter of facilitating business we have another provision in relation to delay there was a practice under the old rule when bills wereintroduced on monday for reference to send up bills containing many pages and have them read with the view of preventing the house from reaching the next business in order to wit the suspension of the rules in this way the gentleman from kansas has prevented time and time again the consideration of a bill funding the debt of the pacific railroads so i have seen the consideration of important measures under the suspension of the rules and with only thirty minutes debate prevented by this device sir i appeal to any american citizen of intelligence of virtue and of honesty whether or not the passage of such measures hastily and without due consideration ought not to have been prevented even by such means again sir there was a habit of making a motion to adjourn a motion to adjourn to a particular day and a motion to take a recess these motions succeeding each other in order and having a rollcall upon each thereby causing delay and preventing the consideration of measures i admit sir that those practices produced some delay they produced some inconvenience but i will undertake to say that the history of the use of that power shows a record of obstruction to legislation which can be justified in good conscience not that i mean to reflect upon the character of the persons who may have been seeking the consideration of certain measures but because the reasons lying at the bottom of the opposition were deep enough to justify such obstruction these were the obstructive methods resorted to in the house so far as i know since i have been a member of it these were the delays that our friends upon the other side have declaimed against and have declared must come to an end you have accomplished that gentlemen by an express provision of these new rules but you have not been content to pause there you have provided that the speaker shall entertain nodilatory motion you have not defined adilatory motion you have declared your inability to define it i took up the other day a volume containing a record of appeals from the decisions of the speakers of this house on questions of order beginning with the first congress and coming on down through more than fifty years once that book was a great authority it was a book well worthy of being printed and stored away in your libraries for the purpose of guiding future legislators in parliamentary proceedings but your rules propose to abolish all that and henceforth that book will be simply a matter to be examined by those who are curious in literary antiquities you propose to leave it with the speaker to determine what are dilatory motions you have been so eager to railroad legislation and to exclude every possibility of obstructing you in your headlong course that you have parted with the power of appealing from his decision and have left him to declare what is dilatory and what is not without any right of appeal"],

discussion it seems that leisy co of peoria in my state shipped certain quantities of beer in quarter barrels eighth barrels and cases to keokuk iowa and there offered them for sale in the original packages they were then seized by the constable or officer of the municipality under the state laws regulating or rather prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors n the state of iowa and replevied by leisy co the case was tried before the lower courtone of the state courts of iowaand a decision was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs leisy co the case was then taken to the supreme court of iowa and that judgment reversed leisy co then brought the case to the supreme court of the united states and that court held as we all know that the plaintiffs leisy co bad the right under the law and under the constitution as they stand at the present time to take this beer in the original packages into the state of iowa and there offer it fbr sale and that up to that point up to the time of its transfer by leisy co to some bona fide purchaser it was not subject to the state laws regulating the sale or confiscation of intoxicating liquors in that state a good deal of criticism has been indulged in here upon the supreme court of the united states i have read this decision word for word carefully and in my view there is a great misapprehension in the minds of many members as to the grounds of that decision the di"], [0.03618746995925903, 0.963812530040741, 1, "i am obliged to the gentleman for his courtesy the objection i have to this proposition is that it destroys the power of the state courts in relation to the enforcement of laws which the state makes the doctrine that because this is pension money and because congress has power to make laws regulating the payment of pensions therefore congress has a continuous power over it is of no force whatever because the moment the pension money is awarded and taken by the party to whom it is awarded it becomes the property of a citizen of the state and in the case of a minor it goes under the control of the state officer appointed for that purpose by whatever names such officers may be known in the several states this

has power as to pension money but this is an entirely different aspect of the matter from that which regards the corpus of the appropriation the4ase is changed the money has gone into the hands of

"obtained unanimous consent to have printed in the record the following memorial resolutions passed unanimously at the fourth national convention of the american shipping and industrial league washington d c february 5 6 and 7 1890 the american shipping and industrial league zealously pursuing its object the promotion of the development of american labor and distribution of the products thereof by the enlargement and extension of the merchant marine of the united states at its session in washington city february 5 6 and 7 1890 reaffirms the declaration made at it last annual meeting whereas our best foreign markets naturally are those of central and south america the west indies eastern asia and australia but from which we are now practically excluded by inadequate transportation facilities of our own and whereas the distribution of american products could be better effected through the instrumentality of american merchants and their own ships which would earn the freight that always has to be paid in cash whether there be profit or loss on the cargo and whereas the nationality of a ship in lvhich goods are transported generally carries with it to a great extent the command of the market to which the goods are consigned and also controls the exchanges by which payments are effected and whereas the decay of american shipping has had and must naturally have an injurious effect upon all industries because it forces the country to pay enormous sums in cash for foreign transportation which sums might and should be returned to our country through our own merchants owning their own shipping and whereas a merchant marine is absolutely essential to the maritime defense of the nation since without it we will not have seamen to man the navy in time of war and whereas the rapidly developing industrial power of the south makes it certain that with the aid of that section the time is at hand when the united states will he able with proper protection of the shipping interests to defy the open and fair competition of the world in the foreign export trade therefore lieit resolved that this convention urge upon the congress of the united states proper measures for the revivaland extension of the merchant marine and declare that among such measures we recognize as timely and effective the bill known as the tonnage bill which provides that every vessel sail or steam built and owned in the united states and engaged in the foreign trade plying between the ports of the united states and foreign ports or between foreign ports and other foreign ports shall be allowed the sum of 30 cents per gross registered ton for each 1 000 miles sailed outward and inward and pro rata for any distance traveled less than 1 000 on any voyage or voyages the payments at the rate of 30centsper ton for each 1 000miles traveled as herein provided shalleon tinue for the term of ten years at that rate and thereafter for another term of nine years at a reduction of 3 cents per ton each year upon each 1 000 miles traveled and pro rata for any less distance and in recommending this bill for immediate passage we do it upon the ground that it will place the merchant marine engaged in the foreign trade upon an equality with that of other nations resolved that this convention further urge upon congress the immediate provision for the defense of the coast and seaport cities of the united states on the lakes as well as the seaboard resolved that we hail with gratification the acts of congress providing for the rebuilding and equipment of a strong and efficient navy

dcgenerateinto privateobloquyand personal reflections then it is the duty first of the speaker and if he neglects that duty then of the house to interpose immediately and not to permit expressions to go unnoticed or uncensured which may give a ground of complaint to the ther house of parliament and thereby introduce proceedings and mutual accusations between the two houses which can never be terminated without difficulty and disorder 1709 if an offense of this kind should be committed of so aggravated a character as to deserve censure or punishment it can only be taken cognizance of by the louse in which it is committed and the nature and mode of redressor punishment if punishment is necessary must be determined upon and inflicted by it ecich house having exclusive jurisdiction over the persons of its inembers for all parliamentary offenses committed within its walls that house may of course either take up the matter spontaneously or upon the complaint of the other or of the

them the subjectof comment at the time w hetherby way of answer explanation commendation discussiou or animadversion and whenever any such allusion is made in any form in which it can be brought
