would rather that they speak for themselves the st lawrence seaway and power project is an extravagant political fraud being wished on the american people by president roosevelt under the guise of national defense for defense of whom and what can it be that we propose to landlock our great navy the most powerful in the world and await an attack by the aggressor navies in lake michigan the absurdity of the defense subterfuge is clearly demonstrated by the fact that it will take at least 4 years to complete this project if we must spend half a billion dollars for canals for defense purposes why not dig a sealevel canal in nicaragua or at panama that at least would make sense and would be for national defense i am opposed to the st lawrenceocean ship canal project as being detrimental to our own import and export trade and adversely affecting the ports of buffalo albany new york city and a half dozen american cities on the eastern seaboard it would mean transferring by the use of congressional appropriations of our american products and trade to montreal canada and hence by foreign ships to european nations this would result in destroying our own commercial interests the american merchant marine and creating unemployment in boston new york philadelphia baltimore and norfolk and even further south in the gulf of mexica it would also mean the crippling of the new york state barge canal and diverting traffic from our railroads employing scores of thousands of loyal american citizens the proposal is harmful to the interests of 30 000 000 consumers on the eastern seaboard adding insult to injury as they pay approximately onehalf of the federal taxes in addition the st lawrence ship canal would be frozen solid for 4 months a year and the st lawrence river is fogbound for part of the summer the st lawrence ship canal project was conceived in political propaganda aimed to obtain votes on election day in certain farm states this political myth has been exposed repeatedly as being of no advantage to the american farmers in competition with the canadian surplus farm exports and particularly wheat it will not help a single american farmer to sell a single bushel of wheat to england because of her preferential treatment of the products of her dominions the united states is on the road to bankruptcy and every project not essential to our

deal political bureaucracy was plunging this nation into debt at a frightful rate and that some time pay day would come around our warning fell on deaf ears and the administration continued to persuade the people that the new dealers had discovered economic magic under which the government could give the people something for nothing the new deal administration had made no such discovery quite to the contrary the administration had gone back to the old and wellknown device of borrowing the funds which it was spending and wasting instead of doing the politically unpopular thing of asking the people to dig up in the form of taxes the vast sums to pay for all the boondoggling and experimentation in which the new deal administration indulged for 8 years under these conditions the people were not asked to make any real sacrifices and the new deal rolled merrily on its way but pay day has now arrived the american people are going to be dreadfully shocked in the pocketbook nerve by the taxes ivhich the new deal administration is now going to impose upon them and the new tax bill now being considered by the house ways and means committee is only the beginning this first shock of the impact of increased taxes against the purses of the people is only the first of a succession of shocks which this administration will have to administer as a direct result of its spendthrift policies of the past 8 years no longer do administration officials sneer when members of congress point out that we must now begin to pay the fiddler for the wild political dervish dance through which the nation has been whirled by the new deal for 8 years instead administration officials having found in our international relationships and our utter lack of an adequate national defense reasons which they hope will justify them in the minds of the people are now somber and with grave misgivings searching hither and yon for new sources of revenue while they wonder how on earth the people can stand the pressure of the excessive taxation which the new dealers privately admit has become an inescapable necessity it is regrettable that the administration and the nation paid so little heed to the warnings of the republican defensestudy committee which in february 1939 warned thatwhen we entered that war in april 1917 the national debt stood at 1 100 000 000 in the 18 months of our participation we spent something in excess of 35 000 000 000 to meet that expenditure we raised about ten billions through taxes we borrowed the remainder and came out of the world war with a national debt of twentysix billions compare that to our present situation for 8 or 9 years the federal treasury has been running in the red through all these years we have been spending much more than we have collected from taxes the more we have spent the more we have borrowed as a result we have piled up a huge national debt let us remember therefore that should we be drawn into a war of first magnitude we should have to start with a debt of at least fortyfour billionsprobably moreand then finance the efforts on top of that debt it is a prospect which must concern every thoughtful person in the land no one at this time can foresee accurately the measures we might have to employ were we drawn into war but all of us can visualize the danger to our institutions were we forced to resort to inflation to confiscation and ultimate repudiation could our free institutions survive such a strain similar institutions have perished in other lands within our time driven to such expedients it might well be that we shall have failed actually in our defense our plea is that the congress and others in high authority reestablish thrift as a virtue in the conduct of government as it is a virtue in the conduct of the individual this earnest plea by the republican defensestudy committee was met with scorn ridicule and indifference by the administration it goes without saying that we must have an absolutely invincible national defense the unneutral acts of the administration for the past 4 years have made this necessary we must consider the disastrous economic consequences which will inevitably follow the war and we must prepare our defense against the repercussions of that coming economic disaster too dangerously long the new deal administration has deferred the politically unpleasant and unpopular task of telling the people frankly that they must pay and pay dearly for all of these experiments trials of theory and financial favors which the new deal bureaucrats have passed out with such a lavish hand pay day has arrived taxes are to be doubled tripled and quadrupledand the end is by no means in sight it is a pity but a necessity that the billions so gaily

is that this rule will be adopted practically unanimously and that the bill which the rule makes in order will also be passed those who have preceded me have stressed the fact that the coal industry is a great industry there is no question but that coal is still king in our country it is one of the greatest individual industries of the nation the fact that in 1929 the coal industry reached its peak of production and in that same year the industry lost nearly 12 000 000 goes to prove the statement heretofore made today that this is one industry that needs stabilization we are not passing a new bill today we are simply considering whether or not we will extent for 2 years an act that is already written on the statute books and as the gentleman from tennessee stated an extension of 2 years is n6t too much while an extension of less than 2 years would not accomplish the purposes intended the present price schedules have only been in operation a few months and have not had a fair trial yet man must have certain commodities to live he must have enough food he must have enough shelter he must have enough heat to have heat he must have coal or something that takes the place of coal whenever we talk with reference to energy and with reference to heat we think of coal as being about 70 percent of the energy of this nation when you talk of substituting electricity for coal you must remember that probably more than half of electricity consumed is generated by coal coal is the great poor mans fuel basically so far as the products produced in the nation are concerned coal comes next to food products in necessity coal is only produced in a comparatively few locations consequently transportation is one of the greatest factors in the price of coal it has been said that this legislation is pricefixing legislation and many members opposed it in 1935 and 1937 because they thought it involved the proposition of price fixing i have here a chart which i shall refer to a little later the impression has been abroad for many years that the production of coal is a sort of racket that the operators and miners are more or less to blame for that impression but i am glad to bring the information that there is no industry in the nation comparable in size where the man who employs labor an i the man who labors agree so amicably both the producer of coal and the miners agree that this legislation should be continued and that the bill should pass today all over the nation we are confronted with strikes there was a time many years ago when people would point their finger at the miners union as being an organization that fostered a good many strikes but there has not been a serious strike between the miners and operators of coal for many years further there is no group of men organized in what we call unions that has done so much for the uplift of the laboring man the workingman as this organization we call the miners union they have carried the burden of the fight for a higher standard of living without being able to bring as much improvement in this respect to themselves as they have brought to other workers the figures show that the average wages of miners is less than 1 000 per year someone has said that he does not believe this law is constitutional let me remove any fear you may have with regard to the constitutionality of this bill the supreme court has already spoken on the constitutionality of the act if those of you who are lawyers will read the sunshine case decided by the supreme court a few months ago you will find there one of the most complete cases that i believe i have ever read as handed down by the supreme court in that case the supreme court deals with every provision in the act and finds it constitutional from every angle let me discuss with you for a momhent how this bill operates it is not an easy matter to discuss all this in the short time at my disposal but let me present to you the best i can how this law is handled how it operates in the first place the law sets up what we call the bituminous coal commission we had such a commission consisting of seven men until about a year and a half ago these seven men proved one fact that seven man cannot officiate very intelligently and properly in the handling of governmental business there were too many of them that was the trouble with this commission individually most of them were splendid gentlemen but collectively when harrassed by a few highranking politicians each wanting to put on the pay roll a great long list of his own friends the thing was so very topheavy that it would not function everybody who knew about this felt it was a disgrace it got so bad that the president of the united states reached out one day and got the commission by the nape of the neck as it were and drew it in to the white house and discharged the whole commission and turned the work over to the secretary of the interior and it has been functioning pretty well down there ever since of course if you need to know the cost of producing coal you are going to have to leave it to somebody that knows the coal business you cannot leave that to a drygoods merchant you cannot leave it to a man who produces wheat any more than you can leave the matter of determining the price of producing wheat to the coal people consequently the miners and the mine owners and the consumers of the nation were all considered in the proposition of determining how this law should be operated when this bill was prepared all due consideration was given to the proposition of taking care of the consumer there are two people in nearly every public transaction who must be taken care of one is the little producer who comes in competition with the big producer and the other is the consumer they are the two people that must be taken care of in the very nature of things they cannot take care of themselves as to this bill the little producer of coal may have a right to complain it is hard sometimes to do much for him i have done the best i can for him and the committee on ways and means has done the very best it can and i hope the commission has done the best it can if it has not done the best it can for the little producer it will do better in the future this act cannot be justified in the future if it results in serious disadvantage to the great group of small producers or if it increases the price of coal unduly"], [0.9210049510002136, 0.9210049510002136, 0, "i sincerely hope that this amendment is adopted in my deliberate judgment in the light of my
