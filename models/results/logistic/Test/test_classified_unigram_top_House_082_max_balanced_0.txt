were vested in him by international agencies of which the united states is but one participant in the week that has elapsed truman has failed to provide a clean and clear bill of particulars in support of his action if the charge is one of military insubordination then the preliminary steps toward a court martial should have been taken within a matter of hours after macarthur was relieved of his command if the general was removed because of differences in diplomatic policy then truman should make plain when and where such authority was delegated to him by the united nations security council and the far eastern commission congress and the american people are entitled to know now and not another year or two hence whether this is another truman usurpation of power it was with amazement and deep regret that i read the text of a speech made yesterday in chicago by gen omar bradley to the national association of radio and television broadcasters in that speech general bradley went far beyond the realm of the military and into the field of socalled american foreign policy it is understood that the bradley speech was cleared by the state department and dean acheson whose back has not yet been turned on alger hiss presumably the military can discuss and support socalled foreign policy on any platform as long as it is the brand endorsed by acheson and truman here we have the spectacle of one fivestar general bradley being permitted even aided and abetted by the state department to voice foreign policy whereas another fivestar general macarthur is castigated and crucified for allegedly entering the same field i still another fivestar general eisenhower was turned loose under the atlantic pact label to propagandize the trumanacheson european policies therefore i reiterate it appears that it is perfectly all right for the generals to indulge in policies and politics unlimitedas long as they stay on the trumanacheson side of the fence in other words the high brass can now speak on any and every subject the only requirement being that they clear it with dean i might add that it seems to me general bradley as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff ought to have enough work these days to keep him completely occupied at the pentagon"], [0.014109969139099121, 0.9858900308609009, 1, "i move that the house do now adjourn the motion was agreed to accordingly

president truman has removed general macarthur as the united nations commander in the par east has shocked and stunned many of us here in washington just as it has the american people throughou the nation the president announced his dismissal of macarthur at 1 a m washington time on wednesday morning when most of the people in the capital city were asleep the announcement apparently came a this time in order that administration forces in the congress could have time to prepare to meet the storm of protest from other congressmen who are now speaking out against this tragic action the president has declared that macarthur was relieved of his fareastern commands because he was unable to give his full support to the policies of the united nations but the real reason macarthur has been fired has been because of the conflict between macarthur on the one hand and mr truman and dean acheson on the other in regard to united states policy toward communist china and the war in korea americas great fighting general under whom i served as an enlisted man in the south pacific during world war ii has demanded the right to bomb concentrations of chinese troops and supplies in manchuria to slow down and cut off chinese communist forces now killing our boys in korea truman and acheson refused this request macarthur has asked for the authority to use in korea some of the more than 600 000 nationalist troops now on formosa and has even suggested a nationalist attack against the chinese mainland to ease the pressure on the american forces now fighting against a numerically superior enemy in korea truman and acheson have refused macarthur has called the korean conflict a fullscale war where we have suffered nearly 60 000 casualties truman and acheson have called it a police action macarthur has demanded that the british and other united nations countries stop sending supplies to communist china through hong kong and cther ports and has called for a full blockade of the china coast truman and acheson have sided with the british who continue to send war supplies to the communists to be used in the killing of americans in korea in the years before the korean war began macarthur constantly spoke out warning this nation against appeasement of communism and urged that a positive foreign policy be carried out to check aggression in the pacific and other parts of the world truman and acheson abandoned china to the communists and said the reds were our friends and just agrarian reformers they appeased and appeased and appeased they were helped in this task by alger hiss and other procommunists they had appointed to serve in the state department thus the controversy between the truman administration and macarthur raged mr truman charged that macarthur has refused to take orders from the president as commander in chief but many others charged that it was mr truman who was refusing to take orders from the american people who demanded that our government cease its policy of appeasement in the far east this week the president made a decision the issue was clear should he accept macarthurs suggestions and recognize the realities of the war in korea or should he dismiss macarthur and once again bow to the demands of dean acheson who has made so many mistakes in the past mr truman took the second course he fired macarthur the hero of bataan and bowed to acheson the man who said he would not turn his back on alger hiss and who called the chinese communists mere agrarian reformers 1 this was a tragic decision the majority of the american people would be far happier and would have far more confidence in our leadership if acheson had been fixed not macarthur for many months now the people have demanded the removal of dean acheson but when the showdown finally came acheson emerged triumphant and americas valiant soldier general macarthur became the martyr of the kansas city political machine which has seized control of the executive branch of our government there was another great american general who was a martyr and he like macarthur tried to speak out in an effort to strengthen the military forces of this nation you will remember him general billy mitchell who dared to urge the brass hats and the nations leaders to develop a powerful air force macarthur now joins gen billy mitchell as a martyr and as a hero since the announcement of general macarthurs removal public opinion has begun to mount in opposition my office has already been flooded with telegrams protesting this arbitrary action by repudiating the wise and inspirational leadership of general macarthur mr truman has done more than any communist bomb could do to disunite and weaken our american people at this hour of national emergency as this confusion sweeps across the nation i should like to suggest the following affirmative steps to be taken by our government first the congress should bring general macarthur back to this country and to washington so that he might speak out without fear of further reprisals by the white house and advise the american people of the true facts of the war in korea and make recommendations for the development of a positive and affirmative policy for the far east and when macarthur returns to this country he should be given a heros welcome unparalleled in our history second after general macarthur has given us the benefit of his wise counsel and if he so recommends we should authorize our new commander in the far east general ridgway to bomb the concentrations of communist troops and supplies in manchuria if general macarthur so recommends we should authorize general ridgway to send to korea some of the hundreds of thousands of chinese nationalist soldiers now on formosa as part of our new policy we should demand that the british and other united nations members stop sending vital supplies and materials to the chinese communists we should demand that the united nations impose enforceable sanctions against any shipment of supplies to soviet russia and her satellite countries as part of this new policy we should begin at once a blockade of the china coast third we must proceed with full vigor and speed to develop our national defense program we must demand that the president take immediate action to rid our government of the corruption and political favoritism which has hampered our defense effort and seriously jeopardized the lives of our fighting men in korea we must demand that the president select able statesmen and not mere politicians to guide the destinies of our nation at this hour of national emergency finally in order to restore some of the confidence in the administration which is so lacking at this hour the congress and the american people should demiand that dean

india regardless of the efforts made to sugarcoat it or disguise it i am convinced that if we pass this bill it will wind up in the end as a gift of 190 000 000 to the government of india it would be a radical departure from longestablished custom for us to collect a debt from another government and i for one have no hope that india will ever repay the money if this bill passes not only do the glotal thinkers in our government expect to give this 190 000 000 to india but they are planning to give her billions of dollars of american taxpayers money if india can get established through this bill as a member of the eca group the amount involved in this bill is just the entering wedge of a larger spending program and what i fear will be an everexpanding program of spending american taxpayers money for the development of india in his testimony on this legislation the secretary of state told the committee on foreign affairs when those of us in the executive branch of the government considered the indian suggestions that the 2 000 000 tons of food grain might be made available on a longterm credit basis we discovered that the problems created were much the same as those involved in the use of indias sterling balances india hopes to finance part of its 6year development program by loans its debtservicing capacity is limited if its credit were pledged for grain it would be unable to qualify for the hopedfor developmental loans in addition credits for the acquisition of consumer goods such as foodstuffs required to meet an emergency situation are economically unz=ound as they provide no basis for the creation of income and foreign exchange to repay the credit it is clear to me that our own interest and indias interest require that we provide the grain which india needs to supplement its purchase program on a grant basis indias plight has been greatly exaggerated by some of the advocates of this proposal although it has been claimed by some that india is threatened by a famine and with mass starvation if we do not pass this bill that claim will not stand investigation the truth is that while india is short 2 030 c03 tons of food grain india is not threatened with a famine nor are her people facing starvation because of that shortage even mr willard thorpe assistant secretary of state for economic affairs who testified in favor of giving this grain to india very frankly told the committ in substance that a failure to send the grain would mean malnutrition for a large number of people but not starvation his testimony is set out on page 60 of the committee hearings here are the facts regarding indias food grain shortage indias total food grain requirement for the year is 50 670 000 tons in spite of all the talk about locusts earthquakes droughts and floods the fact is that she produced 43 770 000 tons she had 700 000 tons available in her pipeline supplies making a total of 44 470 000 tons she had a shortage then of only 6 200 000 tons which left her not a faminestricken nation faced with mass starvation it left her with an original shortage of a little more than one iinth of her normal years supplycommittee report page 6 she is not short now even oneninth of her normal supply she has supplied herself with the greater part of that shortage the shortage which now exists is one twentyfifth of her need for the year one twentyfifth or a 2 weeks supply now a food shortage which amounts to only a 2 weeks supply out of a 12 months period is not a famine you cannot enlarge that into a famine even by the wildest kind of exaggeration you cannot make a famine out of that kind of shortage no matter how hard you are looking for a famine if they were not able to get another bushel of grain and if the worst came to worst the other 50 weeks normal supply of food grains could be spread out a little thinner and without any serious difficulty whatever this would enable them to sustain the people and prevent starvation when a procommunist country such as india is is short only a 2 weeks supply of grain out of a 12 months normal supply we are not justified in calling this relatively minor shortage a famine

600 000 000 budget there is another thing which should be considered in passing on these issues india has a lot of other food in addition to these food grains in question while their food grains provide them with 900 calories a day they have other foods which bring the individual diet up to 1 700 or 1 800 calories per day available food in india is not by any means limited to these food

across from the spot where the town of sistersville w va now stands it is no wonder that washington was impressed with the beauty of the ohio for the 20 miles in the area of sistersville are among the most beautiful in the united states the indians wanted the country back and fought for it until 1802 when they lost the battle for the fort in wheeling a number of indian relics have been found in the vicinity sistersville was settled in 1810 by charles wells a farmer from baltimore county md who raised 22 children there in 1815 charles wells died and sistersville was laid out in lots by sarah wells mccoy and dililah wells grier his seventeenth and eighteenth children it derived its name from the joint ownership of the two sisters the only town by that name in the united states shortly before the civil war a 51man company of soldiers called the sistersville blues was organized most of whom according to the records of the times were six feet tall or over the ladies of the town made their flag and everyone was very proud of the company the war however broke it up with 21 of the men serving on the southern side and the rest serving with the union army for many years there was bitter feeling among the old comrades the vicinity was in northern territory but many of the residents were southern sympathizers a number of them fled south to serve in the dixie armies one of these charles p russell a prominent lawyer was associated with jefferson davis as his counselor when mr davis was tried for treason sistersville was also the home of the honorable abraham dickenson soper chairman of the wheeling convention which organized west virginia as a state during this time the only transportation to sistersville was supplied by river steamboats in 1884 the b 0 railroad was built bringing trains to the town the thing that brought about the real expansion of sistersville however was the discovery of oil in 1891 with the drilling of the famous pole cat well first producing oil well in the region discovery of the well opened up the sistersville pool one of the countrys richest fields famous as the only field ever found in which water was on top of the oil the pole cat pumped water more than a year and a half before it began producing oil commercially with the opening of the pole cat a real westerntype boom descended on sistersville it suddenly sprang from a rural village of about 300 to a boom mining town of 15 000 houses were torn down to make room for drilling derricks shacks and tents were thrown together to help house the people and houseboats lined the river banks on both sides for a mile along the river the town was wide open saloons and gambling houses flourished theaters sprang up one of the most popular entertainers was ben turpin later to become the famous crosseyed entertainer of the movies at one point there were 50 different oil companies operating in the sistersville field they drilled 2 500 oil wells when the standard oil interest got control and it was learned how to separate the salt water from the oil the field was finally stabilized by 1912 things had settled down the boom was over since that time sistersville has become a staid family community it has a reputation of being one of the cleanest cities in the country and a few years ago had the largest bank deposits per capita of any city its size in the united states one

that this body would not have passed this bill unless the safeguards which are included in the amendments whicl i have offered and which have been accepted"], [0.0006638169288635254,

words i also was very much puzzled because the committee did not see fit to follow the recommendation of the budget for the surveys of the rivers in new york and new england for flood control power and related subjects i am not going to offer an amendment because yesterday amendments were not favorably received and the temper of the house seems to be the same today i think probably the members feel that the money for this just cause will be added when the bill goes to the other body as i have said on the floor numerous times i have felt that we in new england have been discriminated against for a number of years i assure the house that to have new england suffer severely economically is very bad for the country new england pays very heavy taxes new england is entitled to consideratioa instead of neglect today in the merrimack river the engineers are watching closely the flood conditions in new hampshire and massachusetts they do not know whether we will have a flood or not ten days ago they felt that we might have a flood larger than the 1938 flood something permanent in construction must be done to remedy the danger of high waters i say again as i did yesterday that the governor of new hampshire and the governor of the commonwealth of massachusetts are very remiss in not getting together and signing the compact between the two states but if the money for the survey comes in and the appropriation is ready i am sure those compacts will be signed at once there is no doubt about the danger that will ensue to the national defense if we have a flood i hope when the conferees of this subcommittee on appropriations and the senate conferees get together the house conferees will follow the recommendation that i am sure the senate will maketo restore money for the

time an answer to the question i asked in general debate as to whether or not we could not expect sometime in the future in the immediate future a program for additional acreage for cotton and other
