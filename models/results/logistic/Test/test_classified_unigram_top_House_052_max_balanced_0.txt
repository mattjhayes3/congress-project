prepare a bill of this character the fortyninth fiftieth and fiftyfirst congrcsses adopted acertain policy connccted with the coast defenses under which the works at watervilet n y have been nearly completed for the purpose of enabling the government to construct in part the larger guns and so also as to render the government independent of any combination of contractors to make the government pay more than ought to b ie construction of these heavy guns there have also been made at watervliet type guns of a certain character and contracts have been made with private works for the construction of 8 10 and 12inch guns and mortars known as castiron mortars steel hooped it has been the purpose of the committee to complete the construction of the plant at watervliet so that the government may be in possession of a firstclass plant for the construction of these guns the committee has also recommended a sum of money necessary for the completion of the works at watertown mass where the carriages for these guns have to be made it is as important to have a plant for the construction of carriages as a plant for the manuacture of guns in the third place the committee has recommended the appropriation of a sum sufficient to keep at each of these two factories a band of disciplined and skilled laborers who may be the nuclei of larger forces in case of any extraordinary and sudden emergency the committee has recommended an apprbpriation for the purchase of steel and the continued construction of those guns which can not be made in a hurry which take a certain number of years to manufacture so that the manufacture of the guns may be continued dluring the time of peace the committee has reduced the appropriation for all that sort of manufacture which can be produced by private plants in a short time in case of emergency allowing them to continue to be made but in smaller quantities as for instance projectiles and the smaller sorts of gun carriages things which can be produced by the private manufacturers of america in very large quantities and in comparatively short periods the committee has not increased the appropriation for the construction of the emplacements for the batteries nor for the purchase of additional sites the present plan recommended by a board appointed by the late secretary of war and substantially adopted by previous congresses wasa plan which will not enable the coast to be adequately defended according to the recommendations of the board until 1920 it seemed to the committee that the addition of a year or two or the knocking off of a year or two from 1920 was not a matter of very extraordinary importance and that in the present condition of thze treasury our purpose was to continue the construction of the plants so that we would be in possession of firstrate factories thereby protecting ourselves against the gouging of any combination secondly to continue the construction of the larger guns thirdly to continue the purchase by condemnation of the sites already selected to continue the erection of such emplacements as are just now necessary and to diminish the appropriation for those other works that could be completed in haste the entire amount of the bill is something over 2 400 000 with an additional authorization to the secretary of war to make contracts amounting to something over 1 300 000 making the amount of obligation upon the treasury by this bill something over 3 700 000 the committee has not used the appropriations of former congresses as the standard for appropriations in this bill but as evidence only of what were proper appropriations taking as other evidence the testimony of the secretary of war the commanding general of the army the chiefs of the bureaus of ordnance and of engineering and such other evidence as might be before us the idea of the committee as to economy was to give what was a proper appropriation whether it exceeded or was below what had been given by former congresses for the purpose of keeping this particular department of the government in the highest state of efficiency it is impossible for us to now furnish the money necessary for coast defense that can not be done within the next twenty years under the plan adopted as that will require that period of time now one more thought which i want the committee to understand heretofore appropriations for the purchase of sites and the building of emplacements were limited to the harbors upon our eastern and comparatively speaking northern seacoast the farthest south being at fort monroe hampton roads this and the former congress have passed bills to secure deepwater harbors at galveston savannah mobile charleston new orleans and baltimore and we will eventually have to make appropriation for works sufficient to defend those harbors but at the present state of water the cost is much smaller than will be necessary and the money appropriated for that purpose ought at least to have efficient results in other words the defense which is necessary for the soithern waters in the present condition will be entirely inadequate to defend them in the new condition which will result as it is hoped under this new appropriation we have therefore thought it wise to remove from the war department the limitation that was put upon it so that it might take steps at once to buy sites and take what are necessary preliminary steps for the defense of those harbors in other words we turn over to the president of the united states and the secretary of war the discretion as to the places where the money ought to be spent for the acquisition of sites and for the building of those emplacements unless some gentleman desires to ask me a question i will reserve whatever of my time

declaration in this same report on page 21 the declaration manufacturing establishments in one of the cities in my district which i have just read was intended for the manufacturer but he talked very largely about wool he asserted positively and this declaration is intended for the farmer proved it that if wool should be placed on the free list it would this fact shows that the american woolgrowers do not receive any indecline 10 cents a pound and this decline would reduce the price crease whatever in the prices of their wool by reason of the tariff on foreign of woolen cloth at least 40 cents a pound that it would make wool the manufacturer more prosperous and give the laborer larger now one or the other of these statements is wages untrue which is it will the placing of wool upon the free unfortunately the same gentleman was billed the next night list make it higher or leave it as it is or will it reduce the price at an agricultural town in my district and the most important which position do you propose to take gentlemen for i would farm product of the town was wool he was informed of this like to see you choose one of these alternatives now let us fact and coached before he opened his speech he proceeded to know what is to be your argument but i know what it is to be announce that he was a friend of the farmera great friend of it is to be one thing in one place and another thing in another the farmer in fact that he was a farmer himself that he kept place sheep too and that he wanted to tell his audience of farmers wool prices here and abroad as a farmer just what free wool would do now what is the fact the gentleman from tennessee said that a table which has been incorporated in the the majority report he said gentlemen put wool on the report of the majority of the committee showed that a certain free list and the demand for wool will be increased so much that kind of wool fort philip australian which is of the same grade the price will be even higher than under protection and so on as ohio medium is within 2 cents of the same price in london he made a very taking speech until at the close a gentleman as in boston i knew that there was some mistake either in the in the audience who had heard him the night before at the man table or the inference drawn from it i looked at this table and ufacturing city in my district exposed the trick i saw that it was made up on the authority of messrs mauger it is needless to say that that orator was not billed for another avery wool dealers of boston i wrote to mauger avery for appointment

remarks messrs mauger avery who as the sheepless shepherd are quoted as authority for this statement in this table write now gentlemen on the other side if you propose to go into that fort philip australian wool although of the same grade the next campaign and tell your farmer constituents that the is spoutwashed and skirted and shrinks only 20 to 25 per cent putting of wool upon the free list will not lower the price of wool but that ohio medium is washed on the sheeps back and shrinks i advise you to be careful and send some other speaker to manu 40 per cent facturing towns where it is necessary to proclaim that free wool and the gentleman from michigan has already means cheaper wool and cheaper clothing and to take particular read a letter from s n d north esq of boston who furnished care that no listener at one meeting shall be present at another the tables by request confirming this statement and adding that meeting for purposes of comparing prices allowance must be made for the sir you can not make that doubleheaded plan work the different skrinkage placing of wool upon the free list will do one of three things it thus it seems that while the two kinds of wool compared by will either reduce the price paid to the american farmer for his the majority of the ways and means committee are of the same wool or it will leave the price the same as it is now or it will in grade yet the shrinkage i e the percentage of clean wool after crease it now which horn of the dilemma are you proposing scouring is 20 per cent more in one pound of fort philip austo take i notice that the majority of the democratic members tralian skirted wool than in one pound of unskirted ohio medium of the committee on ways and means have decided to take pas making due allowance for both skirting and spoutwashing and sage in both boats in order to be safe the real difference in price as appears by a communication from let me read from that xeport two contradictory statements i messrs justice bateman co of philadelphia which i will presume that the report is so constructed as to have passages print in connection with my remarks is about 11 cents per pound i find from this table that the actual difference in price of clothing wool of similar grade condition and shrinkage here and in london is never less than 8 cents per pound and from that up to 11 cents and that the difference in real cost provided they were upon the same basis is substantially 11 cents per pound on some wools the difference is only 8 cents on some 9 i am speaking now of clothing wools not of carpet on some 10 and on others 11 cents and even more there is no doubt that the american farmer in consequence of the protective duty gets today for his wool from 8 to 11 cents per pound more than he would get if wool should be put on the free list as you propose by this bill in other words the farmer who keeps only 100 sheep yielding 6 pounds of wool per head would lose 60 per annum by the operation of your bill the farmer who keeps 300 sheep would lose 180 but says some one he can get his clothing enough cheaper with free wool to more than offset any increase price for wool by protection he will get it cheaper only so far as the difference is taken out of the farmer for the small reduction of the ad valorem duty on cloth will not affect the price of woolens used by the masses even the abolition of the wool duty will not reduce the price of cheap goods into which substitutes for wool largely enter if the average consumption of an average farmers family is 30 pounds of wool per annum as estimated and the average clip of the sheep per head is 6 pounds the farmer who keeps only five sheep is compensated for all the additional cost of his clothing growing out of the

ample room for enlarging it and thereby increasing the capacity our experience is that the first days working in our experimental plant clearly satisfied us that we had been laboring under a wrong impression for many years that tin plate could be made here as well as in any other part of the world that there was nothing mysterious about it that the process was most simple tin plate is simply the output of a rolling mill namely sheet steel or sheet iron coated with pure tin or a mixture of tin and lead we have received from american mills as fine quality and finish of black sheets as we ever received from any foreign country and within the past few days we received a shipment that appears to be superior to any we ever saw if the rolling mills now being erected to supply our new works are inadequate we are satisfied that we can get ample supplies from the rolling mills now running and in course of erection there is no doubt in our minds that there would be more capital invested more mills erected if there was confidence in the duty remaining as it is for a reasonable length of time there is no question that the industry will be successful and become one of the largest and most valuable in this country if the article were popularly known as coated sheet iron or coated sheet steel instead of tin plate who would think of disturbing the present tariff upon it who would think it could not successfully be produced here the value of american tin plate is the value of american sheet steel or sheet iron to which is added the value of the coating and the labor of puttingiton if we should buy our tin plate in foreign countries then we should buy our sheet steel sheet iron etc in the same way but if our prices on the steel metal and labor are right then the total value of the three must be right as for selling prices competition will soon regulate them the difference in cost being simply the difference in labor which will be reduced by american invention and improved machinery repeating the history of steel rails and many other articles somers brothers of brooklyn n y say as you will remember we explained to you when here we were departing very largely from the beaten path of the welsh manufacturers in the direc tion of improved automatic machinery in the various operations of tinplate making this we had to invent devise and reduce to working drawing before we could begin with the active building all this has consumed considerable time but we trust to soon be in position to begin operations and hope on receipt of your next quarterly report to be able to give you statistics of our manufacture we have built and equipped our mill from the foundations upwards in the most substantial manner and spared no expense pains or thought to make it the most complete and perfect of its kind in existence the expenditure has been in the neighborhood of 250 000 and will when in operation turn out about 3 000 boxes of tin plateper week it will be devoted entirely to the manufacture of bright tin plates of the regular market sizes for canning and similar work there are six mills for rolling the hot steel sheets and three pair of cold rolls we are erecting five tinning stacks with an additional one in case of emergency the united states iron and tinplate manufacturing company at demmler pa wtite on march 31 1892 during the last three months our operations in tinning sheets have been on a small scale but we have made considerable quantities of black plate and shipped to other concerns for tinning now at the beginning of a new quarter we have our new tinning house in operation we have five tinning stacks ready for operation and the sixth one nearly completed this will give us a capacity for finishing 200 boxes of tin and tern plates per day besides this we are producing daily from 20 to 25 tons of black plate st a ble for tinning purposes w e building three additional blackplate mills which iill increase our capacity to 40 tons daily we expect these pew mills will be in operation within six wseeks or sixty days the man who will not be persuaded by this testimony of the existence of a tinplate industry in this country including therein the production of black sheets would not be persuaded though one rose from the dead so much then for the position on which the gentleman planted himself yesterday the answer to which is that his premises were false that it is proven by the figures of the treasury department and out of the mouths of these witnesses that the aggregate product of american tin plate manufactured up to this time and put upon the market has been in the main the product of american capital american labor and american inventive genius now what more does the gentleman from indiana say as to the repeal proposed in this bill he says that this is an insignificant industry that there has only been made about three days supply well the democratic party has changed front the gentleman is the first to confess that we make tin plate the old cry was you can not make american tin plate and now when we have made it they say oh yes you can make it but look how little you have made well we have gained that much we have gained the concession that we can make tin plate we have gained i should think enough to enlist american patriotism to arouse american pride and to detach the democratic party from its alliance with british tinplate makers so that they should march shoulder to shoulder with us in the development of a new and already established american enterprise when the gentleman from indiana concedes that we have made american plates when he concedes that we are making american plates i care not to how small an extent he concedes that america has given her capital has given her labor has given her energy has given her pluck to the inauguration of a new manufacture and he can not look back down the one hundred years of our industrial history and show me an instance where america has done this that she has noteventually marched to triumphant success let me substitute for the unamerican sneer of the gentleman from indiana what the london iron trade of january 2 said with respect to this matter the article is headed a british warning to welsh tinplate makers it is seemingly but a few years ago that we made all the rails that america needed it was the welsh rail which linked the puritan north to the cavalier states of the south which crossed the great pampas and wastes bringing the mormon into control and helping to subdue the impetuous redskin and bringing

mineral or of any other character if the act is still in force and has not been forfeited by the company then that company is entitled to every alternate section of land unless the land be mineral in character and wherever a mineral section is found then it is entitled to other lands in lieu of it this question has already gone to the courts for adjudication it has so far as the people i have the honor to represent are concerned assumed an alarming attitude judges caldwell and sawyer two circuit judges of the united states have held that the question involved was whether or not the lands were known to be mineral lands at the time the grant took effect two united states district judges judges thomas and sabin concur and one united states district judge judge knowles of montana dissents if

vest if possible title in the government once more i understand that many members of the committee entertain the view that the northern pacific company has in effect forfeited its entire grant if so it is a consistent position to take and the government ought to commence proceedings at once and have the courts declare that the contract has been forfeited by the company if however we admit that
