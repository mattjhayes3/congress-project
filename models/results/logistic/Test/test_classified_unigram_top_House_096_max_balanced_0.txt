teach us anything about foreign aid it is that you cannot buy friendship the motion that providing the promarxist sandinista regime of nicaragua with 75 million in hopes that such aid will gain us influence with that government is sheer folly yet this is precisely what the carter administration would have us believe indeed the committee report summarizes and accepts this motivation behind the aid proposal it is sheer naivete to think that the nicaraguan sandinistas are susceptible to united statez or free world influence on the contrary unitedstates financial support of the present regime would only serve to bolster the unpopular leftist government and further entrench its authoritarian control we unitedstates citizens should not be required to prop up this oppressive socialist government through our tax dollars such a proposition is neither in the best interest of the united states nor our neighbors in this hemisphere including i should emphasize the people of nicaragua in a sense the president is asking the congress and the american people to buy a pig in a poke he is seeking rapid and i believe premature approval of this grant before a comprehensive analysis can be made of the situation in nicaragua initial indications of that governments commitment to democratic principles however are lot encouraging in my view congress should not consider such an aid request before free and open elections have been helda minimum condition which must be a prerequisite for resumption of unitedstates support instead we are told by the state department to trust the vague assurances of the sandinistas while the carter administration insists we should ignore the overt promarxist statements and actions of the new government president carter has stated that this 75 million aid package for nicaragua will demonstrate that the united states can be relied upon to support democratic aspirations the rebuilding of broken economies and the security of our friends in the nearbby region a closer examination of the situation however reveals that passage of this bill would contribute toward precisely the opposite result the government currently in control in managua is an unelected totalitarian government created out of chaos power in the country lies with a selfappointed directoratenine men from three sandinista guerrilla factions some with histories of violent terrorist activity and recipients of training weapons and sanctuary in cuba this directorate subsequently named the fiveman ruling junta the overwhelming majority of nicaraguans are opposed to communism and the united states should be encouraging these truly democratic factions to unite to bring reason out of chaos in opposing the bloody procommunist regime thus far they have no role in the sandinista government the state department apparently has never considered this course of action but rather dawdled while the communists consolidated their position within nicaragua and then meekly recommended accepting the sandinistas as being the only government available the carter administration now recommends this amount of money with the misplaced hope that we can entice the sandinistas to implement democratic principles and prevent them from going communist the state department and president carter fail to recognize however that the governing body in nicaragua has already gone communist the remaining question confronting the united states is whether we will help finance their oastrocuban form of government from the early and vociferous antiamerican procommunist statements of the new government it should be obvious that there is no way by any amount of money that the united states can win the true friendship or support of this selfappointed government in nicaragua the marxists in control are inherently opposed to the individual freedom and free enterprise economy for which our nation stands the sandinistas will simply use us to further their own ends and discredit the united states as is the objective of communism worldwide this is the course upon which they have already embarked as should be readily apparent from the initial actions and statements of the junta it should be obvious that fidel castro is the primary force behind the nicaraguan revolution he has consistently supplied the terrorists throughout central america with advisers guns money and also put them in contact with international communists from moscow marxists and plo supporters in such diverse places as libya and panama in october 1979 sandinista deputy foreign minister ramirez affirmed thatthe government of nicaragua is on the side of cuba the soviet union and is in favor of the policy of the ayatollah khomeni of iran on november 20 the managua barricada reported ramirez as statingthe date on which the bolshevik revolution occurred is known historically as the date of the decree of peace which maintains peaceful coexistence among socialist nations and responds to the peoples best interests the nature of the sandinista government becomes even more obvious when we examine those with whom they associate soviet boss brezhnev forwarded his hearty congratulations in october to the new prosoviet ally we congratulate the nicaraguan people for their historic victory against the dictatorial somoza regime the message went on to note that the soviets highly respected the nicaraguan people for their important contribution in the history of the struggle for independence and national liberation the sandinistas were quick to reciprocate these felicitations in kind news services notedthe sandinista workers central and the socialist and communist parties commemorated the russian revolution on its 62d anniversary on december 11 acanpanama reported that another promarxist revolutionary yasir arafat had sent his congratulations the same report noted that nicaraguan leaders met with libyan delegates to discuss ways in which that promarxist country could aid in the nicaraguan reconstruction most recently the nicaraguan delegations abstained on the u n resolution condemning the soviet invasion of afghanistan unmistakenly an antiamerican antifree world vote there should be increasingly less doubt about the prosoviet procuba nature of the sandinistas as procommunist actions further reveal their true character yet the state department continues to hope that nicaraguas leftist tendencies can be moderated by unitedstates aid rather those policies will continue now with unitedstates financial support if the house approves this authorization"],

you have had the time to carefully study all 2 300 pages you may be assuming that this 1981 budget is all the good things president carter says it is unfortunately this is not a budget which will set things right in america from an economic or defense standpoint from the cover of the 1981 budget alone you can get a very good idea of where jimmy carters priorities are note the colorsgreen and whitethe official colors of the cartermondale election campaign in 1976 and again in 1980 this color coordination is no coincidence mr carter has just sent us the most partisan political budget i have ever seen during my 21 years in congress it is a document prepared and printed at the taxpayers expense and directed at the presidential primary elections and not at what is best for all the people of this country and doing that which is necessary to preserve the little freedom which remains in the world let me explain jimmy carters 1981 budget caters to every specialinterest group except the taxpayers in other words it gives out with a lot more butter but dangerously little additional guns his defense budget will barely begin to undo the damage he has inflicted on our national security posture during his first 2 years in office i plan to give an analysis of the defense portion of this budget in a few days while talking about the need to restrain spending he lists in table 14 on page 590 of the budget all the new nondefensespending programs he wants passed while omb did not add up the total cost of all these new programs we did in 1981 these new nondefensespending programs would cost 19 8 billion by 1985 their costs will have grown to over 75 billion this is notrestraint it is reckless deficit spending running wild mr carter boasts that the annual budget deficit is much lower than when he took office but neglects to mention that fully 90 percent of that reduction was achieved by raising taxes not cutting spending he forgets to mention that he mr carter promised us a balanced budget by 1981 he tells us that spending in this budget will grow by only 9 2 percent in 1981 but forgets to say that over the 2year period 197981 spending will have grown by at least 24 7 percent he does not talk about how spending for the current calendar year1980 contnues to grow and is now estimated to top 564 billionup 32 billion from his original reouest for 1980 and 16 billion above the level set in the second budget resolution passed only 2 months ago the 1980 deficit was supposed to be under 30 billion but now mr carter tells us it will be at least 40 billion the chairman of the budget committee in the other body stated on nationwide television last week that by the time the 1980 fiscal year comes to an end on september 30 we will be lucky if we have kept the 1980 deficit below 50 billion finally and most important the budget does not mention unless you look at the fine print on table 21 on the 621st page of the budget that in 1981 the tax burden on the american people will set a peacetime record and that by 1982 the tax burden will have surpassed the alltime record reached in 1944 during the height of world war ii in fiscal year 1981 mr carters budget will have the federal government consuming in taxes 21 7 percent of our gross national product while the federal government has never in peacetime taken that big a slice out of our national income the budget will still run a large deficit if you look at table 21 you will find some other very interesting information for example you will see that in president fords last year in office the federal government took 18 5 percent of the gnp in taxes if president carter had maintained the tax burden at 18 5 percent of the gnp as it existed under mr ford the american people would be paying 89 billion less in taxes in 1981 than they will have to pay under carters tax policy in other words if this 89 billion were divided evenly every taxpaying family in america would be paying 1 200 less in taxes in 1981 had president fords tax policies been continued in trying to defend its budget the administration wrings its hands and says that if only inflation and unemployment were not so high then the budget could be balanced i expect we will hear the same song by the presidents apologists in congress over the next year as well but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled by that sort of rhetoric it is too much like a dog chasing its tail we run budget deficits so we have inflation inflation results in increased spending and more budget deficits which in turn contribute to even more inflation and an excuse for even more spending and more deficits and so forth we must stop this merrygoround and get off instead of bemoaning how the economy affects the budget we have got to spend more time talking about how the budget impacts on the economy that is what we mean when we talk about fiscal policy and setting fiscal policy is supposed to be the principal purpose of the presidents budget and the congressional budget process it is supposed to be but it is not the budget has become a captive of the economy and fiscal policy has become a concept honored only in the breech moreover just because the administration no longer seems to fix a positive and deliberate fiscal course does not mean that the budget does not impact on the economy the problem is it does impact and it is nearly always negative our 13 3 percent inflation rate for last year is solid evidence of this fact i know there are those who will try to point to increased energy costs for this ridiculously high rate but the bureau of labor statistics reveals that without the energy related items we would still have had an inflation rate of 11 1 percent last year president carter and the big spenders keep talking about how more and more of the budget is becoming uncontrollable while at the same time urging more spending in the uncontrollable areas look what he wants done in his budget message he wants congress to enact his national health insurance program to begin in 1983 at a firstyear cost of 24 1 billion not only would this be the largest spending total for the first year of a single new program every penny of that 24 1 billion would be uncontrollable he wants to eliminate the cap on food stamp expenditures not just raise the cap eliminate it altogether therefore enlarging an existing entitlement program and making it completely uncontrollable he wants to further expand the coverage of medicaid already one of our largest uncontrollable programs and asks for a 20 percent increase in budget authority for subsidized housinga program which in the not too distant future will be our most expensive uncontrollable spending program apart from social security so on the one hand we have the president admitting that the growth of uncontrollable federal spending is the principal reason we cannot balance the budget and reduce inflation yet in the next breath he proposes the creation of even more new entitlement programs and the expansion of existing ones if we continue to follow the course mr carter has outlined in a few years we will be in a position where so much of the budget has become uncontrollable that we can leave budgetmaking to a computer and do away with omb cbo the congressional budget committees and the appropriations committees and probably a good number of other committees as well since most of the budget will be committed well before the fiscal year starts the only reason for the congress to meet will be to vote for more new entitlement programs and the increases in the national debt and more taxes required to finance them the root of the problem is spelled out clearly in mr carters budget but he refuses to do anything about it other than the wrong things what jimmy carter still has not realized after 3 long years in office is that it is the private sector not the government which creates wealth and allows our citizens to improve their standard of living it is not the government that creates jobs it is the private sector let me cite an example out of his own 1981 budget to prove that jimmy carter has not become aware of this fact in his budget message the president states that we must enhance our economys productivity i could not agree more but he then rules out any tax relief for american business for american savers and investors necessary to increase that productivity and instead announces he wants a new 2 billion governmentspending program for unemployed youth now i too would like to help unemployed youngsters get jobs but the way to do it is to increase investment in new plants which will use uptodate technology and equipment thereby increasing productivity and making us more competitive in todays world let me repeat i too favor helping young people find jobs but until and unless we get new investment into american industry permanent jobs are not going to be there to find instead of reducing the tax burden to free up funds for such capital investment mr carter has chosen to raise taxes and spend 2 billionall of which will have to be borrowed from investors who might otherwise have invested in the private sector this is what i mean when i say that this administration does not understand basic economics and by its actions only compound our problem when campaigning for office jimmy carter criticized president ford and his advisers for pursuing an economic policy which could lead to high inflation and higher unemployment in fact mr carter used to add the inflation and unemployment rates and called the results the misery index when mr ford left office inflation was at 4 8 percent and dropping unemployment at 7 8 percent and dropping fords socalled misery index was 12 2 percent and declining but look at where mr carter projects his economic policies will bring us by the end of his 4 years in office unemployment of 7 5 percentbarely below the figure at the end of mr fords administration and inflation at 9 5 percent or more than twice as high at it was when ford left office that gives the carter administration a misery index of 17 percentmore than onethird higher than mr fords president carters economic policies have been a disasterthey have inflation running over 13 percent productivity declining by nearly 2 percent a year mortgage interest rates at all time highs personal savings declining to below 3 v2 percent enormous trade deficits along with endless budget deficits the tax burden up by 17 percent and going higher his new budget confirms the failure of his administration yet all it gives us is more of the same let us cast aside such economic policies and do something to restore economic growth bring down prices and reduce unemployment let us fashion a budget which keeps more money in the hands of those who earn it encourages greater savings and investment and one which drastically slows the rate of nondefense government spending then and only then

198081 that is the reason i am here todayto let the people know that the democrats do not want to balance the budget through spending restraint democrats in congress want to balance the budget through massive tax increases they want to raise gas taxes income taxes social security taxes even the taxes on your savings this administration is trying to balance the budget on the backs of the people and the only thing that stands between the american people and a recess on in 198081 is the republican partys budget of hope which would restrain spending and inflation and lower tax rates to encourage economic growth these democratic tax increases are nothing newtaxes have skryocketed since carter took office with a democratic congress 3 years ago i strongly believe that the high unemployment in new york state and the northeast today is a direct result of this bankrupt policy of trying to fight inflation by deliberately slowing economic growth and putting people out of work in fact by weakening our national production it is fueling inflation republicans do not buy the idea that we can stop inflation with a recession the cause of inflation is government failure to maintain the value of the dollar and the failure of congress to reduce our devastatingly high tax rates only accelerates inflation by acting as a barrier to economic output increased production and private sector jobs i am here today to vo ce my opposition to the administrations and democratic congress attempt to balance the budget by raising taxes by more than 76 billion in 1981 when the people are struggling to keep up with 18 percent inflation the democrats propose to raise income taxes and payroll taxes by 34 billion when our savings rate falls to the lowest level since world war ii the democrats say we should increase the taxes on savings by 3 4 billion when we are paying through the nose for highpriced opec oil the democrats impose an incredible new tax on domestic oil production these massive tax increases are simply a recipe for a deeper recession than we already have the majority party policy is to make the nation poorer to make the elderly choose between food on the one hand and housing and fuel on the other and to increase the need for welfare and other public assistance at all levels of government but how axe the taxpayers going to pay for these programs if we put people out of work and continue to push them into higher and higher tax brackets if we try to balance the budget by raising taxes it just will not work we must heed the words of president kennedy who told congress in 1963 thatif we were to slide into recession through failure to act on taxes the cash deficit for next year would be larger without the tax reduction than the estimated deficit with tax reduction that is why the republican party has declared april 15 democratic tax increase day and that is why we have offered our own budget alternative which would balance the budget and cut taxes by 32 billion in

to mind a comment which those of us in public life hear quite often the comment is that there is not a dimes worth of difference between the two major political parties the republican and the democrat political parties well the american people have a right to know that in this basic document before us the budget of a free people there is indeed a fundamental difference between the alternative offered by the minority and the resolution we have put before us by the majority indeed the republican alternative which enjoys the unanimous support of the republican policy committee has five fundamental differences with the democrat budget the first is that the republican alternative offers tax cuts to the american people a 15 billion tax cut in 1980 and over the 5year projection a 100 billion tax cut the democrat alternative offers no tax cuts for the american people the second difference is that this alternative reduces the deficit further than the democrat alternative we have before us a 15 billion deficit offered by republicans as opposed to the 25 billion deficit proposed by the democrats if members could support the rousselot amendment offered the other day or if they considered supporting it it should be easier to support this corripromise because it does not go as far 1440 it does not go all the way from a 25 billion democrat deficit to zero it instead is a midpoint compromise of a 15 billion deficit the third fundamental difference between this alternative and the majoritys alternative is that the republican alternative balances the budget at a lower burden on the american people this alternative over a 5year period provides for a burden on the american people of about 18 6 percent of gnp as opposed to almost 23 percent which is the projected burden based on the democrat alternative fourth this republican alternative is different from the majority resolution in that it provides for a stronger national defense it restores most of the defense cuts fifth while slowing the growth of government this alternative nevertheless increases spending by almost 30 billion over 1979 so i appeal to my independentthinking colleagues to turn this republican alternative into a bipartisan alternative strike the word republican from the alternative by making this a bipartisan vote the british people had to go to the polls to sweep out of office the politicians who stood for high taxes and deficit spending let members of both parties of this house unite to support a compromise alternative between the rousselot amendment that lost by only a 15vote margin and the committee bill support an alternative that provides for lower taxes lower deficits and a stronger national defense if we were to adopt a meanspirited view that things must get worse before they get better that the american people must feel the pinch more before voting in a more conservative majority republicans would rejoice if a monolithic majority of democrats defeated this compromise alternative but surely people of good will on both sides of the aisle put the wellbeing of america above party so let us look beyond the party labels and vote for what many of us know

udall clausen dingell kazen brown foley and ullman but also among widely varying interests in the region including public and private utilities industry indian tribes fish and wildlife agencies consumers and local government this consensus has resulted from the recognition by the region that its unique problems in the planning and fulfillment of electric power needs for the future can best be resolved through a coordinated effort this legislation which will come in the form of a reconciled bill does provide a legislative framework which we believe was needed because of the involvement of the federal government through the bonneville power administration in transmitting and selling electrical power in the region unfortunately the once abundant and cheap hydroelectrical power generated from federal projects in the northwest no longer meets the demands of the customers it is required to serve bpa is therefore forced to decide how that cheap power is to be allocated that

area and its residents i believe the support these distinguished members have lent to this bill is a good illustration of its merits the problems however which lead to introduction of this legislation remain there are still over 60 federal state and local agencies conducting research on the chesapeake bay without an overall coordinating mechanism or guiding hand federal dollars are still being wasted as a result of the duplication of effort that stems from this disorganization but more importantly perhaps taxpayers dollars are being wasted because they are presently being poured into a system that is not leading to the solutions for the problems that confront the chesapeake bay as an illustration of this system and how it is floundering in a sea of federal dollars i would like to point out that there are presently some 18 data bases containing information data on the dynamic activities of the chesapeake at the hearings on this bill we heard from dr eugene cronin who is the executive director of the chesapeake research consortium dr cronin is a well respected scientist in the bay community and i would like to quote dr cronin on the subject of these data bases from a paper he presented to the international codata conference in palermo italy in 1978 dr cronin said that the data files and data bases in the cheapeake bay region are among the most completely documented in the world however he noted because of the existing diversity and stubborn independence of management and research entities there is no universally accepted and applied system for storage retrieval and analysis of the data related to the chesapeake bay many of these data bases are rapidly becoming outdated because they are not being maintained this situation results in a condition in which many efforts to measure record and study the activities of the bay must begin again from scratch that is part of the reason why we have 18 data bases to record many of the same figures the environmental protection agency has recently proposed the creation of the 19th data base for the bay to store the results of their current study if the epa or anyone else for that matter were to develop an overall data management system it might resemble the management resources bank that was proposed in the same study that resulted in the creation of the chesapeake research consortium in 1971 the national science foundation allocated some 1 4 million to the development of this management resources bank in 1973 and between 1970 and 1973 4 7 million was awarded in research grants to develop among other things a data bank for storage and retrieval of information on matters that would assist in the management of the bay unfortunately no such management resources bank exists and there is no data base that performs the functions outlined in the nsf grant description what dr cronin described as the existing diversity and stubborn independence of management and research entities has proven itself to be very expensive indeed the result of this confusion means simply that dangerous trends remain unabated the once plentiful rockfish is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the chesapeake the oyster harvest has been in a steady decline and crab production has been notoriously unstable in the waters that previously have known only abundance entire communities on smith island and tangier island are threatened by an erosion that many believe is the direct result of the decline in aquatic vegetation yet the causes of these various phenomena remain a mystery this disorder in the research effort perpetuates ignorance because there is no design or order to the research grants that are handed out by many federal agencies there has been little or no progress in extending basic research by an academic discipline toward information that can be of use to management and policy decisionmakers this progression or sequence of research steps never has taken place in chesapeake bay research and that is much of the reason why we still lack the answers to so many questions but this lack is not because no one knew of the need to establish a sequence of research in 1973 the national science foundation funded a research project entitled a method of applying research to environmental planning and management a case study of issues important to the chesapeake bay region this study was conducted at a cost of 73 000 and among its conclusions were the following a critical problem today is the gap between research and the use of research results for planning and management decisions this is a communications gap between research scientists and users planners and decisionmakers this gap is not the fault of either the researcher or the user it results because of the unrecognized illperceived or illdefined series of steps required to link basic knowledge with decisionmaking the research community states that projects they propose are relevant and will provide basic information for societal problems this situation exists because there are several steps between understanding what is occurring in the environment phenomenon and processes and how this information will be used for decisions this study which has been collecting dust since 1973 goes further to propose the establishment of a research plan that will insure the production of useful information for practical solutions this is the plan that is incorporated in h r 4417 and the bill is designed to formulate that research plan and to make recommendations on the funding of bay research projects by all federal departments or agencies the bill will establish an office of chesapeake bay research coordination as an independent office within the department of commerce as the members are well aware the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration is also housed in the department of commerce and has been designated to be the lead agency for the ocean pollution monitoring act the gentleman from california george brown suggested last year that the office established by this bill could become a model for other regional research efforts addressed by the ocean pollution and monitoring act the bill contains sunset language that would end this agency if it should prove unsatisfactory the office of chesapeake bay research coordination established by this bill will have several primary functions it will conduct an inventory of the past research effort to determine what has been accomplished it will develop the research plan that will set out the sequence of needed research and it will review the ongoing research activities funded by the federal government to insure that the money being spent will contribute to the solutions the chesapeake bay so desperately needs the office also will have the responsibility for identifying those areas where more research may be needed this will insure that the problems that confront the bay will come to the attention of the congress where hopefully action will result in the past erratic funding for certain research has caused a chronic discontinuity of federal attention this condition has been called impulse funding by some and has resulted in a haphazard response to the serious problems and conditions confronting the bay i want to emphasize that there are adequate safeguards in this legislation to insure that the legitimate rights of the states will not be usurped by the creation of this office a chesapeake bay research board will be established within this office to provide the expertise necessary to make the proper decisions on these technical matters the governors of maryland and virginia are given the power to appoint four members each directly to this 15 member board the secretary of commerce will appoint the other members of the board but the secretary is directed to insure that the interests of state and local government industry the public and the scientific community are represented the primary purpose of this bill is to insure that federal dollars are well spent not necessarily to expand the present federal role i would also say there is little reason to believe that this bill is a threat to the research scientists who have devoted their lives to the study of the bay its nature and problems diversity need not be eliminated through coordination a stable continuity of direction and funding will benefit the scientific community by allowing them to devote their attention to their primary calling of research rather than forcing them to divert so much of their attention to politics there is no single answer to the many problems that afflict the chesapeake sound research policies will do little good if they are not followed by sound management but there can be no rational management effort without the necessary tools in the form of accurate timely information concerning the bay our first and foremost consideration is the welfare of this vital natural and national resource and the people who use and enjoy it the fact remains that the bay faces problems for reasons that continue to allude understanding this is so despite the millions of dollars spent on research and the lives that have been devoted to unlocking these mysteries no one has disputed that this research presently lacks coordination or that coordination is necessary if the fruits of any research project are to be realized i am not interested in creating another federal office for its own sake and i have said in the past that if anyone can demonstrate that this coordination function is being carried out already i would withdraw this legislation the fact is that there is no coordination of the overall effort this legislation is needed to promote that very coordination i have heard it said that coordination is very much like heaven everybody wants to get there but not just yet well that may be true but i believe that as it relates to the problems of the chesapeake bay we cannot wait and i urge my colleagues to give this bill their favorable consideration this bill passed the house in the 95th congress and the other body failed to act on it it has been improved in this congress and a consensus has been achieved between the two states as mentioned earlier this is important legislation which needs to be passed in order to improve the effectiveness and the coordination of our federal research efforts in the chesapeake bay this is a very important ecosystem and by better coordination of the research we can achieve wiser use and management of the bay thank you the

through fiscal year 1982 the programs under the economic development administration the title v regional commissions and the appalachian regional commission this bill passed the other body on september 26 it is a result of the breakdown in deliberations between the house and senate conferees on s 914 the conference could not agree to terms of amendments to these programs so we have decided to extend the current law through fiscal year 1982 and try again to produce amendments to these acts agreeable to both bodies since its enactment in 1965 the public works and economic development act has been broadened by a succession of amendments that among other things added programs directed to economic recovery for disaster areas title viii special economic adjustment assistance for areas experiencing or anticipating significant structural economic dislocations especially those resulting from federal activities title ix and job opportunities emergency assistance to areas suffering from unusually high levels of unemployment title x although titles viii and x are dormant they did serve a purpose and addressed immediate needs in addition other legislation gave eda administrative responsibilities over related programs the trade act of 1974 authorized programs to aid communities and firms impacted by foreign imports and the public works employment act of 1976 and 1977 authorized 100percent grants for the local public works program this act was a major piece of antirecession legislation to help state and local governments accelerate economic recovery by targeting local public works construction programs in areas of high unemployment the eda statement of purpose has been broadened over the years from aras original mission which in turn had evolved from a proposal in 1955 by the late senator paul douglas senator douglas concluded that the rapid expansion of postwar technology was resulting in structural as opposed to cyclical dislocations that created areas of high unemployment low per capita income outmigration and declines in business activity and social capital investment the original intent was to aid chronically depressed industrial areas with an emphasis on business loans to assist firms located in such areas early in 1965 the comprehensive appalachian regional development act was passed to help reverse the longstanding economic deterioration of this region of our country recognizing that problems of economic development often transcend state lines congress embarked upon a concept of regional economic development this legislation created a federalstate partnership to deal with and find remedies to economic development problems that extended beyond state boundaries such as the construction of a developmental highway system to provide access to isolated sections of the region and to make possible a flow of industry and tourism within the region during consideration of this legislative initiative it was decided that the progress of the entire nation depended greatly on the improvement of those areas which were distressed or underdeveloped in order to alleviate the distress or depressed areas in america the economic development legislation was designed to authorize grants and loans for public works and development facilities loans and loan guarantees for industrial and commercial expansion technical assistance research and information and financial aid to planning agencies at the multicounty district and regional levels this proposal encouraged the local people to develop the necessary ingredients through planning and the recognition of their needs for longrange economic growth the economic development act was based on the past experience and contained features of the accelerated public works program the area redevelopment administration and appalachia regional development commission it was one of the major pieces of legislation passed by the 89th congress and it contained an authorization of funds 760 million per year for 4 years the need for broad political support led however to adding special provisions for loans to firms in lowincome rural areas and to increased funding for public works amendments over the years have added new eligibility criteria notably the farbstein amendment which provided eligibility to pockets of distress in otherwise healthy areas such pockets could be as small as a city block these impact areas did not need oedp but could rely on immediate construction projects to alleviate unemployment additionally the public works impact program added in 1971 authorized between 15 and 35 percent of title i grants for construction projects to act as a permanent countercyclical program for high unemployment areas eda did meet resistance in reauthorization efforts in 1971 and 1973 the administration proposed to dismantle the agency and replace it with special revenue sharing 1971 and block grants to states 1973 ultimately in 1974 congress added a new title ix to address economic adjustment assistance plant closures in single industry towns and military base closings were two types of action needing adjustment assistance for affected communities in march 1979 the subcommittee on economic development began hearings on h r 2063 the extension of the public works and economic development act we first heard from two noted economists commenting on the role of public works construction in economic development the subcommittee held 8 days of hearings the last 2 days april 24 and 25 devoted to administration witnesses commenting on the national public works and economic development act of 1979 npweda the submission of this bill to congress was late giving the subcommittee very little time to review the bill the membership ultimately thought so little of it no one introduced the bill for referral to the committee the subcommittee heard over 40 witnesses on the subjects and began deliberation in may for a bill h r 2063 reported may 11 contained amendments to the public works and economic development act title v regional commissions appalachian regional commission and authorized a standby program for local public works amendments to eda contained some of the administrations draft bill specifically the committee included the new loan guarantee program for 1 8 billion in fiscal year 1980 and 2 5 billion for fiscal year 1981 it also contained new authority for 15percent grants to businesses new criteria in addition to existing criteria and increased funding for all planning programs additionally the committee took initiatives to include a gasohol program and defense related amendments for titles iv and ix a revolving grant program for cities and changes in administration of the program the committee also amended the title v commission program to reflect the need for better fiscal management to recognize new economic conditions under which commissions function and to create a planning relationship with state and local entities the appalachian regional commission authority was extended for 2 years with the highway program extended for 4 years the commission authority was changed to add enterprise development grants housing aid innovative project grants and coal gasification plant assistance finally title iv of h r 2063 amended the local public works capital development and investment act of 1976 as amended by authorizing 2 billion on a standby basis whenever the average national unemployment rate exceeded 6 5 percent for the most recent calendar quarter this lpw program originally authorized in 1976 2 billion to combat high unemployment it provided 100percent grants to states and local governments to construct public facilities in 1977 the act was amended to add an additional 4 billion for the same purpose the committee chose to provide standby authority for this program the work done by the public works and transportation committee came under challenge by the banking committees subcommittee on economic stabilization this subcommittee reviewed the administrations draft eda bill introduced it for consideration and began a markup of it however in the spirit of cooperation the banking committee chose not to confront the public works committee over jurisdictional matters in november 1979 the house by a vote of 301 to 99 accepted h r 2063 on a vote of 148 to 250 it rejected efforts to delete the standby authority for local public works the house position was clear it wanted h r 2063 as reported by the committee with the local public works standby authority in december conferees of both the house and senate began deliberations to resolve differences in the two versions the house version a 2year extension with lpw authorized over 8 6 billion plus 4 3 billion in loan guarantee authority the senate version contained an extension of 4 years for these programs except the loan program which now has the jurisdiction of the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee that committee decided on a 2year extension for all loan programs except the interest subsidy program which was extended for only 1 year the conference committee met four times in december but could not agree on the major differences of the bills the conference did not meet again until late july and met again in september time ran out without an agreement i reluctantly proposed in the last conference meeting on september 18 to dissolve the conference and each committee pass an extension of the regular program under consideration through fiscal year 1981
