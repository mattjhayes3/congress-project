interest whatsoever the next year they receive 32 000 000 and the fifth year 47 000 000 during this period of five jears they pay us 25 000 000 and they get from german reparations a total of 134 000

from 1960 to 1970 threefourths of 1 per cent interest and from 1970 to 1980 1 per cent interest and for the last seven years 2 per cent interest on the average that makes fortytwo onehundredths of 1 per cent interest they are paying us i do not want to criticize the italian government nor the italian people but i think in justice to our own taxpayers my friends there ought to be some consideration and some friendly feeling toward our own taxpayers especially in view of the fact you are trying to show so much consideration to foreign taxpayers if you please fortytwo onehundredths of 1 per cent interest and what does this debt settlement mean my friends it does not mean 2 042 000 000 i asked secretary mellon when he was on the witness stand what was the present value of this debt settlement and he said 538 000 000 or in other words a cancellation my friends of one and a half billion dollars during these five years i have been talking about without italy paying interest and paying only 5 000 000 a year our taxpayers pay 400 000 000 on this same debt in interest or in taxes if you please if seems to me the time has come when we should consider the american taxpayers a little bit but the great burden of the song of the gentleman from georgia and the gentleman from new york is that italy has not the capacity to pay and can not possibly pay any more than this debt settlement calls for i sometimes wonder you know when people are trying to borrow money they go on dress parade and they show the value of their assets and they borrow money in that way when they are trying to get a debt canceled or scaled down they put on a long face and they come to our debt commission and put it over on them i wonder if the debt commission had the same figures presented to them by the italian government when the italian government was trying to get us to cancel this debt that they presented j p morgan co when they borrowed 100 000 000 at 7 per cent with the trimmings if you please because those bonds were taken by j p morgan co at 94 and they draw 7 per cent on the par value i wonder if our commission evei had the figures or ever saw the figures which were presented to j p morgan co when they made this loan of 100 000 000 our commission can not be heard to say they knew nothing about this loan or rather this prospective loan they can not be heard to say that why do i say that because the newspapers were full of it every day or two and the newspapers were referring to the fact the italian government was going to negotiate a big loan with j p morgan co therefore they should have known or they should have found out something about what they were saying when they were trying to borrow this money and not pay so much attention to what they said when they were trying to get our commission to cancel this debt to the extent of 75 per cent this is not all they say italy has not the capacity to pay why do they say that my friends they can not say that and tell this house and the country it is the fact not at all i say here today that they took the figures absolutely of the italian debt commission upon the capacity of italy to pay italy is a great country they boast they are the greatest country on the globe i presume all countries do that italy has 40 000 000 of people and she has more water power than any other like area on the globe if you please and the people of america are finding out now what it means to have a great deal of water power italy is worth not 22 000 000 000 but she is worth any where from 35 000 000 000 to 40 000 000 000 that is what the capacity of italy is anywhere from 35 000 000 000 to 40 000 000 000 of wealth if you please they owe us 2 000 000 000 they owe great britain 2 450 000 000 about 10 per cent of the wealth of italy we ourselves in this country owe about 20 000 000 000 the commission did not want to tell this but the italian commission gave several reasons why they were so handicapped in trying to pay this great debt to our country and one was the hightariff policy of america they could not sell us goods op account of our tariff laws and they could not pay their debt unless they could sell us goods but this administration and this debt commission would rather cancel this debt up to 100 per cent rather than reduce the fordneymccumber law onetenth of 1 per cent that is the situation we find they do not want to do something that will help the italian people and at the same time help the american people what they want to do is to cancel this debt i am surprised that they did not cancel all the debt and they would have if they thought that they could have gotten away with it on the floor of the house and the senate they seem to have a great deal of sympathy for the foreign taxpayers but not for our taxpayers i call attention to the fact that the taxpaying time is coming soon and in every state of this union the farmers are going to have to borrow money to pay these taxes or their farms and livestock will be sold for taxes unless they have the cash with which to pay they will get no 75 per cent of cancellation on their taxes we hear not a word of sympathy for our poor taxpayers in dire distress in our great agricultural sections the gentleman from new york talks about how many calories the italian people eat what kind of clothes they wear i know nothing about it and i do not think lie does either he has got some phony figures from the department of labor and they can fix up more phony figures down there than any place in this country the departments of commerce and labor fixed up the phony figures which the president used in his tariff speech to the farmers at chicago recently but he did not fool the farmers with them what about italys capacity to pay she does not owe

the terms of which for 16 years no man woman or child in nebraska has ever lost a dollar of deposits while we are talking about something in behalf of the people of the agricultural zones do not you think we ought to give them some relief along that line i am in favor of any kind of agricultural relief but i can not think of anything more happy in the line of relief than that class of legislation

and the secretary of wardid issue the permit nothing was said in the act of march 3 1899 about diversion of water and because the secretary of war issued the permit to illinois and the sanitary district they plead that we are estopped from pleading that they did not have authority to divert water i want to say that if we settle this diversion now and pass the bill authorizing 8 250 feet of water the damage will have been done and they will win their case in the supreme court of the united states because as i read the opinion it says that it is a case of interstate commerce and the government of the united states can not take away from themselves the power of exercising police powers i say that we are not estopped but if congress acts and legalizes 8 250 secondfeet of water the supreme court will say this is the intent of congress and when the case comes up in the supreme court next october we will have no rights in the case inasmuch as illinois will not lose anything if they wait until next winter if they are honest if that is the only thing they are after let them wait until next winter let the judges decide the case on its merits and not let us lose our case in
