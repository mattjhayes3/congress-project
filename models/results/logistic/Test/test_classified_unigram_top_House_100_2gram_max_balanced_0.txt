for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings

economic incentives to the sandinista government to negotiate a peaceful settlement with them this measure also authorizes funds for the contadora peace process and urges the president to resume bilateral talks with the nicaraguan government and to persuade other central american nations to join with the united states in using economic sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing to fight for it than to pay for war with our own blood on a far larger scale once that beachhead has grown into a monstrous threat that cannot be stopped in any other way i urge the adoption of the

elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity

something to those who donate to our campaigns and those feelings play a large role in how we conduct ourselves as legislators it is no wonder then that public confidence in the integrity of elected officials is so low a cbs new york times survey following the 1984 elections found that only 40 percent of the public believed that government is run for the benefit of all the people onehalf of the respondents to that survey expressed the view that government is mainly run by a few big interests looking out for themselves not surprisingly a harris poll taken that same year found that 70 percent of those surveyed disapproved of candidates for high federal office taking pac funds in recent years a number of solutions have been proposed to solve the problems raised by our current campaign system those proposals have included such ideas as adjustments in the various contribution limits constitutional amendments to impose spending limits tax credits to promote individual contributions to candidates or parties limits on pac donations and matching public funds for congressional candidates but all of these offer only partial solutions only full public financing provides the element indispensable to true candidate independence the assurance of sufficient funds to wage a viable campaign without having to appeal to and depend on specialinterest contributors what we are proposing today is not a radical new plan it is merely an expansion of what has been the law of the land for presidential races for 15 years we have had three elections for president under this system and it has been completely successful in freeing candidates from any reliance on specialinterest money our legislation would simply pick up where congress left off in 1971 and extend this system to house candidates in general elections under our bill each majorparty nominee for the house who has a majorparty opponent would be entitled to a grant of 200 000 in federal funds for his or her general election campaign a candidate who accepts the funding would then be limited to spending only that 200 000 on his general election campaign he could not accept any funds from pacs or from individuals nor could he use any of his own money minorparty and newparty candidates would also be provided with federal funds but in lesser amounts the amounts would be based on the same formula as that used in the presidential system minorparty candidates would receive an amount proportionate to the vote they received in relationship to the majorparty candidates in prior elections newparty candidates would be eligible for retroactive funding if they received at least 5 percent of the vote a candidate could opt to decline the public financing and instead raise and spend any amount of money however for every dollar he raises incurs or spends above 200 000 his opponent would receive a dollar in federal funds thus no matter how much money he spends on his campaign his opponent could spend an identical amount that way there would be no advantage for a candidate who is able to raise a great deal of money privately in order to ensure that a publicly financed candidate has at his disposal the same amount of funding as his privately financed opponent privately financed candidates would be required to file reports of receipts and expenditures at frequent intervals during the campaignmonthly up to 60 days before the election weekly from 59 to 11 days prior to the election and daily during the 10 days preceding the election funding for house campaigns would be provided through the taxpayer check off on federal income tax return forms that is now used to direct revenue to the presidential election campaign fund if there were two majorparty candidates in every congressional district and each spent his entire 200 000 entitlement federal funding would amount to 175 million each election cycle or 87 5 million on an annual basis however the exact cost in any election cycle would depend on how many candidates are unopposedand therefore ineligible for fundshow many choose private financing how many spend less than their allotment and how many minorparty and newparty candidates become eligible for funds our bill covers general elections only campaigns for primary elections would continue to be financed privately a candidate who chose public financing for the general election could not spend unused primary funds during his general election campaign finally our bill includes an additional provision intended to reduce campaign media costs television and radio stations would be required to offer candidates nonpreemptible time at the lowest preemptible rate offered for that class of time during the preceding 12 months this provision would implement the intent of the existing lowest unit rate law for purchase of broadcast time in closing i would like to respond to two concerns which have traditionally been raised in opposition to public financing protection of incumbents and cost opponents argue that if challengers and incumbents are held to the same level of funding the incumbent will have a builtin advantage anyone who supports public financing will concede that there may well be a handful of races in which a challenger is hampered by not being able to spend more than the incumbent but by and large congressional elections will be much more competitive than they are now if challengers and incumbents have the same amount of money at their disposal the fact is under our current system incumbents are almost always able to raise much more money than their opponents can raise in 1984 the average amount spent by an incumbent was 259 000 while the average amount a challenger spent was only 121 000 because figures tor 1986 are expected to show a similarif not greaterimbalance in spending by incumbents and challengers it is not surprising that 98 percent of the house incumbents who sought reelection last year were successful except unusual cases public financing would benefit not hamper challengers opponents also complain about the cost of public financing especially at a time when huge recurring federal budget deficits are forcing us to closely examine every federal expenditure but ifwe put the cost in perspective 87 5 millionthe approximate annual costis a very tiny amount in a 1 trillion federal budget furthermore that amount is significantly less than the sum we used to pay indirectly for political contributions because it is only onethird of the amount of revenue the treasury lost annually through the tax credit for political contributions that was just abolished last year moreover i think the question of cost should be turned around is there any doubt that taxpayers pay far more than 85 million a year in the form of special tax breaks and programs which are enacted to benefit the specialinterest groups which now finance the campaigns of our elected officials viewed in that light i would argue that public financing might be the single most important step we could take in our efforts to get the federal budget under control it is a measure we cannot afford not to pass our proposal offers the opportunity to remove much of the specialinterest money from our campaigns lower spending in a great many congressional races and provide relief from the everincreasing and neverending burden of raising campaign fundsand to vastly increase public confidence in the electoral process and in elected house members i urge our colleagues to join in support of this important legislation"], [0.00010865926742553711,

should dispel ourselves of the notion that we are in this problem because of good farmers and bad farmers we are not there is certainly nothing in the proposed amendments that would tell us what a good farmer is versus what a bad farmer is many farmers are in this situation where they are not current on their loans or they are simply there because they inherited a farm with a large debt or they are there because they were in a particular commodity that no one could foresee what would happen with or they are there because of loss of foreign markets in some instances or they are there because of getting caught in an interest rate pinch they are not there because they happen to be bad farmers i think that is a total misconception second i think as the gentleman from louisiana adequately pointed out the notion that we are going to save the federal government money by kicking people off land and doing something with the property once we have foreclosed that is completely fallacious the fact is the federal government will not make any money by taking the property over through the farmers home administration they will sell it for a serious loss there is absolutely no guarantee that any better farmer will come along and be able to manage it under any circumstances better than it was managed before i say to my colleagues do not forget the social cost of taking someone off the property removing them from their house and hoping they can get a job and feed their family while working somewhere else it just will not work the best thing to do is restructure in this industry as we have restructured in other troubled industries give these people a chance to do the job they intended to do there in the first place and let the system work it will be less expensive than the

lands bill contains one provision the arizonaflorida land exchange which i find so objectionable that i must oppose the entire bill despite some changes made by the senate the arizonaflorida land exchange remains fundamentally flawed the bottom line is that this exchange was put together to give one developer the colliers a special deal on the phoenix indian school property the proponents of this bill argue it is needed to protect endangered park and wildlife habitat in florida but those lands are already protected from most development so what is the federal government buying were buying nothing and what are we giving away for nothing according to the general accounting office were giving up one of the most valuable parcels of land in the western united states this land exchange remains riddled with loopholes which favor the colliers some of the worst problems are the bill does not require the colliers to hold marketable title for all the florida lands by colliers estimate were pyrchasing at least 4 000 acres of swamp land that is below mean high tide and may be owned by the state of florida not by the colliers the colliers retain all oil and gas rights to the florida lands as a consequence the only real threat to the florida lands oil and gas exploration and development remains surveys and appraisals were not made of all the specific lands being exchanged in flori da the colliers are not required to make a lumpsum cash payment instead the secretary of the interior is given the discretion to permit the colliers to make their cash payment over 30 years the only way to ensure that the federal government receives fair market value from the sale of the indian school is to use an open competitive bidding process unfortunately the senate bill is even worse than the house bill in this respect a provision added in the senate permits the colliers to be the sole bidder for the phoenix property the arizonaflorida land exchange is rotten to the core it should be rejected i urge you to vote against s 2840 i also would like to take this opportunity to address language in this with respect to water rights i have very serious reservations about the water rights language which has been included on the sections establishing the city of rocks national reserve and the hagerman fossil beds national monument in idaho i fully support the basic goals of these provisions which are to manage and protect the nationally significant historic and natural resources within these areas however i have sedous reservations about the language concerning water rights i have agreed not to oppose the water rights language only because of the unique circumstances surrounding these areas and because this language will have no impact on the areas not will it affect other units of the national park system or future park designations i would like to take this opportunity to discuss these provisions and the reasons for their inclusion these provisions expressly deny any federal reserved water right to the new national park units created by the legislation this is of course a departure from the normal process in which a reservation of water is created by implication whenever congress establishes a unit of the national park system under a wellestablished legal doctrine an implied reservation of water sufficient to fulfill the purposes for which the land is reserved arises when congress or the executive branch reserves land for a specific purpose by including the language in the city of rocks and hagerman areas the congress does not intend for this exception to undercut the rights associated with previous reservations nor to establish any precedent with regard to future reservations rather the language in this legislation is merely a unique approach to a unique situation neither the city of rocks riot the hagerman areas contain any perennial streams moreover the values for which these areas are being designated are not water dependent in the case of hagerman fossil beds the values are paleontological the area is on the oregon trail and was a major stopover point in the westward migration of thousands of pioneers in the 19th century the area is very popular for rock climbing because of the excellent granite spires pillars rims and boulders thus there are no waterdependent resources or values requiring the protection that is afforded by a federal reserve water right in t he case of city of rocks the area will be managed cooperatively with the state of idaho and the state has agreed to supply any water that is required for visitor facilities given these circumstances even without this disclaimer of any federal reserved water rights it is unlikely the federal government would need to seek a federal water right for these
