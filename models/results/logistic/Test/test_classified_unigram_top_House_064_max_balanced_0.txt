feeling between the employer and the employee there should be a more manifest interest on behalf of the employer in the general welfare of his employee there should be a more manifest interest on the part of the employee in the welfare and prosperity of his employers business this estrangement that seems to have grown up between capital and labor within the last few years occurring perhaps principally within the last 25 years is i believe very largely due to the fact that there is seemingly such a wide difference between the employer and the employee when the industries of this country were few and the number of employees was not so great when the employer was closer to the men he employed than he is now there was a minimum of labor trouble as our industries expanded and as the number of employees increased there was a difference which increased in proportion between the employer and the employee the bond of sympathy that comes by reason of close touch seems not to obtain because of this growth and as an unfortunate consequence the time has come in this country when it is said with a great deal of truth that the employer has little interest in th e general welfare of the employee and the employee has little interest in the general welfare of his employers business that he is willing to quit when his time is up without reference to what he has accomplished for the man who gives him employment upon the other side criticism has been made and perhaps with some justice that the nan who employs labor has no sympathy that lie has lost his heart that he has lost that sense of human touch that should exist between men no matter whether they be employees or employers i believe that the character of legislation which is now proposed will be the conimcting link that will bring the employer and employee closer together than any other thing that might happen i believe when it is known by the masses who are the employees that the legislators of this country are providing a way whereby the employer and employees are brought closer together that the employee and employer will have a closer bond of sympathy for each other when it is known that provision is made whereby out of the earnings of the employer there is going to be compensation to the employee in the event that lie is injured then will there arise the condition that should be between the employer and employee and the employee will show that he has an interest in the employers business aid his success and that interest will be mutual it is said that this is going to cost somebody something all good things cost somebody something and the people in the end will get the benefit of it it is a question whether or not it is for the best interest of the people of the united states to contribute from their share what it will cost to put the machinery into existence and to maintain it and whether it is not best to my mind it is purely an economic question and every person in the united states
