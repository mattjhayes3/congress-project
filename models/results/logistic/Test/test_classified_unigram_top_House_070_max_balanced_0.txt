chairman and gentlemen i imagine that our constituents back home do not differ from other constituents ainy more than we their representatives differ from one another yet however different they may be i imagine that upon several fundamentals so far as legislation in this congress is concerned we would find all of them in agreement so far as waste and extravagance and economy are concerned we would find them of one indul in public affairs they want to waste they want no extravagance and they want sane economy they do not want foolish economy they want sane economy and sane expenditure of public money i imagine they would be in hearty agreement on the subject of affording some sort of definite relief to the producers of the countryto the farmers and stockmneninot something merely to be spent in their name all of the money that congress has spent which it has been appropriating for the agricultural department has been spent to increase production and that is tile very thing that the farmers are sufferintg from today they suffer from increatsed production none of the proposals that we have passed in behalf of agriculture in the way of farm relief has been to give to the farmer the benefit of that surplus the menaryhaugen bill did not propose to give the farmers the benefit of tiny profit that could be derived from the surplus when handled by the organization that we provided for the profits that were to be derived front the holding and sale of surplus were not to be divided among the farmers they were to get no part of it i take it also that our people would be in hearty accord and agreement upon the proposition that we must afford them better railroad facilities in transporting commodities that is lower freight rates i think our tariffs are higher than they should be the producers in my section of the country frequently send their products to nmarket and thefreight tariffs cost then more than they receive in such fundamentals it occurs to me that all of our constituents are of one mind and that there should be some relief i do not knew whether or not you gentlemen keep your ears close to the ground in respect to what your people are thinking about and how they feel on public subjects there were 314 000 people in the last census in my district the seventeenth district of texas and over 350 000 people now live there those 350 000 people living in my district today can speak collectively only through their political conventions that is the only way in which they can voice their sentiments collectively when the democrats of my district speak when they say we the democrats of the seventeenth congressional district that means we the people of the seventeenth district because in my district the people are practically all democrats there are a few republicans and i will say here that the few white ones down there in my district are splendid men men of good judgment men who are the very best of citizens but there are verf few of them so i say that when the democrats speak collectively in convention they speak for the people of my district i want now to call your attention to how they expressed themselves on some public questions in the last convention in which they met in my district on august 28 1926 that is the last time they spoke as delegates selected from the conventions in all of the 19 counties in my district they met in convention on august 28 1926 and expressed themselves definitely on some of these important questions of legislation that we have had before congress and i now call your attention to some of their expressions among other things they resolved 3 that our junior senator has been a luxury too costly and expensire to the people to be continued in office longer than his six years there having been spent out of the public treasury 65 984 61 in the contest over his seat and on february 23 1926 senator mayfield had the senate pay him the additional sum of 30 500 as his own personal expenses 4 that we can not approve of the action of senator mayfield in voting february 28 1925 to raise his own salary for the term of office to which he had already been elected 5 that we can not approve of the action of senator mayfield in supporting the parker bill that deprived the american people of all voice and representation around the council table in railroad disputes 6 that we can not approve of the action of senator mayfield in supporting the haugen bill which would have wasted 375 000 000 to begin with would have unjustly taxed southern cotton and promised no real relief to southern farmers those people are not much different from your people they are the same kind of people they are american citizens interested in public questions they have the right to express themselves on national legislation and national affairs and right here on that haugen bill what are we going to do about farm relief this year are we going to let the senate say to us that we can not pass in this house and get it through any measure except the socalled mcnaryhaugen bill and nolie other are we again going to be told that i have been here long enough to know that every agricultural bill that we pass any farm relief measure that we pass here will be known as the mcnaryhaugen bill under our system every bill of that importance that comes from the committee on agriculture is going to bear the name of the chairman of the house committee and the name of the chairman of the senate committee the tax bill that we passed here recently illustrates that we all know as a matter of fact that it is a jack garner bill but it is known as the green measure because forsooth mr grami of iowa is chairman of the committee no matter whose impress is put upon the measure it is known by the name of the chairman i remember when that mcnaryhaugen bill was first introduced in 1924 if you will compare the 1924 bill with the 1927 bill of the same name you would hardly recognize the two as coming from the same source if you compare the 1924 bill with the 1926 bill and then with the 1927 bill which we passed last year you will see that we forced many important changes to be made as the years have passed yet they were all known as menaryhaugen bills the first bill that was introduced by mr haugen in 1924 provided for no relief for cotton one of the greatest agricultural commodities raised in this country when i asked the distinguished chairman from iowa why cotton was left out he said the cotton producers did not want it in they recognized that there was nothing definite in the way of relief for cotton in it but in 1926 when he wanted his bill passed and knew that he had to get the cotton representatives in line with him enough of them to pass it he put cotton in what lid he then provide he provided that there should be an equalization tax of 2 per bale because he knew if you taxed the cotton farmers more than 2 a bale their representatives would not stand for it and would not vote for the bill yet we realized at that time that an equalization fee of less than 5 or even 10 a bale on cotton would hardly accomplish anything beneficial for cotton yet they restricted it to 2 a bale and put a provision in the bill that the board could raise it if they saw fit and they would have raised it to 10 or 15 before they got through we all know what else did they first provide in the menaryhaugen bill they provided that the farmer who failed to pay this equalization tax could be fined 5 000 and sent to a federal prison for a year that is that the producer the man whom they were seeking to help could be thus penalized if he saw fit not to pay a tax on his commodity naturally some of us rebelled and before the bill got through we forced that provision out of the bill the 1927 bill did not retain that provision it did not penalize the farmer it did not propose to fine him 5 000 and send him to a federal prison for a year there was another important change we caused by fighting against that first bill the first bill was to waste 375 000 000 certainly that much we caused the framers of that bill to reduce it 125 000 000 when they brought the 1927 bill in why is it that we can not provide a bill here for the welfare of the farmers that will see to it that the profit which is derived from properly marketing their surplus is distributed back among the farmers who raised it whenever you bring a bill into this house of that character i think you will find every representative of farmers here supporting it heartily the other bill did not do it why can we not get to work and pass the kind of a bill that our farmer friend from kansas mr tincher advocatedour farmer friend who used to be a leader on this floor for the administration whenever the administration was embarrassed 6r bothered instead of calling on jim bgo as they do now they called on tincher they kept tincher on the floor all the time to protect the administration and especially to protect the farming interests you remember tincher brought in here a bill which was a good honesttogod farmers measure when he first introduced it it was to do away with gambling in farm futures it was to stop it altogether and if that bill had been passed it would have benefited every farmer in the united states far more than the mcnaryhaugen bill could have promised in any respect but when tincher got through with his bill when the interests got through with tinchers bill it was not stock gambling in the daytime that was stopped but only gambling at night when the gamblers were sleeping i have introduced another bill here which would stop gambling in futures on cotton grain wool and mohair in the daytime and in the nighttime too it will stop all such gambling in farm products will you support it i hope you will"], [0.02016139030456543, 0.9798386096954346, 1, "i can not i have only 10 minutes if the gentleman has any questions and will submit them in writing i will answer them later when i have more time at my disposal if the private interests build the dam they will charge such a rate for the electrical energy as to make the consuming public pay for the dam in a little while and then the corporation which has built the dam will still own it they will continue to charge that amount for the electrical energy and make the consuming public pay for it in full again and again and again every few years as time rolls on all kinds of arguments are being made against the construction of the dam one faulty argument is that if you build a dam under the terms of this bill it will bring about the production of a large amount of cotton in the imperial valley thereby causing an overproduction and consequently low prices the construction of a floodcontrol dam used for irrigation purposes will produce just as much cotton in the imperial valley as a dam built under this bill the construction of a dam by private interests which they are willing to build will bring about the production of the same amount of cotton that the construction of the dam under the terms of this bill will bring about my people are cotton growers and having their welfare at heart and not wanting them to be misled and not wanting southern members of congress misled on this proposition i wish to discuss rather fully the cottonproduction phase of this proposition from time to time we have heard suggestions from those who are opposing the boulder dam and the allamerican canal that the construction of this great project would mean an increased production of cotton along the lower colorado river and particularly in imperial valley we are told that our people of the south should oppose the measure on this ground that if the boulder dam and the allamerican canal should not be built then the south is saved this competition in 1927 the alabama press association after its members had been told that the boulder dam project would mean enormous competition in the production of cotton passed a resolution opposing the project upon that ground let us see about the matter along about 1910 cotton was introduced into imperial valley and was found to be quite successful 4 the same time it was introduced into the imperial valley on he mexican side of the international line and was found to be equally successful but with the decided advantage of unusually cheap labor the labor consisting mostly of orientals and native mexicans the reports indicate that in the fiveyear period of 1922 to 1927 more than 4 400 chinese laborers alone were imported into this section of mexico during the stimulus of the war cotton planting increased on both sides of the line very materially until in 1920 there was slightly more than 100 000 acres in cotton in imperial valley calif and almost 200 000 in mexico after the war however cotton production on the american side because of the cost of labor cost of irrigation water and other items reduced the acreage materially from year to year so that in 1924 the acreage in imperial valley calif had dropped to 75 801 in 1925 to 47 253 in 1926 to 23 693 and the acreage in 1927 was only 20 300 out of some 400 000 acres in general crops on the mexican ide we find a slight reduction in 1924 or 170 126 acres in cotton in 1925 197 430 acres in 1926 145 348 acres and in 1927 11 2 015 acres during the year 1925 there was ginned in the imperial valley calif 10 500 bales as against 84 331 bales immediately across the line in mexico in 1926 there were ginned in imperial valley calif 6 838 bales as against 84 842 bales across the line in mexico a report of december 31 last as published in the glexico chronico a newspaper published in imperial valley indicates that for the present season up to that date there had been ginned in mexico 25 206 bales as against 2 733 bales for imperial valley calif in 1920 there were 22 cotton gins in operation in imperial valley calif and in 1927 there were only 4 these figures all indicate that cotton production in mexico is somewhat of an established fact but in imperial valley calif it never has been a serious factor and is very much on the decline the reason for this is obvious imperial valley has a 12 months growing season they irrigate their crops every month in the year they have long hot summers and sunshine practically all of the time this condition is ideal for the growing of fruits and winter vegetables and for growing two or more crops per year on the same parcel of ground with these conditions with the long summers and the abundant sunshine catalyzed crops of high value can be as easily produced as crops of lower value the lands are reclaimed from the desert which requires a considerable expenditure of money therefore land values are reasonably high labor cost in that region is necessarily high and since all moisture must be artificially applied a great deal of money is necessarily expended for irrigation works and irrigation service and yet the land will produce little if any more cotton per season than will a similar area of land in the southern states where the expense of production is only a fraction of the cost in imperial valley mr r b vail president of the alabama press association visited the imperial valley in november 1927 for the express purpose of obtaining firsthand information on this subject and the los angeles examiner of november 26 1927 contained a news story following an interview with mr vail wherein we take it mr vail is correctly quoted mr vail in his interview with the correspondent of the examiner at the rosslyn hotel in los angeles and on various occasions and to numerous persons since has repeatedly called attention to the false propaganda circulated throughout the south that realization of the boulder dam project would mean southwestern cotton competition he has invariably declared that there is no foundation for any fear of competition from cotton growers as a result of the boulder dam and that the deliberate purpose to deceive is the only reason for the circulation of such false propaganda mr vail declares his purpose to prevent so far as possible these false reports and newspaper items doing a rank injustice to the cause of those seeking the passage of legislation to authorize the construction of boulder dam he points out that there is no likelihood of any bulk production of cotton in the southwest that might damage the cotton interest of the south mr vail and all the rest of us who have visited southern california found that the lands in imperial valley which would be irrigated as a result of this dam are entirely too valuable and too expensive to be used in the production of cotton with the expensive labor of southern california this land is extremely fertile and is very valuable for the production from january to january of cantaloupes and all other forms of vegetables and fruits the farmers of this valley can not pay for their lands pdy for their labor and for all their water and produce cotton at a price below 40 or 50 cents a pound except on very small areas of land temporarily not used for fruits or vegetables following his visit to california mr vail reported his findings to the association of which he was president and in january 1928 the alabama press association by resolution again spoke upon this subject rescinding their former resolution and stating that there appeared to be no reason for them to oppose the legislation because of danger to the cotton growers of the south in an article published in the macon telegraph on sunday january 1 1928 and also in the journalherald of waycross ga mr nelson m shipp told of his trip to the imperial valley and to that portion of mexico watered now by the colorado river he gave it as his opinion after a month of careful firsthand investigation that this region is not now and never will become a cotton competitor of the south i visited this section last summer and i fully agree with mr shipp and all others who have given an imnpartial firsthand study of this problem that there is no chance of cotton competition by the west as against the south cotton is planted in the imperial valley as a side crop or to wash the alkali out of the soil through irrigation cotton is not the money crop of the west and no amount of irrigation will make it such mr shipp pointed out that georgia produces some wheat but will never become a wheat competitor of the west and while the west produces some cotton it will never be in sufficient quantities to injure the price of cotton grown in the south while the building of the boulder dam in connection with the allamerican canal will stabilize and make dependable the water supply for irrigation purposes in the imperial valley and will make possible the irrigation in time of some additional lands of the same general character at the same time the construction of this project will make possible a definite limitation on expansion of uses of water in mexico where cotton farming is now and has been for some time past the principal crop the failure to construct these works means continued expansion of the mexican production as at the prescut time imperial valley is of necessity at the lower end of the canal which first supplies mexico with water in order to take water through mexico it was necessary to enter into a contract with that country wherebyonehalf of the water should be left there for use under this contract mexico has the perfect right to double its present use and she has the lands sufficient to increase her production four times it is an irony of circumstances that a small orient is being built up in mexico on our border supported by the great white staple of the south which in turn is produced on a paternalistic basis with irrigation water transported for miles at a large cost by reluctant american farmers under an old concession from diaz the american farmers of the imperial valley ran their mainline irrigation canal 60 miles through mexico with the agreement that lands in mexico should be entitled to onehalf of all the water flowing through the canal for every acre irrigated in the united states the mexicans were due water for an acre in mexico years have passed and the present finds some 200 000 acres in mexico irrigated from this water supply as against some 400 000 acres in the united states applications from mexico for irrigation including the lands now being supplied have grown to over 400 000 acres the charge on the american side for the water has gradually increased whereas the mexican charge remains at a low arbitrary figure thus farming in mexico is not based on natural and ordinary laws that should figure in competition but chinese coolies are growing cotton at the expense of american taxpayers in the west as a result of our studies we find that instead of the boulder dam project increasing cotton production it will limit the same and such cotton as is produced will not be produced on unfaircompetition grounds with the imperial valley producing in 1926 6 838 bales of cotton as against 17 750 000 produced in the united states and with cotton production becoming less annually it is only a fair conclusion that the cotton interests of the south can not be injured by the developments which will take place in that coinmtnity under the boulder dam project and indeed their injury if any will be found in the failure to build rather than in the building of the same the most criminally vicious propaganda ever conceived by the mind of man is that which steeped in misrepresentation leads the common people into warfare upon each other while the selfish moneyed interests further their own designs of ensnaring pilfering robbing and finally murdering both factions of the people whomthey have phnged into the awful conflict the power trust by its unscrupulous methods can make an argument at least plausible on the surface in behalf of any of its schemes to further ensnare the great consuming public it can prove that a pig is a pig when it wants it to be a pig or a puppy when it suits their purpose for it to be a puppy tihe devil can quote scripture for his purpose the power interests want to build and own boulder dam and do not want the improvements made under the provisions of the swingjohnson bill in order to accomplish this purpose by means of false propaganda it is attempting to array the farmers of the south against the farmers of the west it is succeeding temporarily but the people will eventually know the truth and the truth will make them free it is the solemn sworn duty of members of congress to ascertain the truth about this matter and tell their folks of the fallacy of some of the alleged arguments that are going the rounds i repeat the power interests wish to plunge the farmers of the south into a bitter conflict with the people of the we t and reap a rich harvest as a result of the conflict this selfish interest which values the farmers of both the south and west only in terms of the money it can squeeze out of them is telling time people of the south that the people of the west are getting the advantage and the same group are telling the people of the west that the people of the south are about to overreach the west an attempt is being made to deceive both groups and make them bitter enemies of each other the people of the west are being warned that the zouth by the proper solution of the muscle shoals problem will be given an advantage to the detriment of the great western part of our country the good people of the south are told that by the construction of boulder dam the people of the west will gain a great advantage and the people of the south will suffer as a result i resent the efforts that are being made to mislead the people of the south and of the west the peoples of these two great sections have a common cause in their efforts to save the two great power properties at muscle shoals and boulder canyon to my mind the time is at hand for the people of the west to join hands with the people of the south in a common fight for the rights of both sections with this belief firmly established in my mind i have remained on the committee on irrigation and reclamation of the house not for the purpose of helping the west and only the west or the south and only the south but for the purpose of endeavoring to legislate for our whole nation i would not have remained on the committee had i not found myself in full accord with my colleagues in their efforts in behalf of the west i would not remain on this great committee as an obstructionist rather would i be a constructionist i realize that heretofore this committee has done much more for the west thanfor the south all the while though i have hoped for a new day in the reclamation program of this coun try there is much drainage and reclamation of waste lands awaiting governmental aid in the south and i firmly believe that a great reclamation program is under way for that great section of our country as a member of my committee i had the honor recently of reporting out the crisp reclamation bill this splendid bill by my colleague from oeorgia goes much further than has ever been gone before in the matter of reclamation for the south we have the support of governmental officials who have never before fought for such a program for the south i believe that we will pass the crisp reclamation bill in the near future and that it will prove to be the beginning of a program which will prove most beneficial to all the southland i am truly grateful to my colleagues on the committee and to other western members for the splendid support they have given congressman caise and myself in our fight for a reclamation program for the south i now know that my efforts in behalf of the good people of the west have not been in vain and i feel that they will continue to give to us their valuable support in our efforts for our people of the south i am happy to have been permitted to serve on this splendid committee with the good people of the west and other sections and i am truly glad to see the first dawn of a most excellent reclamation program of the south our cause is just and i confidently believe that this first dawn will brighten and that it will soon be daylight everwhere to my mind the muscle shoals and boulder canyon dam propositions are identical in many respects both if properly handled means cheaper electrical energy for all the people the power trusts are striving to grab both and use them to exploit the people rather than for their benefit the cry against the government in business is made as to both i do not believe in our giving away the peoples property in order to get the govenment out of business the government is already in business at muscle shoals what shall we do shall we give away the plant costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in order to get out of business shall we give away all governnent property in order to get the government out of business shall we give away the fabulously valuable oil properties public lands and timber properties of the government in order to get the government out of business shall we stop the united states mail system and deliver it to private interest in order that postal and parcelpost charges may be doubled several times in order to get the government out of business shall we give away all governmentowned ships to get the government out of business shall congress cancel all foreign debts in order to get the government out of business and to enable the international bankers to collect greater interest on safer loans shall we close down the ruralcredit system and put ai end to all government aid to road buprovements to get the government out of business in short shall congress tax the common people unto death to buy and improve great properties needed for governmental purposes and then give these properties to the big rich in order to get the government out of business shall we stop the regionalbanking system to get the governmeit out of business everyone will readily agree that the answer to these questions is no a thousand times no then there is but one answer to the demand that the government give away muscle shoals in order to get out of business or that we give to the power interests the great asset of boulder canyon and that is an emphatic no we as members of congress are engaged in the greatest business on earth that of governing the greatest people on earth the government can not get out of business and continue to be a government the government is in business on every hand by day and by night for other folks why not for the farmers and the consuming public in effect it is urged that it would be treasonous for the government to engage in any business that would in the least lessen the profits of either those who sell to the masses or who buy their products at a sacrifice but that it would be an act of the highest patriotism to perpetuate the government in the business of helping others make additional profits out of the common people it is the same old story of attempting to help others on the theory that part of their profits may eventually ooze through their pockets and in some mysterious way help the farmers and the ultimate consumers plenty of people are willing to help the farmers and consumers if they at the same time help other people more they are not willing to help the farmers and consumers if it interferes in the least with any other busihvss many many there are who want to get the government out of business and want to get themselves in business by grabbing our great national assets such as our oil properties timber and mining lands power sites improved and unimproved such as boulder dam and muscle shoals and in fact all properties of whatever nature the power trust and the national fertilizer association would be delighted to get the government out of business at muscle shoals by the government practically giving this great godgiven asset to the combined power and fertilizer interests these selfish interests either want muscle shoals and boulder canyon donated to them or operated for their special benefit they would much prefer that this great plant at muscle shoals paid for with the peop es money and erected on a site specially prepared by the great i am be closed down and rot to the ground rather than for it to be operated in behalf of the farmers and ultimate consumers of electrical energy i am opposed to the governments going into business as a general proposition i believe in private initiative the fullest protection should be given to any individual firm or corporation who initiates something worth while the individual who produces something good where nothing existed before is a bene factor and i for oie will go the limit in his behalf if the power trust ever prove to my satisfaction that they the power trust builded and created the rivers the canyons the mountains and the waterfalls and caused the clouds and the rainfall that makes the rivers flow with liquid power then i will vote for them to have the earth and fullness thereof but so long as i believe that god created these things for his children and so long as i represent my people i shall vote to render unto the great common people the things that are theirs and to the power interest the things that are theirs i do not believe in the governments going into the business of manufacturing knives or cloth or building houses neither would i advocate the government building factories and entering business in competition with other businesses where the people who huilded the factory in the first instance created a factory factory site and everything connected therewith if it was also necessary for the government to go into the market and build everything from the ground at muscle shoals the government already has a most expensive plant and the almighty gave us a most wonderful power site at boulder canypn we have a power site unequaled in the world the government is not building power sites at either of these locations god builded them for the people shall we give them to those who wish to exploit the people we have already used the peoples money at muscle shoals to improve that great asset shall we now donate that property to the power interest or shall we retain it for all the people the people of the great west say to us that they need so much the power and water that will be created and inpounded by boulder dam and the site is so valuable that if the government will in effect loan them the money to build that great dam they the people of that country will pay back within a reasonable time the loan principal and interest in full and be glad for the united states to still own the great property for the use of the whole people the power interest say no we are not willing for the government to build that great dam we will build it and make the people pay for it and we will still keep the great property and we will make the people pay for it again and again forever as we resell it every few years while we continue to own it objections have been urged to the governments constructing boulder dam it is contended that this would be putting the government in business and thus depriving the power interest of equal protection under the law the power trust claims to be asking for equal rights and not for special privilxix 29 leges there is only one canyon of the colorado and the syndicate or corporation that ever gets possession of that great asset will enjoy not only a special privilege but the only privilege of possessing the greatest power site with the greatest possibilities of all the earth there is no other similar site for anyone else the ownership of this great asset by any one group of persons will be most assuredly a special privilege equal rights to all in this instance can only be maintained by the ownership of all the power trust by virtue of the ownership of boulder dam would have not only the greatest power site on earth but also would have a strangle hold on the irrigation of the most fertile valley of all the earth and would hold the key to the floodgates of destruction and complete annihilation of the property and lives of all the people of imperial valley it would hold in the hollow of its hands the domestic supply of water and thus the very lives and existence of the people of los angeles and a large part of southern california and would be exercising the function of the president and the united statessenate in the handling of an international problem of tremendous importance in addition to all of these tremendous powers the power trust would have welded one more mighty link in the chain of power trust slavery by which it is seeking to bind allthe people of this great nation all let us retain muscle shoals and let us build boulder dam and preserve all our great national assets for allour people muscle shoals and boulder dam under government operation mean cheaper power to the ultimate consumer and cheaper and better fertilizer to the farmers shall we vote for the people or shall we vote for the greatest trust of all time our action in these matters will show where we stand the power interests do not desire government operation of these two properties for two reasons in the first place the power people want the great profits which they can squeeze out of the people by their operation of these two properties then again they know full well that government operation of these sites in the manufacture of fertilizer and electrical energy means much cheaper power and fertilizers not only for those who buy from these sites but for all the folks unfortunately arizona and utah are objecting to the construction of boulder dam they seem to fear they will lose some of their rights if the dam is built under the terms of the swingjohnson bill if the power trust gets this property it would not only rob the states of arizona and utah but would further ensnare all the people of this great republic the argument is made that the utilities commissions of the various states have ample power to control the great power interest unfortunately this is not true there are many reasons why the state commissions are almost helpless i can not argue this angle at this time it would require hours to tell the real truth about the transfer of state rights and the loss of the people incident thereto anyone familiar with the eschcummings railway act knows what i have in mind i fought that bill but the efforts of myself and others were of no effect we must begin to protect the people while we own these great assets if we lease we must secure ironclad contracts of unimpeachable terms or we will lose the great inheritance our people justly own no publicutility concern should be permitted to demand from the people a return on any value except for actual prudent investments we may not be able to achieve this great right as to properties already owned by power interests we certainly owe it to our people to protect them as to future transactions but in my limited time i can not further discuss this great problem of rates and so forth the boulder dam problem is one of the most interesting ever presented to the congress there is only one boulder canyon there is only one colorado river and only one grand canyon of the colorado the whole picture is most interesting and i wish i had for a few brief hours the gift to put in words what god hath wrought in 1is great masterpiecethe colorado from the mountains through the canyon to the sea oh that it was given to man this side of heaven to picture its beauty tell of its mission grasp its power and see as god sees its offerings to the ages all humanity can not fathom it for a single second of time neither can all wisdom tell the history of a single grain of its sands it extends from eternity to eternity as gods own i have stood for hours gazing into its mighty canyon 12 to 14 miles wide and a mile deep into which it seems that the great builder has grouped all the beauty of all the earth i am sure i shall never see any other scene in this life half so impressive except the starry heavens and that nothing beyond the grave will excell it but gods own glory and the splendor of life without end eternal and in the heavens i can never feel that this great handiwork should become the property right of the few rather than the birthright of all but the greater the cause of conflict the greater the battle those who desire this great asset for their own selfish interest are in the fight to the finish and care not for the wounded and dying just so they are driving toward their objective they are fighting to the finish and seeking to cause us to make war against each other the power trust by insidious deceptive propaganda is attempting to prod the people of the south of the west and of the whole nation into a mighty riotous conflict in the awful darkness of misguided prejudice where the common people will face certain ignominious defeat with friend defeating friend farmer destroying farmer and brother killing brother while the archconspirators of the fratricidal conflict grabs the two greatest assets of the american people the allwise father of us all gave to the american people these two great assetsthe great colorado and the wonderful tennessee rivers shall we as representatives of our great people donate these godgiven properties to the power interest to become an illpowerful force for the enslaving of the people whom god intended them to serve or shall they remain unto the people now and forever a covenant of deliverance let us protect property rights by retaining for all the people the property which god gave to all this is not a nation of property but of people as legislators let us battle for rights of property only as the agency by which and through which there is preserved and strengthened every godgiven right of the whole people"],

colonel pickens of south carolina overtook the tories under colonel boyd a british soldier killing him and many of his followers thus ending british dominion in georgia i submit the following information regarding the battle of kettle creek this narrative of facts is taken from different histories that have dealt with this revolutionary battle viz the georgia historical quarterly published by the georgia historical society volume 10 1926 otis ashemore and charles h olnstead being the authors of the articles on the kettle creek battle mccalls history of georgia history of south carolina 1858 by ramsey history of north carolina 1908 by ashemore story of georgia 1900 by jones messrs ashemore and olmstead in dealing with the battles of kettle creek and brier creek say many of the battles of the revolution fought on southern soil are involved in much obscurity and times effacing fingers are rapidly consigning to oblivion the remaining fragments of the past the south has been far too neglectful in recording and preserving its history the special story of the south during the revolution has been told by several wellknown historians in general they all agree on the important points about the battle of kettle creek colonel boyd was an irishman by birth but lived in south carolina ile was a bold notorious and dishonest tory who was bribed by sir henry clinton to raise an insurrection in the back country of south carolina as soon as the british captured savannah his followers were thieves robbers and murderers he tried to make a junction with the notorious mcgirth but was killed at the battle of kettle creek from all the reports that come to us from the revolutionary days we can well understand that the force which had gone raging through south carolina was worthy of the reputation borne by its leader boyd lossing in his field book of the revolution speaks of them asbandits and murderers wherever they went through the palmetto state they left a broad track of blood and pillage no mans life was safe from their murderous weapons be he soldier or simple farmer citizen the virtue of no woman could be guarded from their treacherous brutality no humble cottage escaped their flaming torches and now these bandits were coming across the savannah river into georgia to continue the nameless horrors begun in carolina wherever a southern soldier breathed there was a fixed resolution that boyds band must be wiped out and that speedily gen elijah clarke was born in north carolina and in 1744 he moved to wilkes county ga he took a prominent part in the skirmishes with the indians he commanded the left wing of the american forces at the battle of kettle creek and contributed largely to the great victory over the tories under boyd at that place he was at the sieges of savannah and augusta he was a brave and patriotic diamond in the rough with an interesting career he died january 15 1799 and was buried in lincoln county ga his will is on record at lincolnton in his history of georgia charles c jones jr gives the following description of the battle of kettle creek retiring from carrs fort the americans recrossed the savannah river near fort charlotte and advanced toward the long cane settlement to meet colonel boyd hearing of his advance capt robert anderson of colonel pickenss regiment summoning to his aid capts joseph picke william baskin and john miller with their companies crossed the savannah river with a view to annoying boyd when he should attempt tlhe passage of that streami he was subsequently joined by some georgians under capt james little retreating rapidly captain anderson formed a junction with colonels pickens and dooly and united in the pursuit of the enemy on the 12th of february passing the savannah river at the cedar shoal the americans advanced to the fisll dam ford ol broad river the command had now been reinforced by colonel clarke and 100 dragoons captain neal with a part of observation was detached to hang upon the enemlys rear and by frequent couriers keep the main body well advised of boyds muovements shaping his course to the westward and purposing a junction with mcgirth at a point agreed upon oil little river the enemy on the morning of the 13th crossed broad river near the fork at a place subsequently known as webbs ferry informed of this movement the americalls passed over broad liwver and encamped for the night on clarkes creek within 4 miles of the loyalists early on the morning of the 14th the americans advanced rapidly but cautiously wherever the surface of the country permitted their line of march was the order of battle a strong vanguard moved 150 paces in front the right and left wings consisting each of 100 men were commanded respectively by colonels dooly and clarke the center numbering 200 men was led by colonel pickens officers and men were eager for the fray and colfident of victory soon the ground was reached where the enemy had encamped during the preceding night seemingly unconscious of the approach of danger the loyalist commander had ialted at a farm on the north side of kettle creek and turned out his horses to forage among the reeds which lined the edge of the swamp his men who had been on short allowance for three days were slaughtering bullocks and parching corn colonel boyds second officer was lieutenant colonel moore of north carolina who is said to have been deficient both in courage and in military skill the third in command major spurgen was brave and competent as colonel pickens neared the enemy captain mccall was ordered to reconnoiter his position and unperceived to acquire the fullest possible information of the status of affairs having completed his observations that officer reported the encampment formed at the edge of the farm near the creek on an open piece of ground flanked on two sides by a cane swamp and that the enemy was apparently in utter ignorance of any hostile approach the americans then advanced to the attack as they neared the camp the pickets fired and retreated hastily forming his line in rear of hits encampment and availing himself of the shelter afforded by a fence and some fallen timber boyd prepared to repel the assault colonel pickens commanding tile american center obliqued a little to the right to take advantage of more commanding ground the right and left divisions were somewhat embarrassed in forcing their vway through the cane but soon came gallantly into posttion colonel boyd defendld the fence with great bravery but was finally overpowered and driven back upon the main body while retreating he fell mortally wounded pierced with three balls two passing through his body and the thhd through his thigh the conflict now became close warm and general some of the enemy sore pressed fled into the swamp and passed over the creek leaving their horses baggage and arms behind them after a contest lasting an hour the tories retreated through the swamp observing a rising ground on the other side of the creek and in rear of the enemys right on which he thought the loyalists would attempt to form colonel clarke ordering the left wing to follow irim prepared to cross the stream at this moment his horse was killed under lim mounting another lie followed a path which led to a ford and soon gained the side of the hill just in time to attack major spurgen who was endeavoring to form his command upon it he was then accompanied by not more than a fourth of his division there having been some mistake in extending the order the firing however soon attracted the attention of the rest of his men who rushed to his support colonels pickens and dooly also pressed through the swamp and the battle was renewed with much vigor on the other side of the creek bloody and obstinate was the conflict for some time the issue seemed doubtful at length the americanls obtained complete possession of the hill and the enemy routed at all points fled from the scene of action leaving 70 of their number dead upon the field and 75 wounded and captured on the part of the alnericans 9 were slain and 23 wounded to colonel clarke great praise is due for his foresight and activity in comprehending the checking at its earliest stage the movement of the loyalists beyond the swamp had they succeeded in effectillg a permanent lodgment upon the hill the fortunes of the day would have proved far otherwise this engagement lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes and during most of that time was hotly contested as the guard having charge of the prisoners captured when boyd crossed tire savannah river heard of the disaster which had overtaken the main body they voluntarily surrendered themselves 33 in number to those whom they held in captivity promising if allowed to return in peace to their homes to take the oath of allegiance to the government of the confederate states the battle ended colonel pickens waited upon colonel boyd and tendered him every relief in his power thanking hii for his civility the loyalist chief disabled by mortal wounds and yet brave of heart inquirei particularly with regard to the result of the engagement when told that the victory rested entirely with the americans he asserted that the issue would have been different had he not fallen during the conversation which ensued lie stated that hie had set out upon his narch with 800 men in crossing the savaiah river he sustained a loss of 100 in killed wounded and missing in the present action lie had 700 men under his command his expectation was that mcgirth with 500 men would form a junction with him on little river either that very afternoon or on the ensuing morning the point named for this union of forces was not imore than 6 miles distant fron tire place where this battle had been fought alluding to his own condition he reiarked that he had but a few hours to live and retiursted colonel lickens to detail two men to furnish him with water and to iiter his body

be able to have the funds necessary to purchase the helium that the hearings show they desire in the hearings general fechet said they would need 132 000 but that was based on helium at a price of 46 per thousand at the new plant at amarillo provided they can run reasonably near capacity they hope finally to be able to make the helium at 20 per thousand and i take it this is the basis on which the committee made the amount 50 000 as shown by the hearings not only on the department of commerce bill but on the present billand i have confirmed this by consultation with the bureau of minesthis is based on their being able to run at something near capacity on page 369 of the hearings on the department of commerce appropriation they give an estimate of 20 based upon a purchase of 8 100 000 cubic feet by the army and navy combined and they state that it would require an additional amount if less than this amount were purchased in this letter from mr turner who is the director of the bureau of mines having this work in charge it is stated costs as low as those indicated by the above table should not be expected during the first few months of operation as a new plant the plant has just about been completed and will be ready to go into operation some time during this month probably between the 15th and february 1 for the first few months even if they ran at full capacity they will not be able to furnish the helium at this price the cheapest helium that has ever been purchased by the government is 35 per thousand by my amendment i have not increased the appropriation to 132 000 which was based on the old rate they had to pay at the fort worth plant because of the scarcity of gas and their inability to run full time but i have placed it at 35 per thousand and i have put it not to exceed 81 820 which is figured on the amount of helium they require at 35 per thousand i think when we have spent 700 000 to build and equip a new plant and have the facilities already for operation it would be parsimonious it would be false economy not to give them a chance to get into proper operation not to give them a little leeway because even the director who is in charge says they will not be able the first few months to make the helium at 20 per thousand even operating at practically full capacity my amendment does not provide the full amount requested 132 000but only 81 000 which is an increase of 31 000 i think the committee should give them this opportunity this is a matter of tremendous importance why in this same bill we are appropriating 150 000 for the breeding of cavalry horses this may be important and i suspect it is they need cavalry horses at times but in war times dray horses are used much more than cavalry horses if it is important to appropriate for some of these items here it seems to me we could appropriate 31 000 more to an item as important as helium which is for a great wing of the army lighterthanair craft which to say the least has some indication of being of service it is a branch of the service that is cheaper to operate than the heavierthanair craft they have been able to make much longer flights than the heavierthanair craft way back in 1919 the old british r 34 crossed the ocean both ways we have recently gone to panama in about onefifth the time it would take ships to go there they also used captive balloons in war times even though filled with hydrogen lighterthanair ships have gone great distances filled with hydrogen they are much safer when filled with helium i think when we have gone to this expense in the equipment of a plant it would be the height of folly to cut this appropriation down and require the plant which cost 700 000 to stand in idleness and rust when by adding a few thousand dollars to the original

first time three menwe all remember the occasion a few months ago when three men made a western trip across the atlantic in an airplane the papers had headlines filled with it all over the country that was the first time anyone had ever crossed the atlantic in an airplane in a nonstop flight in a westerly direction yet four years beforemore than that in fact in 1919the r34 made a flight both across and back and four years ago the los angeles purchased by this country flew 5 000 miles from germany and landed over here and neither caused much more than a ripple of comment the los angeles had made more than a hundred successful flights one of the dirigibles in this country made a flight of 9 000 miles recently i think the los angeles went to panama in about onefifth the time it takes a steamer to go there all that is important not only from the commercial standpoint but from the standpoint of the military service from the military standpoint it is recognized as so important that germany and other countries are building these craft they are spending much more than we have talked about here today trying to develop a substitute for helium and they have been trying to locate helium also other countries have spent large sums in trying to find some source of supply of a commodity of which america has practically a monopoly they recognize its importance and i think the congress ought to recognize its importance i think it will in the course of time an effort is being made to develop helium by private concerns i hope it will be successful but in conservation matters private concerns can not always be depended upon the conservation of our natural resources is one of our principal needs and particularly the supply of helium because as we know at present it is somewhat limited and very much limited so far as locality is concerned in the matter of reforestation it is possible that private interests might reforest this country as cheaply or even more cheaply than the government but it is generally recognized that reforestation must be handled by the government that is true of the development of helium i am informed that a private concern is now making helium from a gas that can not be used for any other purpose that gas ought to be kept in the ground and the helium ought to be extracted from gas that we use for other purposes in various localities one in oklahomani do not know to what extentand in certain sections of texas and in one or two other sections there is a gas that contains helium that comes into use for fuel but the helium is taken out of the ground and if it is not extracted it is wasted i understand that one institution is extracting helium from a gas that is used for no other purpose than the extraction of helium"],
