bill the laboring masses of the country rightfully have conceived that the fruits of their industry are being controlled and tithed with unjust tribute to classes who have been favored in tise grant of special privileges by the legislation of the government it is proposed by the authors of the present bill to redress this grievance by the methods suggested in the bill what are the methods of relief proposed stated in brief they are that the president of the united states shall appoint a commission of nine persons whose duty it shall be to adopt and fix rates of transportation to be charged by all railroads engaged in interstate commerce and may from time to time change and revise any schedule of rates they may adopt these ofiecers are subject to removal lythe president and the only qualifieation required of them is that they shallbe residents of the differeni judicial circuits of the united states and be disinterested any charge of rates beyond those fixed by the commission is declared unlawful and punished by fine e unless the railroad company can affirmatively show that the charge is reasonable this commission is to be continued as a bureau of railroad statistics with a secretary all these are salaried officers an oamination of the bill shows that it is claimed by its authors that an agency or party distinct from the shipper and the carrier may intervene to regulate the terms of the contract of shipment between them it is alleged that tho right and asthority to do so is derived from the power expressly conferred upon congress ly section 8 article 1 of the constitution which is granted in these words to regulate commerce with feign natalons and among the several slates and with the indian tribes i adopt hero the words of the report of the majority of the committee when i say that in considering thd question whether snder this provision congress has power to pass the bill reported it will benecessary to inquire as to the nature and extent of the power conferred thereby upon congress in so dohag i do not care to examine the judieial decisions they have been ably dissected and canvassed by my learned friends from kentucky and from illinois it is sufficient to say that the precrse question has not been raised before or decided by the courts the sature and extelti of this power is then ass open question before the people and the courts looking to the history of the aloptioi of this grant of power and to the circumstances that made it necessary as well as tle prmtice and legislation of the government since its formation down to tire present time none of which is it pretotled shows that such an exercise of it as is claimed by this bill was ever attempted or submitted for action it would seem that we would be warranted in giving as the true constructioun and meani g of these words to reguilate commerce among the states the acoepted one heretofore tat is that it was intended to secure free commerce among the sttcs and that congress was invested alone with thepower to remove any obstruction or impediment thereto but it is said that the extnsion and multiplication of railroads and their uses in the cearying tralde and especially among the states has made the exercise of this power necessary and that the grant is express in its terms does the power to regulate mean the power to control to give life or death does the power to regulate moan that you may appropriate the service or property of tie citizen to the uses and interest of the public without direct compensation to him and by arbitrarily determining the value of his time the iso of his property and his labor without his consent do you ut appropriate it to the public again is the power to regulate commerce among the states any more comprelensive than the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations are not the same terms used in the same grant of power yet who will argue that we may create a commission to establish and then front time to time revise and alter the schedule of rates to be charged by domestic vessels engaged in foreign commerce or foreign vessels engaged in the like trade such a board would perform the office of a chines wall but sir turning for a momeut to the arguments made by the supporters of this bill and adopting the liberal and latitudirarian cosstruetion they have used it would seem that the nature and extent of this power is boundless and may embrace not only the common carriers isy nrl st the common carricr by the roadwagon by the transfurwagon by the omnibus by the coach by the dray by the truck by the 7pachorse and by the wheelbarrow it may extend to the vehicle or instrument and may include the warehouse and rhe depot and far beyond that the barn the crib and the field one cannot contemplate these assumptions of power in the general government without serious apprehensions as to the fato of all our local jurisdiction and the freedomn of individual action and the mere confrontment of the results you must reach upon the exercise of such power must show that such nature and extent thereof was never eontemplated by the founders of eta government and while it must be admitted that the railroads of this country have been favored by partial legislation that they enjoy vast privileges ind that in the exercise of them many unjust discriminations partialities andeonabiuations onerousexacting and extortionate upon the trade and commerce of the country are made that instead or serving the sovereignties that created them they are lording it over them and that instead of using the privileges conferred upon them for tise public good they in the interest of classes and sections are making war upon it whereby millions of tribute are unjustly taken from the producers yet heeding the reply of these railroads and putting the matter in a point of view where their defense is justly weighed and let it be granted that the cost of construction the cost of maintenance the cost of service has been and is such that it is not possible in justice to them to make any material reuction in the transportation of the products of the country what is the remedy will a commission fix less ratio will congress will tse president if the railroad companics are right and rates are fixed less if the power of selfprotection is taken away front them is not the whole system threatened could the country afford to abandon the railroads think for a moment of the number of miles of railroads the vast extent of territory and the number of people dependent upon their facilities how they are interlaced and interwoven with all eth industries of your cities towns villages and farms and then suppose them blotted out of existence or reflect again and ask whether the labor of forty millions of people represented from the largest manufacturing establishment in your mammoth cities to the smallest workshop in some remote village from the wheatfield of the north and the cornfield of the west to the rica sugar and eotton plantations of the south shosldbe made dependent not upos the health of vigorous competition not upon the thrift of energy not upon the life of activity not upon the fsesdon of thought and action of the individuals most interested nor yet upon the judgment and observations of local legislatures and corts but upon the knowledge jndgmeut passion prejudice and it may he interests of nine men who are not an ointed by god for the work but selected by one who is human like unte themselves does not the surrender of this control of all that may alspertarcn or be construed to appertain to the commerce between the states acau the abandonment of the great principles upon which republican government is based the capacity of the people for seifgovenment our national life the prosperity of the statesd the wealth comfort and support of the citizens are dependent upon commerce 8hall all these high interests be placed in the hando of one man who by the selection of the instruments of his will may have autocratic control and so may pervert them to their destruction great and serious are the evils which now by vast and powerful railroad combinatioss obstruct the freedom of commerce between the states but sir can any evil be so serious and so great as to demand the surrender of the popular liberties so serious and so great as to require that you shall depart from the faith upon which your government was based is it not better to bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of shall we escape frma one monopoly to become the victims of another what security have the people that after the adoption of this bill and the powers asserted under it those who will exercise the trust thus delegated to them are not or will not be in alliance with the monopolies and the rings against whom they now so vigorously protest what security have the people that the party which built up those gigantic monopolies by largesses in money and by empires of land who have robbed the landless of their inheritance to enrich corporations will not continue in the work of despolition is it not a high abuse of our trusts to relegate the powers placed in our hands by the people to others and these in no way responsible to hem can we legally and constitutionally delegate our authority it is alone given to us with no right of substitution turning for a moment to the actual condition of the country we are struck with the growth of corporations in this century especially in this country have their number and progress been rapid and include within their grasp almost every living industry and interest that they have accomplished much good i will not gainsay it is equally true that much of evil of fraud of wrong and oppression has followed in their train and their tendency is fruitful of more and in their effert to secure power over the industry the trade and the errrencyof the country threaten it with an iliad of woes hoar can individual labor and enterprise personal effert and industry ie expected to thrive and prosper when associated capital and labor is protected from the hazards of responsibility by corporate charters privileges and exemptions denied to individual capital and labor are granted and secured to corporate capital and labor the race is unequal it was against such monpolies and privileges that the origin and forms of ourgoverunments were a protest by american constitutions the largest liberty to the individual consistent with the rights of others was intended to be secured no privileged class no monopolies no perpotuitics but the coequal sovereignty of the citizen are the underlying principles of american liberty monopoly iu land was stricken lown shall it be said that monopoly in personal propcity and privileges is to be perpetuated nuder the sanction of oar laws it is a libel upon the spirit and theory of our institutions to so claim sir i am not prepared to concede that in a representative form of government whose legislative bodies are but the agents of the people the granting of franchises and privileges is a contract but conceding such an act is i submit that it is a sound lrinciple in law and in morals that an agent cannot exceed his authority and that be whocontracts with a known agent must take notice of the extent of his authority the agency or trust of the legislator is one to be exercised alone for the interest and welfare of the public no right or power is granted to any representative under our american constitutions to create monopolies to confer privileges and immunities over above beyond or inconsistent with the public good and the public welfare none whatever 6ir when we turn yet again to the condition of the country ad behold the gigantic strides it has made in increase of population in the multiplication of manufactures in the tremendous increase of agricultural productions and that the annual value of these productions a griultural i meanl are estimated at over three billion dollars and realizing the necessity of cheap transportation as well in the sale as iu the purclase of the conveniences and necessaries of life involved in the exchange of this immense amount of values and the supply of this large population and knowing as we do the magnitude of the exactions levied by the carriers upon this work of exchange especially by those carrier~s awho are shielded in their exactions by corporate charters we must rwcognize that the question under consideration is one of the deepest importance and gravest in consequences not only to parties but to the very life of the nation itself by the political faith of my life by the humble record i have made as a public servant as well as by my sense of the justice and truth of the complaints made by the people i am cordially in sympathy with their earnest protest against the exactions the extortions and encroachments of the monster corporations of the country but the bill under consideration fails to give relief is fraught with more inngoi than oxisting evils and is liable to the grave suspicion that it nay be prostituted by the very agemts it professedly seeks fo control another remedy has been soggested and that is that the government shall build by its moey and credit various railroads and canals the estimated cost of the most prominent being 300 000 000 the real cost of which judging by the experience of our national and state governments in similar public enterprises it is entirely safe to estimate will be nearer a billion dollars launch the goverment into the experiment of building those already suggested and there will come an irresistible demand floi every section of the country to build other roads and other canals awhich you are compelled to lhced or else gross itjuslice will be done and the end no man can foretell build them to any extent and you place the covernment in competition with its citizens and you confer the appointment of a horde of agents and employds tpon the commander of your army and navy and whose army of civilofficers now aggregates in numbers by the thousand can tii s state of things exist in harmony with the character of your government as founded by its fathers sir it seems that the mere statement of the probable cost o such improvements the cost of sustaiiitg lhem in repair and in the employment of agents to operate them with the knowledge by the people of the inevitable and inseparable corruption and extravagance that seem naturally to attach to all associations of government with public works together with the too certain increase of taxation is sufficient to condemn these propositions akin to these is yet another suggested remedy iow but remotely hinted at but yet the one most to be apprehended that is thaat the oorennmeft shall take hold amd use the roads abeady ill eistsnce in alt this struggle the real contest is one bet ell capital and labor under our institutions feudal rigtts have been abolished estates are not held for centuries lords princes dukel aid barons are not born re inheritances saved to them without labor the theory of our institutions is supposed to be in conformity to she injicnetion of god that by the sweat of your face you shall cam your bread unhappily there is with all of us an effort to avoid this injunction and no better method of avoiding it has been discovered in this country than bythe investmei of capital in bods the bondholder neither toils nor labors and it is to the perpetuity of debt that he looks for perpetuity in estate and whatever may tend to increase the debt or prolong its existence finds in him all advocate the railroad debt of the united states as stated by the railway monitor amounts to 3 72 416 000over three billion dollars now if this amount could be added to the present indebtedness of the united states the idea of its payment would be hopeless and the bondholder and the bondholders wealth taxation would become permanent institutions i have feared that the just comlaints of the people egaist the exactions and extortions of the railroads would be added to by these persons with a view of cltimately directing tha attention of the laboring and producing masses to the purchase of the rtilroad as the esily solution of the transportation problem in the hope that when maddened by the tyracmy and oppression of these corporations a majority of the people without due reflection as to all the consequences would accept the proposition is there any ground for this apprebensios i have not seen andexanined the report of the railroad commission appointed by the english parliament in which this matter is discussed but learn from those who have that they report that in england tie only solution to this vexed questioi is either free conipetition or the purchase by the government of the railroads the railroad commissioners of massachusetts have advised substantially the purchse of leading railroads in that state and recently in the transportation conventiontat assembled in this city this idea was udvanced by a leading member and a piominent statesmanin the country lolcingto the vast interest represented by the capital and bondholders of these railroads looling to the motives that control men and paying due regard to the tendencies of the times find time ditlieulties ts at inhere to the 4lestion may it nor be apprehended there is danger that if we enter upon this commissioi its mission may end lit the same coaclusion thctt the government must own the railroads in order to furnish cheat transportation to the people i united by every feeling of my nature and by a political faith derived front the teachings of ir jefferson to the agricultrl interests of the country and believing that they are the truest and most nselfish guardiians of popular liberty ani democratic institutions and recognizing their complaints to be just i as a friend entreat them to watch closely the effortsbeing made to take control of their wealth acid their labor by eicer cif the modes suggested popular liberty is lost when the citizen becomes a creature of the government freedon in the person is not consistent with dependence upon or the guardianship of the ruler siuee then expedients will not do the question recurs in face of admitted abuses and evils are there no constitutional and appropriate remedies in my opinion there are and first in this admitted power of congress to regulate commerce not by interfering with the right of the citizen to contract as be may please but in punishing by appropriate fines and penalties all comisination tin ito regi htins ocdinnmces or rates which interfere with or obstinet the freedom of commeurce whether adopted by states corporations ox individuals secondly by the improvement of such rivers and lakes as are national in tflor character thirdly by the direct i tcrference and control of the states ever such charters as are being abused to the prejudice of the public welfare in other words the exercise of the locil sovereignty frot whom their powers are derived but beyond and superior to all these is the fourth remedy and that is that the taxes which reet upon thi labor and productions of the country shall be diminished whtat are these nominally they are fornational state and municipal purposes about 700 000 000 really they are about i 000 000 000 it is estimated by gentlemen who have given close attention to the principles and working of i protective tari1 that the eonsucmers under our existing laws pay nearly as nich into the

the first half of the year but i do not understand the supplies are farnished and paid for until the necessities of the agencies require them that is my answer to the question of the gentleman now then the entire cost of the indian service for the first six monthsof the present fiscal year was 4 386 529 92 as i have already stated supposing it will cost as much for the remaining six months as for the preceding six months we have as the total cost of the in dian bureau for the entire year the modest little sum of 8 733 559 84 estimating the cost of the present year therefore at the sum of 8

presidents johnson and lincoln imuediatoly preceding shat of president grant and that it has cost 16 901 946 84 more than was expended for the same purpose in an equal number of years under the administrations of presidents buchanan and piesce which immediately preceded the war the gentleman from iowa in his remarks a day or two since undertook to give an explanation of the causes which render necessary an increase in the expgditures of the itlian department now over what they were in former years and attributed it to the fact that in bygone days the indians had a wide extent of country abundantly supplied with game over which to roam ad hunt t will and had access to streams abounding with fish of every variety and description whereas now he says they are crowded upon small sterile and unproductive reservations upon which it is impossible for them to live by the hant and the chase and which are utterly uissited for agricultural purposes on the ether hid however the gentleman from missouri in his remarks undertook to show us that the reservations upon which the indians are now located are eutirely too large for aiiy pr actical purpose aund embracetoo much of thovaluablc publiedoniiii not required for the rel wants and ueeessities of the lidiaas ai to prove this he exhibited to the house a table of statistics and figures vhich demonstrates the fact that there are at present within the various indian reservations upon an average at least sevea hundred acres of land to every indian located thereon now there say possibly be something in the suggestion of the gentleman from iowa that the supply of grjme from which the indians were at one time able to subsist themselves is not so abundant now as it was in former times and however just and pertinent his remarles may have been in reference to the condition of the indians at the present day as compared with that of the indians of twentyfive or thirty years ago they have no sort of applicability to the condition of rte indians for the last five years past and furnish no explanation whatever for the increased1 expenditures of the indian service under president grants admiuistration for the sinplc reason that the reservations upon which tie indians are now placed hive not been materially dimittished in size from what they were five years ago arc certainly no more sterile and unproductive now than then aid the indians quite as capable of subsisting theirisnives now as they hanve been for years past we must therefore search elsewhere and look to other causes than those assigned by the gentleman from iowa for an explaration of the startling increase in the expenditures of the indian bureau for the five years last past ba this socalled peace policy has net only shown itself toi be

the currency 450 000 000 or 500 000 000 but the senate would not igree to it and the bill failed they would tell you what you know to be true that you knew at the time yon voted for these ainedmonts that their passage would defeat the bill and uon did not dare to adhere teadily to the only measure of relief you knew coul be carried because you were afraid your constituents had not sense enough to understand the true mecaing of your act there is not a mnn on this floor who believes that atix bill expanding the igaltender ctrrency beyond 400 000 000 wuonld recive any consideration in the senate sicrely that fact would be a goodreason to assign to any constituency for refusing to support amncudments proposingto inflateit beyond that amount i confess that i ammsnoro afraid of the fears which the friends of this measure have of the intelligence of their own constituents thm i am of the power of the contractiouists and therefore i have made these remarks as i assure the house in no unkind spirit but because i earinestly desire to accomplish something practical all sorts of attacks have been and will be made against the mcasue some are directed against the expedieney others against the constitutionality of it as to the the latter i have only time to say now that right or wrong the supreme court has settled that atd have said in he legaltender cases in 12 wallace page 542 congress is the only proper body to pass upon this question i quote only this brief extract congress had the choice of ineans for a legitimate end each appropciate ail adapted to that end thou perhaps in difereat

necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribes the jodieial department and to tiend on legislative ground 0 e making the notes legal tender gave them a now use and it needs as argumeft to show that the value or things is in proportion to the uses to which they may ie applied i have seen all sorts of schemes introduced to defeat this measure one was presented by a gentleman from new york the other day the substance of which was to declare the issue of greenbacks over 356 000 000 illegal bat to provide at the same time thathe national banks should take them in that they should he redeemable at the pleasure of the government or at the pleasure of the holders they may be convered into united states bonds imown as 5 per cents that is a nice propositionto convert these notes into 5 per cent bonds principal and interest payable in gold free from all state and federal taxationworth 10 per cent more than the ordinary legaltenders of the couetry the national banks are to gather up the notes issued in excess of 350 000 000 and then convert them into s per ceat gold bonds worth a premium of 10 per cent the holder thus receiving upon an illegal note 10 per cent more than the man can get who holds a legal one these notes of course would be absorbedby the national banks that may do for a bondholder but it will not do for the farmers of the west i saw a petition presented here the other day in which a statement was made that the petitioners represented 370 000 000 of capital si the uei of the region where 1 live represent 370 000 000 acres of land contraction of your currency will diminish its value and the value of all its products from 10 to 20 per cent and in their name i paotest against any contraction now i read a very remarkable speech the other day i will not say where it was delivered but i have here an extract from it i have had it written out to avoid an objection from anybody that the speech was delivered in the senate of the united states or made by an exsecretary of the treasury you can guess whether it was or not the extract is as follows and now that i have touched tupon the morat aspect of this qunestian perhaps i had better not depart from it list i tnay never return to it there is in all these propositions a morel questiobu whlit we are bound to consider if by forced contraction by legislative power directly applied yo contract thevolumea of currency in this couintry below 05 000 000 you livo required the debtor to pay something more to the creditor when it pays lils debt than lie wend have paid if yea had left the volume of

the piurpose the reohttion the act of congress to furnish the means by taxatlion for carrying en the government every scheme which adds to the volne of eurreacy has in it the element of immorality and the qualityof injustice think of the injustice of crippling the creditor class there is no such moral delinquency in injuring the debtor class of the coumntry the great mass of the agriculttists says the distinguished exsecretary are the debtor clas there are some who owe nothilg theoy are the creditor class legislate for them it is a moral wiroig if yot do othewiso that was the spirit and meaning of your most unjust and iniquitous law of 1869 to otreongthenwlat was called the public credit which the then secretary carried out with great promptnessm and by which bonds which were payable according to their face in greenbacks were paid in gold thus taking 40 0 000 omt of the treasury of the united states to be put into the pockets of the bondholders in plain violation of law it is the representatives of those same bondlolder who are now clamoring against any expansion of the currency of the country in order that they may pocket what yet remains in the hands of the poor and disorganized masses i have no sympathy with and no toleration for such legislation the gaeatest good to the greatest number the protection of the weak the humble and the unprotected ought to be the end and aim of all true men sir my own state of kentcky fiarnishes as good an illustration as any other of the necessity of kieeling the currency up to at least 400 000 000 and of having a fair distribution of the banking capital according to law if the bankiig system emnst be kept up if gentlemen will turn to the last report of the commissioner of internal revenue page 145 they will oo that for the eight years from 1866 to 1073 inclusive kentucky 1 ad into the treasury of tha united states as internal taxes upon her intustry 50 72 801 50 or an average of 6 341 525 20 a year if they will turn to the last report of the comptroller of the currecy page 7 they will find that while we in kentucky with a population about equal to massachusetts are allowed only 7 637 900 of currency massachusetts is flunished with 59 523 671 while we owing to our distance flom it scaboard need twice as much as massachusetts does we paid into the treasury last year 1 695 623 52 for taxation more than massachusetts while she has el 75 771 more banking capital than we are allowed by turning to page 11 of the consptrollers report it will be seen that in 1862 onr bank circulation was 9 035 794 or 7 82 per eaaita it is now in 1873 reduced down to 7 637 000 or 5 78 per cagile then over three hundred and twentyivothousand of our population wore slaves who used no capital now all are free and l1 need it it cannot be said of my state whatever naybe said of others that we do iot need it or are too poor to take it our last anditol s report shows that our product of tobacco flone was 158 184 92 pounds worth over 12 500 000 of which at least 130 000 000 pounds were expred or hemp products in bagging and rope were worth at least 5 000 000 while oir hog horse mule cattle mid other livestock crops which supply many of the southern states are simply enormous to say nothing of our cereals or manufactures it is no oxaggeration to say that my own congressional district which is perhaps the finest agricultural region in the world has more capaeity for production of all tht is aecessary to support human life or promote human comfort than the whole state of massachusetts ind i do not mean to disparage that great state or her people but i mean to assert that a grievous wrong has been done to my state by the uncqual and unjust discrimination which has been had and maintained to the prejudice of the people i have the honor in part to represent we cannot afford to contract the currency in the present condition of things we want reasonable expansion we need it we wtant equal distribution of the currency we are by law entitled to it it nity lie instrnctive to look at the history of the currency of the country tor the last eight years and see what it shows without kcnowledge upon that stbject and of our vants now as compared with former years we will be groping in the dark for that purpose official facts and figures furnish the best illustration i have noon

figures without feeling that it would be doing injustice to alt the interests of the country to refuse to legalize the 44 000 000 and make the legaltender currency at least 400 000 000 contraction below that point is equivalent to adding from 10 to 20 per cent to every debt which the debtor class of the country owe to their creditors sir if 1 000 000 000 of paper money wore in circulation in one form or other in 1868 andit has been redueed anywhere in the neighborhood of 300 000 000 since that time while the population has increased so vastly and when all the business of the country and its prosperity as well have increased 45 per cent how can men who engaged in business or contracted debts when that amount of currency regulated values either discharge their obligations or realize anything from their legitimate investments if the legalfonder notes of the country are to be still further reduced i in the 52 years from 1867 to theomiddlo sf 1873 31 041 miles efrailroad were

cry which has become so loud and incessant of late among the bondholders and their advoctes hero and elsewhere of the evils of an irredeemable paper currency or of their denunciation of what they choose to call tic worthles8 grcctbaeke a currency which oven at 400 000 000 can all be absorbed in two years if the friends of the bondholders and the other protected monopolists would only unite with those of us who believe in them in phssing a law authorizing the government to receive its own notes in payment of the customs duties it exacts from the people they need neither be worthless nor irredeemable the amount collected in gold from the people for tariff taxes alone in the last two years was 404 000 000 the people would gladly have paid it in legaltider notes and saved the 15 per cent premium which went into the pockets of the bondholders and those protected by the tariff these gentlemen with all their pretenses do not want the legaltenders redeemed they want the government to continue to repudiate them so long as they continue to pursue that policy it does not lie in their mouths to be crying out against the currency as being irredeemable sir all the legaltenders we ask to keep in circulation would not pay to the government the average annual taxes imposed upon the pieipo from 1867 to 1873 a leriod of six years the tacpayers of this coun1try paid into the treaisury as the last finance report shows 768 82 844 43twothirds of i in goldan average of 461 4d0 474 07 a year being 61 480 474 07 annually more than the 400 000 000 we ask you to legalize and yet it is called worthless and irredeemable the government can absorb it all in less than a year whenever a better substitute can be furnished all those who arc raising this false clamor about irredeemable currency know these facts full well sir without paper money none of the great results achieved could have been accomplished t he enorious taxation we have sustained could not have been borne our railroads could not have been built nor the waste places of the war restored all this has been done too under a nefarious banking system which has enriched a few monopolists at the expense of the masses twenty million dollars a year is thus lavished on pets and favorites i would abolish it at once iwouild make banking free and iwonld give the government the benefit of its own credit instead of enriching private individuals by it at the expense of the public but my tin is too nearly exhausted to take up that subject now i seal have but seven or eight minutes left one word upon another subject these results appear the more marvelous when it is remembered that they have ben accomplished in spite of the most nefarious systom of tariff taxation over invented by human ingenuityta system to which the american people never would hire submitted bat for the fact that it wasfastoned upon them diring the years of war when laws were silent when protests against oppressions were unheeded and when the men who had seized the reins of government were secretly under the guise of patriotism building up colossal fortunes for themselves by legislation which they knew was destructive of all the best interests of the republic these laws they still perpetuate in spite of all the efforts of the representatives of a disorganized people combined wealth and its represntatives in congross in the form of tariff protectionists bondholders national bankers and other corporate monopolies rule and control us in all things i wish some power existed to develop the number of representatives and senators who are personally interested in class legislation it would be an interesting exhibit and one which i think the country ought to have i have no doubt a majority in the senate and a large minority in the house arc personally interested in the passage of laws inimical to the interests of the masses but i have no time to go into that now and no time to develop the iniquitous workings of the tariff as a whole i must illustrate by an isolated proposition which will make the other kindred branches and their operations and effects easily comprehended take our shipping interest under the present tariff and compare it with what it was under the democratic revenue tariff of 1860 that is a fair example not governed or controlled by local influences and is an interest whose prosperity or decline reaches to the veiy vitals of the prosperity of the country up to 1860 we had been pushing to the front of the commercial nations of the world under the influence of a low revemue tariff with a steadiness and rapidity that were the just pride and boast of every american our sails whitened every sea our flog floated triumphantly in every foreign pert in a few years we had built up a commercial marine almost equal to that of great britain and surpassed that of all the other nations of the earth combined we were developing a class of sailors before whose skill prowess and energy even the tars of england quailed all nations were paying us tribute and while doing so they saw that we were only in oe infancy with empires even then untouched in the great west whose products would in the early future make our present greatness sink into insignificance and they felt that they were pygmies in a contest with a giant the broom of old van tromp was in our grasp we had aimost snatched englands national anthem from her our sailors could sing from their mastheadscolmbia needs no bulwarks no towers along the stoop oer marsh is oer the mountain wove her home o so dthe eep when in an evil hour we reversed iarn action piled burdons mount alithigh oni all that made or maintained ships and coimmere and by the folly the individual greed the imbecility to use no harsher term of the republican leaders and rulers we fell from our high estate and are tow smpplianfs and beggars where twelve years ago we were lordis and toasters a few manufacturers in new england and pennsylvania have been enriched a suffering and a plundered country has been hrouight to the verge of bankruptcy to enriehithem i propose to make good by official facts and figures all and far more thanal l that i hiave said in 1860 or total trade with foreign nations amounted in value to 71 9 288 550 of which american earned 507 247 757 and foreign vessels carried m55 047 793 the excess of freight in favor of the united states was then 252 206 964 and the excess of receipts or profits in the trade was 20 176 557 in his last annual message to congress on the 1st day of december 1873 the president of the united states said we pay 80 0 000 per annum for the transportation of our surplus products to a auket the increasing the balance of trade against us to that atnount think of it over 20 000 000 paid to us in 1860 for the same service for which we now pay foreign nations 80 000 000 a yeara difference of 100 000 000 against usa sum sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government during the twenty years of the administrations of george washington john adams and thomas jefferson this vast sum is not only gone from our own people forever but it is permanently transferred to the pockets of our antagonists in the contest for commercial supremacyto our enemies when strife arises it requires no spirit of prophecy to foretell the result of such a state of things official figures tell the melancholy tale they were all atrayed in a masterly manner by senater cetagin chairman of the committee on naval affairs at the last session of the last congress and being thus doubly official their correctness is undoubted he showed that up to 1850 we had accumulated a tonnage of 3 772 439 tons in 1830 we had increased our shipping 5 539 813 tons or nearly 47 per cent in ten years of low tariff and democratic rule we had built for foreign nations during that time 349 915 tons for which our builders and mechanics lid been paid 20 094 940 by them during that ten years of commercial prosperity our mechanical industries engaged in shipbuilding had realized 212 162 885 or 21 212 6 8 a year great britain had in 186061 a tonnage of 5 895 369 or only 355 556 tons more than we had though shehad been contending for supremacy on the sea for hundreds of years we her recently emancipated colonies were sweeping past her with a giants stride at that time the tonnage of all the other nations of the earth combined was less than ours i know the response which rises in the mind of every supporter of the administration and its protectivetariff policy is thattho uar drove our commerce from the soc destroyed ourships crippled our shipbuilders in short is reponsible for all that has followed i say with emphasis that is sot true except to a very limited extent as i will proceed to prove senator cr gin says our former average of 71 per rent in the total of both direct and adircct carrying tradc of 1860 is now redluced to 15 1cr con to what is thia ruinomo decline in the carrying trado upon the ocoanwhiel in 18061 was the nost presperous in the worhs hustanyto ho charged i is it the result of the four yearswar fiom 186t to 1865 let s see when the first battle of that war was fought in 1861in the month of july the registered andi enzolled tonago of the united states was 5 539 813 in july 1865 wholi the war was eided the rgistmred and onrolled tonnage was 5 093 781 showiug a decrease of only 443 032 sir in the face of these facts i deny that the war had anything appreciable to do with the present prostrate condition of our commmco all our reports all our statisticians agree that by the war the country lost 9 c00 000 000 of property and values hon david a wells in his iuvanablo reports which you have all doubtless read proves thali to be true beyond all peradventure yet in the midst of that terrible wreck we had only lost 442 000 of our tonnage we had still over 5 000 00 of tonnage afloat and ready for service in july 1865 what other industry lost so little when in 1865 a prostrate and warstricken country reunited and sprang upon irs feet when swords were turnedinto plowshares and spears into pruninghooks and all the great energies of a mightypeoplo were devoted to the building up of their waste places and the restoration of their desolated homes ships with a tonnage of over five millions ity ready iu the ports of the country to bear the products of the labor of the people to alt parts of the earth and to bring back in exchange the icessaries and the luxuries which soil climate and the habits or necessities of other regions hnabled them to produce for its more cheaply than we could when the country demanded the services of our ships and our sailors it was found that they were driven from the seas by our infernal system of tariff taxation our ships had to be sold for what they would bring and our bailors had to go into the coal mines or the iron founderies whose owners were enabled to employ them hy the bounties coereedout of the consumers of the country

these abuses sticking out at the knees and elbows what i have to say upon this occasion shall be in arraignment of a system not of an individumal and if what i may say of the congressional printer shall seem to be of a personal character it is so because the system of legislation under which he acts makes it necessary learning that such abuses did exist early in the session i introduced a resolution on the subject and hind it referred to the committee on printing of which the gentleman from iowa is chairman before this committee the congressimoal printer mr chipp was requested to appear this he declined to do i the grounds as i have been informed that he was an officer of the senate and was responsible to that body alone owing to this refusal to appear and testify before the hisse committee on printing my resohutioi failed and the comumittee reported a joint resolutio and have i pursuance of that resolmtion taken some testimoy and have just made report to this house i have refrained from speaking upon this subject until that report was made the day of adjourment tot being far off i feel it to be my duty to call the attenflee of the heuse to the subject now so that it can should it see fit correct existing abuses by proper and necessary legislation the refusal of mr clapp to appear before the house committee on printing i vill remark in passing has had one good effect namely it has opened theeyes of congress to the absurdity of making the congressional printer an officer of the senate and i hope that the amendtnent of my friend flot new yoxk which was put in the legislative executive anmd judicial appropriation bill by an abost unanimous veto of the iouse will lie adhered to 1my it this house is powerless to protect itself against this abuse if the senate committee is to control this whole subject for it is clear that the chairman of tleat committee in the senate either cannot or will not sea anything wrong in the present public priter or it the system under which he is actiig abuses in public priiting so far as the experieco of our miatioal government goes seem co be insepanble from the very subject this too is the experience of every state in the union so outrageos had these abuses become in my own state that the public printing there is regulated by a iwiso provision in our new constitutio it is a system of grossfavoritistm universally ahused not only in tile purchase of paper amd other material but in the printing and binting no one whet has paid the least atteution to the subject will say that the government can do its printing as cheap as individuals can do it indeed this is true of almost every enterprise iii the mani lgment of a government establishment under a superintendent working for a fixed salary you have the absence of that keen interest that watchfulnes8 aitd care which characterize the individual whose whole fortune is eubarked perhaps in the undertaking the individual will take care to buy his material where he can buy the cheapest see that the weight is full and strong that his employds make full tim and that waste and extravagance are avoided no congressman can cmepel him to employ some deadboat of a jour whom no weltmnasged establishment would receive for a moment or some politician who must be provided for whether there is work for him to do or not the history of our present printing office is the repeated experience of all the tther bureaus of the government numly that of rapid growth and it is only by constant watching and perpetual resistalico that this office has not outgrown all the ideas of its founders every year we witness a contest over the bureaus of education and agricuture they seem determined to expand beyond what was ever contemplated and congress has all it can do to resist these expansions this establishment small and humble at first has grown to he the largest in the country a building 675 feet longlarger by 73 feet than this capitolfour stories high flledwith the best presses in the world emploving over 1 500 persons purchasing 32j tons of types last year 174 of which were purchased for the congressional record alone and requiring an appropriation larger that the entire annnal civil expenses of the government during jacksons administration and this amount is constantly on the increase and what is a remarkable fact the congressional printer is constantly soliciting more printing from congress although he is an officer with a fixed animal salary not in any way depending upon the amount of printing done yet mr clapp goes about these halls hike some oliver twist asking for more this wears all ugly look ill conectlion with the fac stated in the newspapers in this city that mr clapp has a son in a baltimore house where most of the paper used iu public printing is purchased mr clapp may be innocent but ie suljects himself to a fearful suspicion but two or three years ago an investigation into one of our leading religious book concerns in new york city developed a similar aelation between one of the officers of that concern and the firns furnishing the paper in eonnection with this subject of public printing we must not forget tlae exact bearing which tile abolition of the franking privilege has upon it i voted for its abolition and against every attempt to restore it directly or indirectly except so far as country newspapers are concerned i also bilieve that it will never be restored and thttt the saving to the taxpayers was not so much by what it may increase the revenues of the postoffice department is by what it diminishes the amount of public printing that tile abolition of the franking privilege will greatly decrease the public printing all must admit since its complete abolition ia march 1873 not one public document for general distribution has been ordered to be printed the reason is obvious the postage on these books would be nearly as great as the pity of a member besides threefourths of these doeninents are not worth the postage no constituent would pay it to have one it is notorious that bit once in a great while there is one worth printing take the abridged messages and documents oumere and navigation reports the reports of the heads of the various departnlits t e report of the columissioner of education and with the exception of tle last no constituent would thank a member if he sent one of theiutolim postage prepaid because he may wade through volume after volume in the hope that he may find some new thought some idea worthy to be treasured up but when he gets through he will fild his search in vain the messages and documents at best possess but au ephemeral interest tltose whofeel enongilinterest in them to read them will do s as they appear in the newspapers at the tie cof their communicationt to congress but who a yearaftertheir transmission to congress willtake the pailisto go through this mountain of chaff in order that he may perhaps find a grain of wheat not one it ten thousand yet as long as these books passed through the mails free congressmen would frank them to their constituents for it was about the easiest way to get rid of them there are not ten members on this floor today who would vote to priit aity of these books simply because they know they are not worth oneialf the price of thie postage nor the tenth part of the cost of paper printing and binding jist how much the public printing will be diminished it is hard now tc say but it certainly will reach 50 per cent tials being so no more favorable opportunity will le presented for disposing of this elephant which we now find on on hands it is a grave economical question involving miilions of dlo1 lars whether we will modify existing legislation or whether we will chatge the method of doing the public piting and award it to the lowest responsiile bidder the latter method in my mind is the cot rect one and every taxpayer in the country has a vital interest in tie change especially as it is becominig apparent that we must in erea e taxation to carry on the expenses of te governnleiti if th congress adjourns witlunitaction being taking to correct this abuse those who are more immediately resposible for the legislation don here will be called to a fearful account in the coming elections let us now examine somewhat in detail the management of the offiee of public printing the act of congress requires the congressional printer to report annually showing the exact condition of the printing binding and engraving the amount of paper purchased for the same and such further information as may be within his knowledge in regard to all matters connected therewith c notwithstanding this provision of law requiring exact information on the subject of public printing i challenge any member oin this floor to take up any of mr clapps annual reports and say if lie has given anything like exact information on the contraryx his reports are studiously ted purposely inexact and uncertain so much so that when mr clapp gets before n investigating committee it is imnpossible for iiin or the committee to saywbat the piiulic printin does cost look at this report for the year ending september 30 167 3 this report is without a parallel it is not like unto anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in rie waters under the earth unless we except the cattlefish which is said iy naturalists to posse ss the power of renderiig itself invisible by injecting into the witter an inky fluid it seems to be prepared on purpose to conceal the workings of tie office ail to mislead any one who does lnt give it a careful examination i say it without fear of contradiction that there are not five statements in it that can be relied on as a specimen of bookkeeping it is a model the congressional printer has adopted the doubleentry system except occasionally when the treble entry was better adlapled to the object ill view to my mind mr clapp would have appeared to hotter advantage had lie just frankly said i acknowledge i have not kept any correct account of material and labor e but i managed in sonic way to use up 2 085 238 and i thought it would he just as tell to apportion this sum to the several jobs i have done it may be i have charged the postoffice and other departments too much but sometimes i have charged congress too little this is in effect what lie does now sayr althonigh in his report lie professes to be giving things at their cost ill the first iflace i assert that the congressional printer does not account for the sum of 49 317 30 which his own reports show lie had on hand on the 30th day of september 1873 this is such a scrious charge that i ask the house to examine the reports and see if tim following statement made by mr

it the item of paper alone on page 13 of the report for 1873 lie says lit printed 10 000 copies of 790 pages each of the report of commerce and navigation and charged for cost of work paper and binding the scum of 3 595 01 this job required 499 reams of paper and the cost per reatni according to the report would be 7 20 but this paper cost only 6 00 per ream an overcharge of 1 20 per ream or 20 per cent above the al tual cost and amounting to about 600 on the whole job again on page 15 of the same report lie ciargee for printing 2 500 copies of the report of the commissioner of agriculture for 1872 consisting of 8 pages each 32 83 this required about 1 reams of paper charging per ream about 23 about ttree times what it actulily cost the public printer on page 14 of the same report he claims that lie published 1 650 copies of 250 pagee each of the report of the board of public works of the district of columbia cost of paper reported at 242 08 this job required 26 reams at 9 per ream atother overcharge of at least 1 80 per ream or of 20 per cont so you may go oit through the whole report aid you will find the same overcharges in nearly every instance take the report onm the foreign relations of che uaited states amounting to sonic 30 500 volumes in all and the paper charged for this job averages about 7 86 per ream that this is wrong we have only to remember tltat the public printer has nowhere any account of paper costing this sum used in this kind of printing and here i woid remark that mr clapp through a whitewashing report made by the chairman of the senate committee to whom was referred the memorial of the printers of washington on the subject of public pritnting attompis to break the force of these criticisms oil the cost of printing by saying that the ealculattions of the memorialists were based oit erroneous suppositions as to the quantity the quality and tho consequent cost of the paper used as to the quantity of paper used mr clapp himself gives us that and the different formulas adopted in arriving at the exact quantity are so nearly the s uue itat tho discrepancy is trifling bi t lie claims the memorialists ntade an erroneous supposition as to the quality of the paper nsed how easily mr clapp might have saved the tmemorialists frotn falling into this erroneous supposition if like a correct and honest officer he had stated the qtiality of the paper used in his report the law reqtuires him to give tle exact condition of the printing o and by ptrposely withholding such informatio iis report is unsatisfactory and gives no inform1tou of the cost of public printing quantity and quality are the only elements entering into the cost of paper to give the quantity ind omit the quality gave notmore exact information than to omit the quantity and give the qamlity but mr clapp is cardful to say in his communication to the chairman of the committee oil public printing that in one example uncalendered 45pocmd paper was taken by mr judd when calendered 53pound paper was used but the congressional printer is silent as to the other examples it is fair to suppose that if he had the sante reply to make to the other criticisms he would have made it but who is correct about this paper olier parties practical printers have weighed the books auttd say that rhe paper used is uncaendered 45pound paper more than that mr clapp on page 4 of his last report says that under the direction of the committee ott printing he entered into a contract with wheelwright mudge co of baltimore for 30 000 reams of uncelendered 45pound printittgpaper for the year ending december 31 1873 the average cost of this paper per ream was 5 78 it is true he had some of last years paper over and that cost him more but allowing him the very highest price paid for uncalendered paper remaining over it would only cost 6 38j now where has the public printer used the uncamledered paper of 1872 costing 6 38 per ream or of 1873 costing 5 78 per ream there is no place for it no i repeat that the report is loosely and vaguely drawn on purpose to leave a loophole for mr clapp to creep out should he ever be questioned he has been questioned and you can see how he attempts to get out on page 6 of the report for 1872 tl congressional printer says during the past year 119 284 pages of documentary composition have been completed on page 25 of the same report lie also gives the summary of documentary composition at 119 284 ptges by reference to pages 14 19 and 23 i find the kuklux report a book consisting of l3 volumes and containing about 8 000 pages charged three times by this treble entry system of bookkeeping mr clapp takes a credil for 16 000 pages of composition which was never done a mistake of 10 000 pages in an aggregatte of 119 000 pages will i take it inspire no great confidence in the accuracy of mr clapps report every one knows the cost of composition could only be incident to the first 8 000 pages the same principle of bookkeeping was followed in printing the congressional directory for the third session of tie fortysecond congress the first edition consisting of 10 000 copies of 140 pages ca h is stated to have cost 624 66 bhis of course included composition shortly after a second edition of the same number of copies was published costing 542 65 which includes composition a second time yet every member of congress knows that the second clitito is precisely like the first with the exception of here and there a correction made necessary by a change of residence or the election of a new member on page 43 of the report he says the amount of savings it excess of expenditure is 204 812 11 how is this possible if the congressional printer has only charged the cost of labor and material its lie conteids on his theory of charging congress and the various departments the cost of all work done there is no room for profit or loss of course he could arrive at such a balance only by his hocuspocus system of bookkeeping if the printer has obeyed the law there is no place for this balance but when we come to the postoffice departmentwe wi l then see how thisbalance is reached for it is only put in the statement to imislead congress by nmnaing it believe that a profit of nearly 265 000 has been realized during the last year the law also requires the congressional printer to render to congress and the executive departments a detailed statement of the accounts with the various public offices by reference to the annual reports of the government printing office i t will be seen that the accoutts for work done for congress are rentmered very much in detail while those for work done for time l epartments are lumped as for example on page 28 of the last report the congressional printer says ie has performed work for the postoffice department amounting to 220 000 and that is ll we or tit department itself know about the matter what the printing was or the rates it wichit has been charged remains a profound mystery the printing for the various executive departments for last ycir as stated ia this report amounted to 1 210 000 and for the five years past it has amounted to about 5 000 000 for this vast sum of money there has never been a voucher or detailed statement atothing by which the accounts for the work could be examined or even kntown we have the statement of the congressional prin ter that lie has execated work to that extent at snch prices as li has seen lit to charge and these prices he has carefully withheld in direct violation of a express statute during the present session messrs rives bailey in their efforts to procure information for use before the committee came upon the fact that this law led been persistently violated and soon thereafter the cougressional printer was instructed to render from february 1 vouchers with each job of work done for the departments it thus came at last to be known at what prices lie was charging for the work done in his office and it was then plain enough to be seen why there had been no compliance with the law at about this time the appropriation of 175 000 for printittg for the postoffice department was exhausted and the postnasterceneral came before the coimittee on appropriations to ask for an additional sium of money to enable his department to get rise necessary printing lone for the remainder of the year he was not willing to rest under the impttation of having squandered his appropriation in useless priuting and fancy binding and he therefore explained to the coaumittee the mane r in which his money was consumed it there appeared rchat the prices charged against the doparnotmis were perfectly nuheardof out of all bounds of reasonfrom telt to twelve times the actual cost of the work done one bill was rendered for 138 while the actual cost of that job was less than half of that sum another item ehaged at 140 wa~s subsequently modified by the congressional printer himself and reduced to 11 there were many others of like claracter but i will not cake the time to etanuierate them i will refer to one other instance only in this connection and that because of tte enormity of the overcharge it was there shown that rite congressional printer had been in the tabit of charging 3 06 per 1 000 for priuting a few wordsabout live in nunmberupon the envelopes used by the public officeas this work has been done otl a press capable of printing 20 000 per day and at this rate of charging the press was carning for his credit at the treasury 61 20 per day while the expense was 2 per day for a pressman anti 1 50 each for two girls making a total expense of 5 the expenses were 5 and the charge 61 20 or a little more than twelve tinies the actual cost what willtho people think of our public printing offce which eats up half a million dollars worth of paper per annum id thou charges the government twelve times the actual cost of labor expended upon it two million dollars a year are swallowed ip in this manner by this gluttonous establishment when respectable and responsible individuals are anxious even to do our printing for a nmich less sum of money when the congressional printer was confronted by these facts aaad expositions he had the unblushing effrontery to say that lie was not aware his prices were so high lie had not examined them at all he was pursuing the same system he found upon his entrance into office but was nos grateful that his attention had been called to the matter and he would proceed to correct the wroug he was thereupon recqested to revise his charges for the owork done for the postoffice department since the beginning of this fiscal year and see what the same would amount to oii the basis of actual costs he lid sta and concltdes lie could return 40 000 to cli credit of tltat department just where the money came from to be placed to this credit i have not learned i now ask the house to listen to what he calls the actual expense of his work for some half lettersheets circular forms printed in large iuntbers for use in the business of the postoffiet department under the revised schedule the congressional printer has charged 5 41 5 65 6 32 and 6 60 per 1 000 including printing and iaper an offer was made to the department by a firstclass printing establishlmnt in this city without any knowledge of the prices charged at the government printing office to print all that class of work on as good quality of paper for 4 50 per 1 000 not long since the congressional pritter reled flive reams of letterpaper for the postoffice epartment for which lie charged under his revised scale of prices 6 88 a private biudinag and ruling establislmient in this city charges for exactly the same work 75 cents per ream or 3 75 for live reams against time congressional priters 6 88 wlich lie says is the actual cost this is 80 per cent more than the private oflice charges for like work and in addition to this the private office makes a satisfactory prolit the lowest price at which the congressional printer has printed the official envelopes since the revision or his rates is 90 cents per 1 000 and at this rate his press earns for his credit at the treasury 18 per day on an expense of 5 if these charges are correct and no more than the cost of the work done then the government printing office bad better be set on lhle and burned down if no oter way of disposing of it can be foud private parties will do the work for much less money if the charges are more than the costs of the work done why are they so rendered and what becomes of the large margin if there were any money left on hand to the congressional printers credit to represeut these overcharges a satisfactory explanation might be made hut the money is all gone and as a general thing we have been called upon for a deficiency during the last month of the last fiscal year the office was nearly closed up because the money was exhausted and at the same time there was a great press of work to be done the only reasonable conclusion i can reach hi reference to the matter is this by this system the congressional printer has been enabled to report certain work as having been done at a remarkably low fignre and sir hy this same system he has been enabled to do in his office many thousands of dollars worth of printing and binding for private purposes for which no charge whatever has been made when he was called upon two years ago for estimates in regard to the publication of the debates he well knew the work could not be done for the figures lie submitted and e also well knew that it would make no material difbrence because he could easily cover up any defieancy by his regular system of overcharging the departmncuts as evidence that this powerful leverage has been used for this very purpose i will refer you to a few examples the cost of setting tle type for the kuklux report on pages 19 and 23 of the annual report of december 1872 appears to have been about 6 600 this service could not have been performed for ay less than 19 000 but it was desired that the expense should appear to be low and therefore it was charged abott onethird of the cost well knowing that the deficiency was amply covered elsewhere another example of this tiay be found in thefolding of the sheets of the gongressional globe which work in connection with the binding has been done by time congressional printer the folding and gathering of the sheets of the globe during the past five years has cost the government about 25 000 and this expenditure is omitted from the report altogether mut one dollar of it has ever been charged against che work cnd the convenient system of bookkeeping practiced in our public printing enables such things to be done with perfect ease and protection there are scores of shmilar examples which might be referred to for the purpose of showing how this power has been nsed but i will not pause here to allude to them i have been thus particular in explaining the details of the system practiced by the congressional print l that you may all understand just how easy it is for him to say that he is printing the debates within his estimates i now ask your attention to his report of the cost of printing the record during the executive session of the senate in march 1873 and we shall ifiad here a forcible illustration of the colnvenient system of accounting already explained on page 23 of the last annual report we find the charge eutred for printing of the record the cost of the daily edition is stated to have been 249 26 for the 900 copies this charge is said to cover paper presswork fold1g stitching and mailing the typesetting being included in the charge entered against the book edition in the line below when asked by the committee if there were any books in his office showing the separate items of expenditftres making up that amount he replied that he charged tle work up according to his estimtes and bi did not know whether there had been any detailed account of the expenditures kept or not if there had been such a book lie would have produced it and we are left to understand that no such book has been kept it would not suit his purpose to keep such a detailed account of cost lie well knew that his estimates were too low and trusting to the system which had protected him thus far he depended upon it in this ettiergency to enable him to wrest the printing of the debates from the bands of the gentlemen who have served the governnient honcstly and faithfully so long by diligent and patient effort the committee at last suecceeded in asce rtaining from the emplo6s of the office who were engaged upon tls work that there was paid to them for this service 477 60 and by the testimony of the congressioal printer the paper for it cost 170 81 making total cost 648 41 while it is stated in the official report to bc 249 26 but a very little more than onethird of the attud cost and the only excuse or apology offered by him for thus willfully falsifying his official statement to congress was that lie might conforn to his estimates what do you think sir of that style of bookkeeping is it acceptable to coungress is it acceptable to the people who furnish the money that is thus mysteriously nuanipulated i what is the necessity of thus flagrattly falsifying if the condact of his office had been entirely straightforward amid honest if lie has been laboring for the interests of the government in the matter of printing the debates why is there any occasion for him to conceal the truth i when the congressional printer was asked if the cost of stereotyping time book edition was included in his statement of cost given in the annual report he answered that it was not that as stereotyping was not originally estimated for it could not be inchuded in his report because he charged the record up just as the proposals read he admitted the cost to be from 90 cents to i per page and as there were 213 pages to be stereotyped the cost at 1 per page must be 213 this sum is therefore to ie added as a legitimate item in the cost of the work in senate miscellaneous document no 5 first session fortythird congress report of the secretary of the sonate it appears that the making of the index to the record for the executive session cost 75 this money was not paid out by the congressional printer and therefore could not be reported by him but as it is one of the elements of cost and always must be it is to be added to the expense the cost of the book edition is given in the report as 2 104 863 this includes typesetting and the printing on the basis of tie estimates now if we bring these items together we shall have thefollowing book edition including typesettiug 2 104 86 daily edition 8 1 stereotyping 13 0 making index 75 00 total 3 q41 27 these items are none of them disputed by the congressional printer they are all admitted to be correct and we may therefore set this much down as definitely ascertaued this does not include anything for wear and tear of type and machinery nor interest upon tite investment employed there are one or two items more claimed by rives bailey as proper additions to the cost of time work one of which is 125 for gas the congressioat priiiter disputed this itrio and said there was no more gas consiumed oo aecoint of the recorn tlikai there would have been if the work had not been done as gas was consntited for two or three hours each luorning itt both the pressroom and the folditigronin solely oil account of the printing of the debals i am unable to discover why there should not be some allowance made for this iteni of expense but suppose this an all other disputed items be omitted suppose no account is talen of the niany contingent items that always follow a large printing establishment and suppose no allowance ie made for wear and tear and interest on capital we shall then have the acknowledgment of the congressional printer of 3 041 27 as the cost of the work in his official report it is given to us as 2 354 12 only about threefomrths of the actual cost on page 11 of the testimony there is a detailed statement showing that the tntire cost to the governnmat of printing the proceedings of that session under proposition of rives bailey would have been 2 89 26 which is 5 per cent less than the acknowledged cost under the congressional printer and they claini that the difference is really muchgrceater thanthis there is certainly this differcnce in their favor beyond all possibility of dispute and the difference is acknowledged by the congressional printer but sir the proposition of messrs hives bailey now before the house is even lower thai the one submitted by them in february 1873 and tuder which the above comparison is made so if economy is shown in their favor on the basis of their first proposition there will be much inore lnder the one now proposed what clearer stronger evidence than this is desired the congressional printer states on page 9 of his last report that he hada fair opportunity for testing the capacity of this offee for the work and i am fully convinced under that experience that promptness and econoniy are secued by the transfer its resources are so manifold and its economy of labor and mato rial is such tihat at least 30 per cent of the money heretofore expocnded in accomplishing this work will be saved to the government the congressional printerhas here stated what he must have known to be apositive falsehood and what lie has since before the comnittce acknowledged to be such shall we tamely submit to this systematic deception at the hands of a public officer and make no elort to inquire into the motive for such conduct i now come to the present session and i had even more difficulty ill arriving at the cost as the work is now being done because thero was a determined eflirt to deceive and iislead in every respect i have not time now nor is it necessary to pohit out the inaccuracies and contradictions in the tee timony any one who will give the case a careful reading will be able to see for himself in the course of the congressional printers examination he submitted a statement purporting to show the actual expenditure on account of the record during the month of february and he also applied his estimates to the services rendered for the purpose of showing a comparison between actual expense and his esthuates of the same this comparative statement may be found on page 40 of theo testimony amd upon it we have had to depend largely for information a careful analysis of it shows a result entirely dilterent front that which it pretended to exhibit fromn that staement the congressional printer would have us believe that he is now printing the debates nearly 20 per cent less than his estimates and if all his provions statements had been truthful we shonl have been inclined to accept that without question because it bears upon the face of it the appearance of accuracy and at willingness to let the truth be known but when misrepresentation amd deception have been the rule it will not do to accept anything without tim closest scrutiny i will first analyze the application of the estimates to the work done and we conie lplan the first misstatement iu the first line it is stated that the composition would at 1 50 per 1 000 emosthe cstimatedcostamount ot 8 4fi5 55 the actal nicasuremcut of matter was 5 484 000 eiis jnd at 1 10 per 1 000 the cost would be 8 226 the second miiostateiniit is found in the fourth line the 1 292 copies of the rocoled furnished to subscribers are put into this showing not in accordance with the estimates bct at 17 cents per 100 pages the rate at which they are furnished to subscribers and which rate is nearly 10 per cent higher than the estimates each copy of the ricoan for the amonth of february contained 868 pages or 54 sheets and as the estimate was 2 cents for each additional sheet 541 would amount to 1 08j this then is the price per copy of the record under the estiiates for the month of february and 1 92 copies would amount to 1 401 82 instead of 1 906 47 as stated by the congressional printer the next item is presswork on documents 723 there never was any estimate for document printing in connection with the printing of time record and the item should not bt put into a statement which purports to be made out iii arcirdnce with tie estiiiiates the last item is for presswork on cord 155 80 this sir is barefaced iimpudence or inexcusable ignorance but it is in keeping with almost everything we get from that official the estiniate of the congressional printer included in plain terms the paper the presswork folding mailing and every possible service connected with the gettiiig out of the daily editioni and the presswork is therefore included in the 2 cents per sheet before mentioned there is no place in the estimates where presswork is provided for nor is there the slightest justification in the world for ti1e appearance of this item here why should he seek to put it in and thus endeavor to mislead us in our investigation in that way bat these last two items though neither of them has any business whatever in the statement serve the purpose of exposing another instance of the congressional printers charging exorbitant prices on some work that he may do another piece for little or nothing he says there were 241 000 impressions of document work costing 723 ile also says there were 2 258 copies ot the record 868 pages each which would give 250 000 impressions costiig 155 80 documents are charged at 3 per 1 000 and the record at 62 cents per 1 000 as we progress in this statement it is plain to be seen that its character is no better than that of everything else the congressional printer has given to us notwithstanding its very bland appearaice at first the cost under tle estimates would be as follows composition of debates 5 184 000 eos at 1 50 f8 6 00 coniposition of docuentss in wasting tie 225 44 500 copiicsdailyto congress 509 4 466 copies daily to canress 505 l 1 292 copies daily to subscribers 1 40l 82 total 10 863 s8 now as to the actual cost the payroll for the record roon wi have no means of knowing anything about gas bill for recoridroom is said to be 2 21 10 onpage 8 of mr churchs hisimg statesient before the cemnittee will be found a letter from the secretary of the gaslight compaiy stating that of the one lnmdrcd and two burners in te room twoentyfour are supplied from a imeter that is attached to another part of the building therefore the noter ii the record room reports only about three fiurths of the gas consimied il the rooianother effort to make the expetso appearas little 1s possible therefore wanmst add oiiethird of thi gas reported ii order to get the correct quantity this makes that item 293 10 there are several omissions of expense which must be added the clerk in the senate postoffice receives four dollars per day and as he is said to perform some service at the office mornings before coming to the capitol the congressional printer allows threefourths of his wages to be charged to the record there were 3 working days in february and at 4 per day the salaryrof the clerk would amount to 92 threfourths of which 69 is chargeable to the riscord the next omission is the gas consumed in the lpressroom and foldingroom which the congressional printer allows to be 70 36 the next omission is the wages of the watchman 28 days at 3 30 amounting to 92 40 the next omission is for stereotyping 825 pages at 1 per page 825 if we collect together all the items of cost they will stand thus payroll for frlcene room 6 490 05 payroll for foll r 02 47 palyroll for foldiligroom 1 062 58 clerk at senate poatofflce 6900 paper for 06 copies daily to congress 607 08 paper for 1 292 copies daily to subscribers 0 835 8 gas bill for sciroon 293 10 gas bill for press anl fo ling rooms 76 36 w atchi an 28 days at 93 30 92 40 stereotyping 825 pages at fl 8 5 0 actual expense incurod 11 181 32 cast under estimate 10 863 28 differe nco 318 04 so instead of the service already performed by him diring the month of february being 20 per cent below the estimate it is actually aboe the estimate and this showing is more favorable for the congressional printer than any which can be made because the only iten iii his estimates that is sufficient to cover the cost is that of typesetting and tlisis included in the above sta tement by this statement it appears that the typesetting did not cost so much as the estimates within about 1 800 while there was a deficiency oi1 the others of something over 2 100 and when we come to the hound edition every single itei is largely underestimated the service connected with the daily is considerably less than that belonging to the regular nmnber on the bound edition therefore when the entire service is considered the deficiency in the estimates conmes to be large the estimate for the bonid edition was about 10 conts per 100 pages and i now propose to show you that the cost is not less than 15 cents for that quantity of work or 50 per cont more than it was estimated would be the cost in the first place tie only service that is rendered upon the daily and not upon the lioind edition is that of stitching there is the sane amount of paper required there is the same quantity of presswork and the folding and gathering must be done the same for one as the other but there are elements of cost upon the book edition which do not enrter i ate the daily such as drypressing stereotyping printing onl finer paper and at a slower rate of speed these items more tha overbalance the cost of stitching so that the cost of the book edition cannot by any possibility be less than that of t1e daily ad the probabilities are tloat it will be more now the congressional printer charges 17 cents per 10 liwes for the daily reccord to subscribers and this rate is fixed upon undler the authority of the law which allows public documents to be sold for the cost of paper and presswork and 10 per cent thereon this rate tlerefore is to be taken as his acknowledgment of the actual cost and 10 per cent added fromc which by a simple arithmetical calculation the cost is ascertained to be 15 5 cents per t0o pages this point was examined very closely by the committee during the investigation and the testimony of the congressional printer fully corroborated the figures above named at first lie prevarinated as lie did upon almost everything else he said this rate was intended to a pply to ie daily ant iot to the bound edition the chairman thou said question do i then understandl you that the cost of the daily and bound vol unics where composition is includod would be above the 15 5 centa aneer noh i q vohl it sary cssontially a it wold be below that 8omewhat i think iy mr ifale q arc you

100 pages i ayes air that iq the estiocated cost of extra copies for the preeswork and paper then at the bottom of the sanc page 27 but on the following day the congressional printer endeavored to explain again that this rate was lixed upei with reference to the daily edition only and could not apply to the bound edition the committee it appears from tie tstinmmy could not understand how it made any difference what it was intended to apply to if it was the cost that was all there was to tie question whether the purpose was to apply it to the one or the other after some crossquestioning by the chairman as will be seen by reference to pages 2 and 29 the congressional printer finally replied that this rate tree its near the oot as could be approixiated and th comsoi1tee took this as his anier in rcjircscr to the coot now i wish to call your attention to the february stateiient before referred to ad will show yon from it that the rate is not high eniough to cover the actual cost the congressional printer says thu nittinter of copies printed was 2 258 each containing 863 pages thi gives aii aggregate nuuber j 1 959 944 pages the cost of producing this quantity of work is as

fived day the 5th of july 1862 on that day they had ret kelcen and then had fell possession of their origital property aid on that day the united states took the vessel from them by its naval forces and had her libeled in the courts on what ground i not that the confederates had once had firm possession of hot and thereby divested the loyal owners title but that she had been voluntarily employed in the service of the rebellion she was condemned and declated forfeited on that proceeding but the secretary of tl treasury under the authority which the law gave him remitted the forfeiture she was thus so far as those proceedings were concerned as much the propervy of her owners after that remission as onl the 5th day of july 1862 when they were in full possession a possession which would have continuei but for the government seizure and libel which after the remission of the secretoryshould not it seems to use prevent her owners recovering compensation for her use thereafter as if she had never been seized by our government i repeat this vessel was on the day named in this report the 5th of 4uly 1862 in the possession of her owners at saint losis they would have remained entitled to hold her hut for the judgment of this court and the judgment of the court was remitted now since the government when it wanted to use the vessel took her from the owners end used her it seems to me it ought to pay for that nse of her and pay whatever is right but here comes the difficulty of this case the gentleman from ohio suggests with great force that avessel appraised at 45 000 cannot reasonably be worth 66 000 for a little inore than a years 1ne i t not at all competent to judge of the vat e of tbis boats service but that seems reasonable one gentleman from saint louis who sits near me tolls me that he knew this vessel and that 45 000 was a very low appraisement of her that she was worth much more than that we all know that these appraiseoneats are generally made pretty low
