which nearly 4 000 000 of world war veterans are interested at a later date i do expect to ask the indulgence of the house to discuss at some length some of the proposed bills pending in congress to pay all or a substantial part of the face value of the adjustedservice certificates of veterans of the world war i was interested in the splendid address of the gentleman from nebraska who preceded me especially his reference to the payment of the socalled bonus for veterans in cash we have had a number of speeches favoring the proposition this afternoon and no doubt many more will follow in the future but let me suggest that it is action our veterans want and action they must have or else many of our destitute exservice men and their wives and children are going to be hungry while members of congress make speeches eulogizing our men for their valiant services when this great nation of ours was in distress i was amazed a few minutes ago when the gentleman from connecticut read a letter purported to have been written by a past department commander of the american legion of that great state opposing the payment of the adjustedservice certificates at this time by our government and i attempted to ask the gentleman a question but his time was so precious he did not afford me the opportunity i desired to ask the gentleman from connecticut if he really thought the sentiment expressed in that letter reflected the sentiment of the rank and file of the world war veterans of the state of connecticut i can not believe that it does there may be a few excommanders and wouldbe dictators of the american legion who are so rich that they fail to appreciate the critical predicament of thousands of their comrades and who do not need to cash these promissory notes that congress gave to our boys when forced by public sentiment to pass some kind of legislation along this line back in 1924 if the financial depression is as serious in connecticut as in oklahoma and if sentiment is as overwhelmingly in favor of the payment of these notes that our boys are holding against the government i do not hesitate to say that the letter read into the record by the gentleman from connecticut this afternoon could not possibly represent the sentiment of the rank and file of the people of his state i have been attending the hearings on this legislation before the ways and means committee of the house of representatives for the past several days it was interesting to see the veteran secretary of the treasury and one of the wealthiest men of america appear before that committee in opposition to any kind of favorable legislation the veterans have not forgotten that secretary mellon has always been bitter in his opposition to this legislation or anything ever advocated by the exservice men of america why back in the year of 1919 when the american legion convention went on record favoring some kind of adjustment of veterans pay mr mellon was conspicuous by his opposition to any and all proposals in order to defeat favorable legislation secretary mellon began to predict great deficits in the treasury he managed to fool the congress for several years but he yelled wolf so often and made so many bad guesses and the demand for legislation became so insistent that congress finally passed a bill over the presidents veto in 1924 i was also interested in a statement of the undersecretary of the treasury a millionaire who i understand recently inherited 25 000 000 more and who was referred to this afternoon by the gentleman from texas as the official juggler of figures in the treasury department he too is horrified that the exsoldiers in distress throughout this country through no fault of their own have the temerity to come to congress and ask that this government pay them a debt it has owed them since the date of their discharge a debt the congress confessed in the year of 1924 no doubt the undersecretary of the treasury with his twentyfive millions which he did not earn will manage to drag along with his meager salary of 10 000 per year with his swivelchair job in the treasury department but i am pleading for the needy exservice men of america many of whom are in hunger and distress at this moment i am pleading ladies and gentlemen for the loyal and noble wives of these old soldier boys i am pleading for the millions of hungry children for the babies who are unable to speak for themselves and yet who are entitled to food and warm clothing this winter this government owes their daddies on an average of 1 000 each and yet men in authority administration leaders both in and out of congress scoff at the pleas of our world war veterans that congress pay them in cash now as it adjusted the pay of the railroads and steamship companies many years ago i have received many hundreds of letters telegrams and petitions from veterans in oklahoma concerning this important legislation these come from men of all walks of life including physicians attorneys ministers railway trainmen postoffice clerks postmasters bankers merchants and farmers and almost without exception the communications i have received have indorsed legislation to pay all or a substantial part of the face value of the adjustedservice certificates i have here a few of these letters petitions and telegrams and will insert them in the record they speak for themselves the first communication i submit is from hon jim hatcher of chickasha past department commander of the american legion of the state of oklahoma which is proof that all past commanders do not assume the attitude of the one above referred to from connecticut space does not permit me to submit anything like all of the letters i have received within the past few days nor may i make appropriate comment upon these communications i am submitting for publication in the record suffice to say i am confident they express the sentiment of the people of the sixth congressional district of oklahoma hon jed johnson congressman house building washington d c dear jed we have just had one of the largest legion meetings in the history of our post it was held last night and there must have been 300 men present we urged them all to come in because we wanted to take a vote on this compensation bill before congress we presented it from the standpoint of 50 per cent 80 per cent and the face value to be paid in cash now boys were here from cement cyril ninnekah rush springs bradley alex minco tuttle tabler blanchard verden and pocasset and the matter was discussed very freely numbers of men gave their testimony as to their personal condition and stated that they had been employed but since the depression they were not only out of employment but had no funds it seems that the greater part of the members of the american legion and exservice men are men who earn their living by manual labor i have always been against the payment of a bonus in cash that would amount to any great sum of money such as this but of course no condition has ever arisen among world war veterans except right after the war similar to prevailing conditions now and after talking to literally hundreds of fellows i have completely changed my mind and i am absolutely in favor of paying the face value of these certificates in cash at this time it is estimated that there is something like 4 000 000 exservico men in the world today they represent the producing element and i believe that the government could do nothing better than pay these policies and at the same time this payment would not put the government on record as being in favor of the dole system no one who studies the economical conditions of countries and particularly that of england wants the dole system the men who are unemployed in this country do not want money handed out to them as charity what they want is a job the publicbuilding program so far is not taking care of the situation but i believe if this adjusted compensation were paid in cash at this time it would put enough money in circulation to provide for the poor class of people for several months and by that time the different building programs that the municipalities cities towns and the united states government are putting over would tide them over this period of depression in my judgment the farmer is the hardest hit excepting the laboring man who has been laid off and cant find a job there"], [0.014949810691177845, 0.014949810691177845, 0, "by direction of the committee on rules presented the following privileged resolution h res 277 which was referred to the house

imports not taking any particular month very seldom taking a particular year but taking the experience of a period we ascertained the average difference in competitive conditions with which our people have to compete and on this basis justifying the rate we made by the facts thoroughly tested we determined the duties to be levied a duty expresses the point at which protection ceases let me state that again a duty indicates the point at which protection ceases that is there is no protection above that point if the duty is 20 per cent and the competition would justify 30 per cent the effectiveness of the duty ends at the 20 per cent but duties may be at times entirely inoperative owing to domestic competition lin some parts of the country and effective in other sections the effectiveness of any duty depends upon the domestic markets it has been frequently asserted that the duty adds to the price of a commodity in this country and generally it is said that the duty is added to the price of domestic products to the full amount of the duty in order to determine what change in price is made by duty it is necessary to study the market conditions surrounding every transaction affecting the particular commodity it varies from time to time and we believeand there are scores of instances justifying such conclusionsthat the most effective method of advancement of industrial development and the stability of prices and the employment of labor is domestic competition rather than foreign competition our foreign trade amounts to about 9 000 000 000 a year and our domestic transactions to about 90 000 000 000 a yearten times as much as our foreign trade you can cite the cases of aluminum tin and various other articles where we established the industry by a protective duty and where today our people get a better quality of those wares at a lower price than in any place in the world moreover we have considered that the tariff is a domestic question this country adopted the principle of protection as a general policy under president washington various parties subsequently adhered more or less to that principle but the republican party since 1860 has continually adhered to that principle the result has been that we have built up the greatest country on earth from 16 000 000 000 of wealth and 31 000 000 people in 1860 to three hundred and more billions of dollars of wealth multiplying the wealth twenty times and 120 000 000 people multiplying the population four times and presented to the world the spectacle of a country richer living on a higher standard with more employment for labor better markets for products than anywhere else in this world that is because we have said that we are able to manage our own domestic affairs we have no intention of excluding foreign nations from our doors listen to these particular facts under the act of 1922 our foreign trade has doubled and has been doubled for some time we imported in 1927 for instance 4 163 000 000 worth of goods of these 1 483 000 000 came in paying duty and over 2 680 000 000 came in duty free only 36 per cent in value of imported articles paid duty and 64 per cent entered duty free on the dutiable goods we collected not quite 39 per cent ad valorem in duties the average ad valorem on the total of dutiable and dutyfree goods was less than 15 per cent that is not excluding nations from our trade fifteen per cent is a moderate amount to be paid for the privilege of trading in the richest markets on earth which they did nothing to establish they can have their suits tried in our courts if necessary their business is protected by our laws they have an opportunity of free movement for themselves and their goods wherever they wish them to go when properly imported they are not restrained by police regulations or any other restrictions on trade except those which apply to americans as well that the goods must be sound and wholesome if they are food products and not sold under restraint of trade and other salutary regulations for common decency in business now to ask them to pay on the total imports only 15 per cent of the value they have declared which is based not on any basis of valuation of this country but on the value they themselves have declared seems to me to grant to foreign nations wishing to trade with us the privilege of trading on very liberal conditions we have not erected any barrier against any country for punitive purposes because we do not like them or because we have had any disagreement with them there is nowhere in this act or any former act a discrimination against any country unless that country began discrimination against our trade we simply desire to be treated as well as they treated any other nation or as we treat them before i pass on to a discussion of the schedules i desire to speak on four matters in the administrative provisions the administrative provisions have been very thoroughly revised we call it a readjustment of schedules because it is a readjustment but it is a revision of the administrative features many of those features were adopted years ago when the conditions of doing business and the conditions of foreign trade were entirely different from those that exist today at our request the treasury department the tariff commission the department of justice the customs service including the customs court made a very careful study of the administrative features and worked on them for months a very large amount of litigation has arisen and is continually arising under some of the provisions a small change in certain phraseology which has led to the lawsuits and the disputes would cure that condition we endeavored to find out what the language necessary to avoid a multiplicity of suits is they have answered that question for us in this draft that we present you today in both the readjustment of the schedules and the revisions of the administrative features we made no critical examination of paragraphs under which no proposal of change was made if a proposal was not made to change a paragraph it was presumed that those who benefited by it were satisfied or else they would suggest some change if those who operated under it on the other side the importers the foreign agents made no suggestions it was presumed that they were satisfied so in the paragraphs in which no changes are made both in the schedules and in the administrative provisions it was agreed by common consent that they were operating satisfactorily to all parties in interest the first change of importance that we made in the administrative featuresand i am not saying that the others are not important but merely speaking of this as more importantis in the socalled flexible provisions we found as all the country has found also that it took a very long time to arrive at a conclusion under the present lawfrom four to five years in some casesand by the time the conclusion was reached its value was much depreciated except as an historic incident our intentionhasbeen to enlarge the power of the tariff commission to give them greater scope of authority to untie their hands by allowing them to use other means to determine the differences in competitive conditions at home and abroad other than they are now permitted to use and to hasten the date when they must report at first it was thought to be proper to fix the date within four or five months within which the commission must report but that was deemed inadvisable upon further inquiry but we expect that the newly created commission will report very promptly under the investigations it makes under the newparagraph 192q we have recreated the tariff commission the present commission goes out of existence its members will continue until they are supplnted by reappointments of the president and they may be reappointed there is no restriction on their reappointment except to the extent that the president is given a free hand to select the men whom he thinks will best serve the country on this commission we have changed their term of office from six to seven years and have increased their salaries from 9 000 to 12 000 we have increased the number of the commission from six to seven it seemed inadvisable that there should be a commission which by deadlock could not function any commission created to serve thepublic any body created to serve the public ought to be able to function by its majority which must of course assume the responsibility for the action taken it is a universal principle in government that a majority should act and assume the responsibility of its action and a commission that can not function because of deadlock can not be of the greatest public service the provisions for the enlargement of the powers of the coinmissiou are set forth in our report in full and on that report let me say that we have presented a complete picture of the work of the committee there is first the preliminary statement as usual then each subcommittee under its own name has reported on its particular schedule and following the report by each subcommittee is a print of that schedule under the ramseyer rule the old law with the matter to be omitted marked in black brackets and the new language in italics so that anyone reading the report of the subcommittee has an index to the schedule and oi examining the schedule can at once see the reason for the changes that have been made in that schedule it is our puirpose to present to the house and tothe committee a complete picture at once understandable of all the changes that we propose and under the agreement just adopted not long ago on this floor there will be available in the document room by saturday morning reprints of it in larger type for the convenience of the members in the case of the appraisal of merchandise considerable difficulty was found by the government and the customs service in determining finally what the appraised value of merchandise should be it is of interest both to the government and the inporter that the appraisals be promlptly made and the duties be liquidated the importer desires to sell his merchandise and get it out of his hands we provide that under certain provisions detailed in the bill the finding of the appraiser as to the basis of value shall be final and conclusive as a prima facie case and that from that finding appeal may be taken to the secretary of the treasury and his decision slll be final and conclusive likewise as to the basis of value these appraisal cases arise in great numbers dragging their weary way through the courts clogging the business of the government when all that is necessary is for some one to say what tle basis shall be we have sought to remedy file condition by making these provisions it was proposed that we limit the amount of commodities that could be imported from the philippines especially and others of our possessions either in quantity or value the committee rejected such proposals and our possessions have the right of free trade with the united states under this bill in the same measure as they have had it in the past in other words they are still a part of the united states in every respect in trade and otherwise tihe fourth item to which i wish to direct special attention is the subject of valuations i have already called attention to tile difficulties we find in dealing with foreign countries in attempting to ascertain costs of production there one great country has forbidden our agents from making investigations others make it very difficult of course we have no authority no right to demand that that right be given we can not of our own right say to them we must examine your books it is a matter of the comity of nations and that permission they are becoming unwilling longer to extend we have considerable difficulty in the natter of valuation of imports undervaluations or where imports come in from the sane country for instance from the same seller to different buyers in this country at different invoice values one may be a better buyer than another or may buy in larger quantities and get a reduction in the price and he imports at one price and a less successful buyer imports at another price there are a great many other difficulties we are proposing that the president of the united states make an investigation of all the proposed methods of valuation i this country to determine their practicability by a srientific investigation and to report to congress on the several plans of valuation that may be administrable if possible in this country for the subsequent action of congress speaking for myself only having had experience in the preparation of two tariff bills and knowing the difficulties we have labored under generally in any attempt to find out whal the foreign costs were i believe we shall come in a short time to some form of valuation in the united states as the only solution of the problem of dutiable values it will be fair to foreign countries for now if goods come in from czechoslovakia at a very low rate and come in from the english possessions at a much higher rate although serving the same purposes and possibly selling at the same prices in this country the english producer or seller pays a much higher duty than czechoslovakia and thus we are giving an advantage to the nation of the lower wage scale or lower standard of living the foreign wages average only about 40 per cent of the american wages and in some countries they do not equal 10 per cent of our wages in certain lines of industry abroad much production arises from home work at almost no cost of production being done by women and children for which they receive no wage but only get their living in the family it is impossible to distinguish between goods brought in so made and goods made otherwise such goods might also be remanufactured before reaching our shores the only way to readjust that fairly to all our foreign neighbors is to adjust the duties on the basis of some administrable form of american value so that they will all pay the same amount of duty now i wish to comment briefly upon the schedules we have in our report set out very extensively the changes made in the chemical schedule out of 93 paragraphs only 39 changes were made thirtythree were increases and six were decreases that schedule contains hundreds of items the duties on 33 commodities were raised and on 6 were lowered in all the schedules you will find that we have added a large number of products that have heretofore been concealed in basket clauses or are new products if an article is imported under the basket clause no separate account of it is made by the customs and in order to get information as to the imports in quantity or price it is necessary to go to the ports of entry and examine all the invoice sheets on such items we have found it very difficult many times to ascertain tie proper duty to be assessed upon any import because the item was in a basket clause and the data regarding such imports were not separately reported in this bill we have increased the number of items by name by several hundreds in order that they may be separately reported in the customs and we may have report in complete detail of the amount imaported the value the rate of duty the duty collected and the ad valorem of that duty in the second schedule on earthenware changes have been made to meet the necessities of certain lines of products a careful examination of these schedules will indicate that the changes made generally are few in number as compared with the total items in the schedule and that the amount of the change is not large examining the bill not long ago i was surprised at the number of times the change of 5 per cent only occurredfrom 25 to 30 per cent or from 35 to 40 or from 15 to 20 per centwhere the industry needed a slight addition to its protection to prevent its being so greatly embarrassed that it could not proceed we have found in our investigations a considerable number of industries which are going on because it is less expensive to continue operating tit a loss than it is to close up the industry they have continued operating hoping for relief if they close up their industry they lose their organization they lose their trained labor they lose their markets and they lose all the value of their advertising anmd if they ever resume they have to repeat their advertising regain their markets reassemble their labor and rehabilitate their plants these industries are in the red but with the changes we propose they will at least be put back oni a competitive basis their labor will continue to be employed we will have the benefit of their products and the competition they afford we will also have the benefit of the increased wealth of our country by their total of manufactures in the metal schedule and in the earthen schedule the question of building materials arises there is no change on pig iron over that proposed by the president we have adopted the presidential rates in practically every instance if the flexible tariff provision is sound and its findings are to become the law of the country after long investigations have been made on the products affected we came to the conclusion they should be adopted after we had examined them we were satisfied they represented the right rates we did not accept any presidential rate that i remember without reinvestigation we are your agents and you asked us to be certain before we made any change that the change was justified upon investigations made by ourselves on common brick we have put a duty of 1 25 per thousand that affects only the manufacturers in the hudson river territory it will not affect the rest of the united states because the local competition in the brickyards in every other section of the united states will determine the price at which the bricks will be sold in that locality but bricks were coming into this territory as ballast and avoiding the question of dumping by a narrow margin they were coming in at a low transportation rate and were underselling the american brick when they were being manufactured and sold on a proper basis of profit the price in that section has been reduced several dollars in a short time by these importations of brick cement has been given a duty of 8 cents per 100 pounds which is equal to 30 4 cents per barrel the same remarks apply to that as apply to brick it is a problem involving only the atlantic coast extending from boston excluding new york down along the southeastern coast of the united states it is a coast problem it will affect in both instances coast products and if it raises the price at all it will raise it only in the coastal sections of the country because the cost of transportation to the interior would prohibit the foreign brick from moving very far in iron and steel there is practically no change as to building materials except where duties have been imposed upon certain alloys used in hardening and toughening steel sheathing for piling has been given a small added rate in the metal schedule i think the most important change was in the watch and clock paragraphs these paragraphs were adopted years ago and the customs service have not been able recently to make them work satisfactorily the descriptions are ancient the basis for the collection of the duties is antiquated the whole watch production has changed its nature and its method of manufacture so that these paragraphs have been entirely rewritten and revised the duties have been materially changed because the american manufacturer was not able to compete with the manufactures coming in from abroad especially from countries whose wages are only a small fraction of ours the wage cost of a commodity from the time it begins as a raw product until it ends in the finished material is the greater portion of its cost of production and usually of its selling price in any complicated manufacture as is the case of watches the labor cost is the very large proportion 75 or 80 per cent possibly more in some of the finer watches of the entire cost of production suppose a watch costs 100 abroad the wage cost here would be three or four times as great as such cost abroad that gives the foreign manufacturer an advantage against which our own people can not compete that would apply to any number of products in the case of wood and its manufactures we have made these changes lumber from pine fir hemlock and spruce the four great lumberproducing materials are on the free list logs have a duty of 1 per 1 000 feet board measure but the lmportation of logs is insignificant as compared with the total production of lumber iron and steel building materials and lumber are practically unchanged except as elsewhere stated in regard to lumber there is a duty of 25 per cent on imports of cedar and shingles because of strong and longcontinued competition between the mills of british columbia and the northwest cedar lumber comprises but a very small percentage of the lumber manufactured in this country it grows in the woods in connection with other trees but not in great quantities there are certain localities where there may be forests of cedar but that is not true generally because cedar is found along the little streams or at the headwaters of small streams and it is like the tulip tree or yellow pine in that it likes the damp places where the springs are shingles have been given a rate of 25 per cent ad valorem maple and birch of interest to the old northwest around the great lakes and to the west have been given a duty of 15 per cent there has been but little increase as to other wood and manufactures of wood in sugar the duty on 960 sugar has been fixed at 3 cents as compared with 2 20 at present against all the world the duty against cuba for 96 sugar which is that commonly referred to when we speak of the sugar schedule will be 2 40 as against 1 76 in the present law the greater proportion of our sugar that pays duty comes from cuba and this will make an increase of 64 cents per 100 pounds the experts before the connmittee including doctor bates of the bureau of standards who i think probably knows more about sugar than anybody else in the country made the statement that when the american sugar is on the market we get our sugar cheaper than any other time when the american sugar is available for the people to buy they pay less for sugar than they do when american sugar is not on the market"], [0.020290493965148926, 0.9797095060348511, 1, "a recent issue of the washington star carried a

the american legion has formally indorsed the proposal to make cash payment of the adjustedservice certificates held by veterans of the world war what reason can the republican house leaders give for further delay up to this time they have been hiding behind the fact that the legion convention held last year at boston tabled a resolution regarding this matter the veterans of the nation are almost a unit in advocat ing the immediate payment of these certificates to those who wish to avail themselves of such opportunity it is pointed out that during the present economic depression thousands of veterans are out of work many have bought homes and fear they may lose them many others would like to buy homes and farms while prices are low these certificates represent an obligation of the united states to the veterans which congress has recognized to pay them now will benefit not only the veterans and their families but will put into circulation approximately 3 000 000 000 and certainly such an act would stimulate business everywhere in our land thus benefiting all citizens it is claimed that the government has not the money but it can borrow the money at 3 per cent or less the secretary of the treasury has just recently asked congress to per mit the refunding of eight billions of liberty bonds in order that a lower rate of interest may be secured if such action i is advisable does it not follow that the government could easily sell bonds to pay the veterans there are hundreds of millions of dollars today lying idle in savings banks drawing 3 per cent or less many banks have recently found it necessary to reduce the interest rate paid on savings accounts they would be glad to buy the bonds or the depositors themselves would be glad to exchange their savings accounts for government bonds which are taxfree in georgia practically every legion post is on record so i am informed favoring payment of the certificates such action would place in georgia more than 75 000 000 it would benefit every man woman and child in georgia most of all it would save many a veteran and his family from actual want in the present emergency the gag rule leaders of the republican organization in the house following the dictates of their master secretary mellon have so far refused consideration to the more than 50 bills pending for payment of these certificates it is an outrage that a few powerful leaders can thus thwart the will of the other members of the house they are perpetrating a wrong against the men who offered their lives to their country during the war the veterans of the nation ought and i believe they will remember these leaders in the future and replace them with men willing to permit fair consideration to such meritorious legislation more than a hundred members of the house have signed a petition asking consideration of this legislation i am glad to number myself in that body and i expect to continue to do all within my power toward securing speedy enactment of a bill to pay such veterans as wish to be paid practically every democrat in the house favors this plan and that includes all of the georgia delegation it has been argued that the veterans would waste the money there is no logic in this argument those inclined to waste the proceeds of their certificates are annually borrowing the limit on them every year and paying interest to

shoals the house ratified those principles in 1924 when it passed the ford offer the house again ratified those principles in 1925 when it set up the muscle shoals inquiry and the house again in 1926 ratified those principles when it set up the joint committee these principles are not so important because they were laid down by the military affairs committee or because they were ratified by this house but they are most important in the fact that only by an adherence to them can the farmers of the country expect or hope for any fertilizer relief from muscle shoals whenever you throw aside those principles as they have been cast aside in the pending bill then you strike down you shatter all hope of fertilizer relief for the farmers at muscle shoals"], [0.029344210401177406,

the child if he will let us feed the jack and put a willing hand behind him there will be no trouble about the child about how far are we going with this thing anyhow my understanding is that this is about the sixth appropriation of this kind that we have made calling on uncle sam for help originally we called upon the federal government to make a loan to thefarmers to purchase seed in a droughtstricken area that went over all right my understanding is that on that there is about 15 per cent loss to the government then they said we must have feed to help us put out a crop well they had that then they came and said we must have fertilizer and we made a loan for fertilizer that went along pretty good now they come and say that they must have food to feed the families about the next thing will be a loan for money to buy the mule and pay the rent we will have to stop it some place a greatdeal is being said about feeding the family i am well aware thatin some parts of the country it has been the custom for the landowner to furnish seed and fertilizer and food for the family they produce the crop and the tenant gets his share and the landowner gets his share now agriculture is somewhat of a hazard as well as other lines we come along with the drought proposition the tenant gets the loan and it relieves the landlord of that much he has nothing against the crop but the obligation out for the seed and everybody knows that it does not take a great amount of money to buy seed for the crop he is not taking any hazard the farmer will get his seed and fertilizer for the land and then the tenant will get his share of the crop and the owner will get his he will see that the man gets enough to eat early vegetables come on and they will have that but you take every industrial worker in the city out of a jobhe has nothing except what some one gives him there is not a farmer worthy of the name that has not got something that he has produced that he can eat he has milk poultry products and vegetables and does not need much outside help to have enough to eat take it out in my country we have the problem of taking care of needy people our people are as hard up as they are everywhere else i have a newspaper clipping in my pocket which i will not read now but they had a meeting of the board of supervisors last week in one of the counties in my district and what kind of a proposition are these people up against fortunately they raised enough to feed them and have seed next year but what was the situation the board of supervisors found that of 76 000 in taxes they collected last year 51 000 of that was paid out for the maintenance of the poor for the poor farm widows and blind pensions and left them with 26 000 to pay for the running expenses of the county they had issued 45 000 of anticipation warrants for meeting the bills as they come along did they call upon uncle sam to help feed the poor no they proceed to organize by townships people must come along with their money and contribute and organizations of women in each township collect clothes and shoes to keep the families warm that is the proposition that they are up against these men are paying commercial rates for interest nearly every farmer has some money borrowed but he is not expecting uncle sam to come and feed the poor in his neighborhood because he expects the different communities to take care of that themselves i say to you that i think they are mighty charitable to me when i go back and tell them that i know that they have enough to winter their stock and to feed their livestock and to seed their land the next year but that these other poor fellows have not and i voted for 30 000 000 to buy them seed to feed their teams and gasoline for their tractors and to buy fertilizers it looks to me as though we were running a pretty vicious circle here when we are loaning money to buy fertilizer to produce a large surplus and then again loaning money to take that surplus off the market i do not know where that is going to end but at any rate we realize the gravity of the situation and if i wanted to demagogue i would go back and say

of the world no incident so dramatic has marked the maritime development of the united states during the past 75 years it was american enterprise which in 1816 started the first line of transatlantic packets the famous black ball line between new york and liverpool it was the further effort of american shipping men that between 1816 and 1840 was responsible for the establishment of some 10 other lines of fast sailing vessels which throughout that period dominated the transportation of mail and passengers between america and europe on the longer trade routes from the atlantic to the pacific and to the orient it was the american clippers which between 1843 and 1860 established world speed records for sailing ships that have never since been equaled by 1840 steam was beginning to take the laurels away from sail in the north atlantic but for a number of years following 1850 the united states again took the lead under the new power in november 1847 the united states government had contracted with edward k collins a conspicuous new york merchant and shipping man for the establishment of a line of mail steamers under the american flag between new york and liverpool by 1850 mr collins had completed the four finest steamships which had yet been built vessels which were able to shorten by more than a day the average passage time of the cunard line which had been established about 1840 by the aid of british subsidies for several years the collins line continued to stand for the best in the transatlantic service but in 1854 one ship was lost at sea and in 1856 another by acts of congress in 1856 and 1858 the mail pay was radically curtailed and immediately after the latter reduction the col ins line went out of existence from 1850 until the world war the only effort of note to place the american flag in the transatlantic service was that of the american line which in the nineties bought the ships naew york and paris and built the ships st louis and st paul of spanishamerican war fame neither the establishment of the american line nor any other attempt at earlier or later dates to found an americanflag transatlantic passenger service was however anything
