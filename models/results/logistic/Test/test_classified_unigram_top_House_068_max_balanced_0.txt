it would have gone out of the bill because there is no law whatever for it and a point of order would have killed its appropriation yet we have made no such points of order and allowed each year the

you how careless the people of washington are concerning this howard university the general education board of new york proposed to washington last year that the general educational board would give 250 000 to the medical department of howard university in washington if they would raise 250 000 to offset it thus raising for them 500 000 needed for their medical department washington people had a

colleague from texas i agree with him on many things i disagree with him however on some occasions i am not surprised to find him crossing swords with me now for it is only natural that lie should be found backing up the boys who are about to have some expenditures of public money taken from their districts whenever there is any congressional foraging you will find my distinguished friend from the rio grapde leading the expedition but he has intimated that my introducing certain bills to provide postoffice buildings in certain cities in my district is inconsistent with the fights i make here for economy in governmental expenditures that is the question is there inconsistency i am perfectly willing to sul mit my record here in decision of the question i have been here since the beginning of the sixtyfifth congress which met in april 1917 in every possible way without any exception i have fought against passing any omnibus bill to construct postoffice buildings during my entire service here in congress and no such bill has been passed during my entire service in congress i am one of those who has been against constructing new postofiee buildings until our government gets back on its feet financially we must first recover from the ravages of the war i have stood with those who havg prevented such a bill from being passed during the nearly eight years i have been here int in each congress during this time introduced similar bills such as my friend called attention to a while ago why did i do it because we all know that whenever an omnibus bill is reported for passage to construct new postoffice buildings every memiber here of the 435 congressmen will be given his pro rata share that is a certain number of such buildings within a maximum limit will be allowed to each district to be placed wherever the representative of that district designates and if we who have opposed such a bill had been outvoted and such a bill had been reported for passage certain buildings would have been allotted to may district for cities design 111 by me within the maximum limit of appropriation allowed me and while i was against such a measure passing until our government recovers financially still if the passage of such a bill could not be stopped i wonted my district to get its share of the new postoffice buildings to be constructed under an omnibus building biii and i introduced the bills mentioned to indicate to the committee on public buildings and grounds where i wanted the new buildings my district would be entitled to located i am still of the opinion that our government is not yet able to engage upon this building plan of our friend from kentucky to construct new postoffice buildings all over the united states i intend to fight on this floor with every ounce of force that is within my being against any such public building bill being passed in this sixtyeighth congress it is unwise we are in a state of great unrest our people are taxed heavily they re hearing the burden crossly and imipatiently they are demanding relief we can afford relief only through retrenching expenditures we can not reduce taxes in ainy other way for every 100 000 building that is given to one of out small cities we who represent the smaller cities to get it would have to give at least 1 000 000 to each large city district for every congressman would have to have his slice of the pie and the city slices are always larger in proportion to the population of the city because it is always contended that in 11 large city the building must be built with equal gradeur alid magnificence as the other buildings and probable growth of the city would justify and under such circumstances in imany instances good substantial postoffice buildings that would answer time needs of the people for several years to come are torn down and replaced with modern structures of magnificence if we were back on our feet financially and could afford it i would not oppose such construction i am just as much in favor of beautiful new things as any of my colleagues are when it can be afforded but our government can not yet afford this proposed building plan the good people i

nation i can not consistently support the present bill as reported by the ways and means committee there are some good features in the bill as reported and i want to congratulate the committee upon them but my chief reason for not supporting the bill in its present form is the apparent discrimination between the large and small taxpayer it has always been the theory and practice of this government in levying a tax for the administration of the government that the rich shall bear the largest portion of the burden of taxation it is a fundamental principle that the strong by their financial help shall support the weak and i can not interpret the bill in its present form in any other way than that it is discriminatory in the question of surtax the main issue the billas reported seeks to cut the surtax of the rich from 50 per cent to 25 per cent which is relieving this class of exactly 50 per cent of its present incometax burden while the taxpayer whose income is below 30 000 is only getting a 25 per cent reduction when we seek to lift the burdens of taxation from the wealthy and fasten them on the poorer classes we are endangering the very fundamental principles if taxation and should this bill be extended too far along thisiline it would ultimately result in the destruction of the incometax system and would cause unrest and financial chaos in our nation the man who receives tan income of 30 000 to 100 000 and upward usually receives it from dividends as disclosed by public records should he be relieved instead of the man or woman with an income earned by toil the district in west virginia represented by me has between 275 000 and 800 000 people this is divided into about four classes there are a few millicaires but i want to say to the gentlemen of this house that with very few exceptions they are men with big open hearts and are ready willing and anxious to bear their just proportion of taxation when a civic improvement is launched for roads schools or nther improvements by the issuance of bonds they are the first to go out and champion the cause and help put it over neither are they lobbying around washington ior writing and wiring their representative to support the mellon tax plan in the manner other representatives are being appealed to along this line iwill admit i have received hundreds of letters and telegrams requesting my support of the tmellon tax plan but with few exceptions they have come from multimillionaires from outside my district the next class is the small business man vh6 is likewise big hearted and loyal the third class is the laboring manthe man who goes under the earth in the coal mines and who works on the railroads of west virginiawhose income ranges from 1 5001 to 3 000 the fourth class is the farmer who is not affected by the present inconm tax for the reason that he is operating ata loss and has been since 1921 heis in a class by himself what he has to buy is a great deal higher than before the war and still climbing higher all the time iand what he has to sell he is compelled to sell at a price less than the cost of production this condition i want to impress upon you gentlemen is brought about by the action of the republican sixtyseventh congress by its passage of the iniquitous fordneymccumber tariff bill the poor miner and railroader are likewise affected he hardly makes a living he toils long and steadily his work is hazardous yet lie is forced to contribute to the coffers of the t custs from the time he sweetens his coffee at breakfast until he goes to bed at night and unless this tariff is repealed lie will have to continue to do this on most of the articles lie purchases from the time he begins to struggle for a living until he dies i hope and sincerely believe that this condition will be greatly remedied after this yeari mean after the next election when a democratic congress and president are elected there are other unjust discriminations in this bill the reduction on the estate tax is in my judgment a very unwise thing it is fundamentally wrong for a person to come into possession of a large estate which is built up without any will or effort upon his part to be relieved or almost entirely relieved of forfeiting any part of this to the treasury of the government it is like receiving something for nothing and certainly a part of it should revert to the government in the wartax exemptions i notice that yachts are not taxed who owns yachts i can say to you frankly that although we have some navigable streams in west virginia you will find no miners railroaders or small business men owning private yachts but in new york and other places you will find most every millionaire owning one why should they not pay a tax on these vessels the arguments of the proponents of this bill are not logical it is a known fact that in order to produce revenue by taxation the wealth of the country must be taxed and the very idea that to relieve the rich man of 50 per cent of his surtax as now paid or 44 per cent as held in the garner bill would produce more revenue is unreasonable and unreliable when we want money where do wo go to get itto the man who has it or to the man who has not it therefore in order to produce revenue from taxation it is necessary to tax those who have wealth there is another peculiarity about this bill it is called the mellon tax bill it originated in the office of the secretary of the treasury with few exceptions it is reported out of the committee exactly as dictated by mr mellon the democratic minority had to depend entirely upon men selected by mr mellon to examine the treasury records to report the approximate amount of revenue that would be derived under the garner plan mr mellons estimates as to the probable condition of the treasury in the future given at various times when the conditions warranted it are peculiar for instance when the matter of the soldiers bonus came up in the sixtyseventh congress mr mellon gave out an estimate that the treasury was facing a deficit of something over 3 000 000 000 and that if the bonus were passed it would be far more yet in a year from this time he seeks to put through a tax reduction probably for political purposes in which he shows a large surplus in the treasury of several million dollars now be says that if the garner bill is passed it will create a deficit in the treasury and if the mellon plan is adopted thdre will be a surplus at the same time lie recommends that the surtax be cut from 50 per cent to 25 per cent on the wealthy gentlemen these estimates of mr mellons according to my opinion to say the least are not reliable mr mcadoo and others who are just as expert as mr mellon show that the garner bill if passed will not leave a deficit but will on the other hand create a large surplus according to the statistics in my state last year there were 75 277 people making incometax returns out of this number under the proposed mellon plan the number benefited more than by the garner plan would be 63 while the number benefited more by the garner plan would be 75 214 and as i was elected and sent here to participate in legislation by a majority of my constituents i deem it my duty to vote for such economical and just measures as will benefit the largest number of my constituents hence i will support and vote for

frmoii new york i chairman of the legislative coinnnit lee on indian affairs which committee has jurisdiction over all legislative matters affecting the indians introduced and secured the passage of a bill authorizing appropriations for certit activities of the indian service and a classification of authuize expenditures is to be found in that authoriztiimi act the committee in the preparation of this bill has very lirgely altered the formation of tlht part of the bill relating to iiidma items we have we think greatly improved the forni of the bill we think it will conmend itself to the flouse tecause it is in tie direction of giving you greater information and very probably makes it nore easy for you to criticize the 795 committee which framed the bill but we must of course take the responsibility for our acts under the old form there was more or less of a geographical arrangement which on the face of it seemed to indicate the apportionment of expense by states but as a matter of fact so much additional was carried in certain lump sums outside the geographical arrangement that there was not any real information given by that arrangement if you desired to know how much was given in the bill for education how much for irrigation how much for medical relief the bill was a hodgepodge and it did not give the practical information which you would most desire so in this rearrangement the committee has availed itself of the scientific i may say classification that was presented in the snyder act as you will find in reading such headings as industrial assistance irrigation and drainage education relief of destitution and conservation of health general support and civilization and so forth i repeat i hope this change will meet with the approval of the house it involved much more labor on the part of your committee than you would very well realize the outstanding features of the bill as to indian matters i will call attention to as briefly as i atim under the head of industrial assistance the appropriation for the current year is 467 000 the budget estimate was 462 000 for 1925 the bill before you carries 535 000 which is 63 000 above the current law and 68 000 above the budget this is due to increase practically in one item the item relating to industry among the indians on page 24 of the bill that item is one that has been carried for several years it is a reimbursable item it is used to furnish seed tools stock and other animals to the indians the cost of such seed stock and so forth to be reimbursed to the government later by the indians in the early days of that appropriation larger sums were carried and some expenditures for tribal herds were made which did not prove to be well administered and in recent years the item has carried a prohihition against any part of that fund being used for the purchase of tribal herds the item before you carries that limitation but it does however permit the purchase of stock and so forth to be furnished to individual indians the notable thing about it is that out of the about 4 000 000 that has been used in that way over 3 000 000 has already been repaid to the treasury as i say it is a reimbursable item that actually does reimburse in addition those who are most familiar with the ind an problem such as my very honored colleague mr canrim of oklahoma the indian commissioner mr burke

at all we have to come to washington last year i voted against this bill and we stated our objections we objected to taking a boy 100 miles to a federal court fine him and put him to much expense and trouble for that reason we were opposed to the bill i think the gentleman from massachusetts who opposed the bill and offered the motion to strike out the enacting clause would state that as his principal objection if not the entire objection this bill has met this objection and i sincerely hope that section 6 will be made to apply also to the fine of 5 and 25 and not included in the 500 i have been convinced that this is really something for the benefit of the poor man and that it will furnish a place for him to shoot in a territory where he will not be regarded as a trespasser"],

his discussion appears on pages 6333 6334 6335 6336 and 6337 of mondays record as a clinching argument for his bill he cites the rental experience of mr massey who is a tenant of mr harry wardnman in the new berne apartments who had been notified that his rent was going to be increased to 75 from his remarks i quote mr massey further testified that he had been living in the new berne apartment house practically since it was built that he had three rooms bath and kitchen that in april 1917 he was paying 35 for the apartment but that this was increased to 37 50 in october 1917 and in september 1920 the rent was raised to 50 that he had a wife and two children that his salary with bonus was 2 240 even without giving the full evidence concerning this new berne the above statement alone condemns the rent commission and proves conclusively that it causes rents to be raised rather than lowered for this rent commission has been functioning since october 22 1919 yet notwithstanding this rent commission mr masseys rent was raised from 37 50 to 50 per month in september 1920 which raise occurred a year after the rent commission was created and mr massey continued to pay such increase from september 1920 to march 1924 nwithout relief when he received another notice of another raise right in the teeth of such rent commission does this not prove how useless it is does it not prove that it causes raises does it not prove that it is important to stop raises does not this evidence convict the rent commission of being worthless but the gentleman from wisconsin should have been fairer he should have given you all of the testimony concerning the new berne he should at least have given you more of mr masseys testimony and this is the main reason that debate was necessary

sympathy with president wilson through his long wasting illness and your admiration of his great service to our country and his sublime sacrifice in the service of mankind i join heartily in every feeling you so well express let me try to tell you how he impressed me and the impress he has made on the minds of all men who studied him with friendly care woodrow wilson is dead but his impressive example goes on for all time pointing to succeeding generations the true passway to the heights where the f and glory of great unselfish service abides i knew him as well as he was known to any other senator and my admiration of the mal had no bounds his confidence in me of which he gave conspicuous evidence abides a dear memory as long al time with me shall last for his matchless intellect his unselfish devotion to duty his proud and ardent patriotism his far vision his big purpose his clear sense of justice his intense desire to be of service to his country and mankind impelled my profound admiration for him as a man and boundless respect for the quality and tone of his public service his superb intellectual equipment his love of justice backed by a noble courage to see the right prevail made him a great leader in any cause that engaged his heart and satisfied his judgment in his differences with honest sensible men on a question of any importance he relied on reason and justice as his buckler and shield and in such conflict there was none so adroit or strong as to pierce his armor or inflict a wound panoplied in the cause of right he met the greatest responsibilities with supreme confidence and audacious courage and neither quality weakened under any strain that could be put upon it these qualities likewise made him the great civilian commander in chief of our army and navy enabled him to sumnmon every ablebodied man and every resource of land and sea machinery and money to hasten the end of the last great war that earth should suffer he failed in his sublime purpose but by no weakness or doubt in him leading the moral forces of the world he fell on the field of armageddon fighting for the lord we speak of our martyr presidents every one of whom fell at the hands of crazy assassins but in woodrow wilson we behold the soul and spirit the suffering and sacrifice of a real martyr spending himself and lying for the greatest cause that ever thrilled the heart or engaged the mind of man he had ambition but it was unstained by the selfish motive his enemnies attributed to it his ambition was of that noble quality and fine fiber desiring to serve his country and mankind and to leave behind him an honored name and a world made better and happier by his service he was the animating spirit of a great crusade not to wrest the tomb of christ from the hand of the infidel but he staked his life and died trying to revive the mission of him who came to bring peace on earth aild good will among men he did not rush his country into war he avoided it perhaps too long lie felt and once said that our swoid should not be drawn until the approving smile of god would flash on its blade at last finding appeals and protest of no avall our national honor assailed our flag insulted the seas outraged and civilization itself threatened lie went with a burning heart and pitying eyes into the vortex of awful war with the avowed and predetermined purpose to make it the last by common consent of civilized nations that should ever stain the earth with blood or moisten it with tears this high wellknown purpose gathered to him the hearts and hopes of a despairing world and placed him for a time at least on heights never before trodden by man what a world tragedy in his fall it came after armed hostilities had ceased but the lasting peace for which he strove was yet unsecured with this great purpose unaecom lishled he felt that the boundless blood and treasure had been spent in vain the world had been only brutalized not ennobled by the holocaust the great struggle had been transferred from time fields of france to the forum of america one purchased seat in the senate gave full cantrol of congress to his political opponentsamong whom were jealous enemies aided further by bitter personal enemies in his partyand the fight against the peace pact was immediately begun in bitter earnestness this is not the time to go deeply into that matter the fateful results are well known to a turbulent and unsettled world with more reason the advocates of the treaty can lay the hungry helpless hopeless condition of the world to the timidity and selfishness of the one nation strong enough and with influence enough to have secured without material injury to itself the permanent place of the world and the manifold blessings it would secure to civilized mankind the great heart the wide vision the alert mind of woodrow wilson are let us believe now enjoying that peace he so much loved he did not live in vain that peace among men for which he strove and died will come or civilization will perish from the earth he has broken the trail for great hearts and nations to follow and they will follow in numbers adequate to reach the goal and when that day shall come be it soon or be it late the memory and example of woodrow wilson will remain crying as the voice of john in the wilderness of judea lrepare ye
