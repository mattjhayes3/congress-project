project which was here last year had a benefittocost ratio of over 3 to 1 it is very seldom that a project of this character comes in and that is the reason this project will pay out over a period of 40 years with interest on the municipal water and a return to the federal government of 10 million more than the 27 million which the project will cost the need for this project is predicated upon the unique characteristics of the area in particular the geography of the area and the rainfall characteristics ventura is located on the coastline the ventura river is about 20 miles long thus being a very short river the mountains which lie immediately east of ventura rise to 6 000 feet and of course then the ground slopes from there to sea level the erratic rainfall which occurs in the winter comes down off the mountainside and sweeps to the coastal plain in devastating floods then the streams dry up leaving the people parched and without water the streamflow of the ventura river varies from some 3 000 acrefeet annually to over 225 000 acrefeet annually there will be in some years tremendous amounts of water as much as 200 000 or 225 000 acrefeet coming down that stream and perhaps in the next year there will be only 3 000 acrefeet of water the purpose of this project is to catch these floods and to equate the availability of that water over a period of years in order to make the water available for domestic municipal and irrigation uses some concern has been expressed from time to time about crops the crops raised in this area are uniquely the california types oranges

of food i warn you this shortage could occur again the question has been raised here about what might be raised on that land i think the report shows that 36 percent of the land had been planted to wheat that was on the foss project alone we do not irrigate wheat so we will not raise wheat that is then less wheat to add to the now existing surplus you will have more alfalfa grown and other crops that are not in surplus indeed less than 1 percent of the corn and wheat is grown on irrigation projects of the 2t million acres of irrigated land under federal control less than 1 percent is added to the crops that are presently in surplus so i would not worry too much about what will be produced yes there was some opposition and some questions were raised in the 83d congress i think it was wise

for those human rights let us without further delay act upon this unfinished business of civil rights begun long ago and shamefully neglected through 80 years of our history congress began the business of establishing a federal program to protect the liberty security and citizenship privileges of all persons in this country back in 1866 when it enacted the first of the socalled civil rights statutes in the years between 1866 and 1875 congress laid down a comprehensive program for the federal enforcement of the civil rights guaranties of the 13th 14th and 15th amendments since 1875 these laws have withered away during these long years congress has revised some of the original statutes and repealed others the supreme court has invalidated still other sections the result has been to reduce the statutes in both number and substance until the program of enforcement is only a shadow of its former self little is left today of that original legislation yet in spite of the obvious and flagrant abuse of civil rights that we see around us and read about each day in the papers congress has repeatedly refused to take action on proposed substitutions or additions eighty years and we still have no strong federal program to make sure that the 13th 14th and 15th amendments of our constitution are obeyed surely it is more than time for congress to get down to business h r 627 proposes to do just that its primary purpose is to give the federal government more opportunity to deal with violators the bill accomplishes this end by providing for greater federal activity in the civil as opposed to the criminal courts the attorney general is given the power to bring civil suit for damages on behalf of an injured party against any person or persons who are guilty of a civilrights violation it also gives him authority to apply for an injunction in the courts whenever he has evidence that an individual or a group intends to abridge the rights or immunities of another if granted this order would stop a violation before it ever takes place furthermore the bill expressly states that these remedies may be sought by the attorney general in a federal district court before all state judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted to insure that the entire range of problems covered by civilrights enforcement will receive thorough and effective attention the bill provides for the creation of the post of assistant attorney general for civil rights in the department of justice it calls also for the creation of a sixman bipartisan commission in the executive branch of the government to study and investigate complaints of civilrights violations and to evaluate the policies now pursued by the federal government it is hoped that this commission will not only help clarify the complex issues we face in this area but that it will also help bring together men from all sections of the country and unite them in their efforts to solve this problem h r 627 is a good bill as far as it goes and i support it but in my opinion it does not go far enough it is laudable but limited eighty years of inaction and lost time can only be redeemed by stringent measures which provide for more vigorous criminal as well as civil enforcement i would have preferred the provisions of my omnibus civil rights bill h r 51 introduced by me into the house on january 5 1955 my bill would have taken a tougher and more realistic approach to the problem by extending the application not only of the civil but of the criminal provisions of the existing law under the present statutes conspiratorial action the acting together of two or more people is the only kind of action which can be punished by fine or imprisonment the bill now before the house does nothing to alter this limitation whereas my bill would have provided for the punishment of violators acting individually as well it recognized the elementary truth that man alone as well as in a pack can commit a crime against his fellow man my bill also stiffened and extended those provisions of the law which make interference with the free exercise of the franchise a federal crime it realized that the abridgment of the right to vote can take place in any election federal state or primary and that it can take place before the attempt to vote is ever made its provisions therefore guaranteed to all citizens otherwise eligible by law the equal opportunity to qualify to vote and to vote in any general special or primary election the bill before us leaves the criminal provisions untouched and covering only the right to vote in federal elections my bill by prohibiting segregation in interstate transportation also finished the business begun by the congress in 1875 i can only wish that these provisions were in the bill now before us my bill covered all necessary parts of ia comprehensive civil rights program including fepc antitioll tax and antilynching provisions there are other measures i think should be in the present bill i would like to see the establishment of aninvestigative body a joint committee on civil rights here in the congress where the responsibility for remedial action lies i would also like to see a bipartisan commission created in the executive branch to function not for 2 years only but as a continuing body to aid in overseeing the progress of the program we are establishing h r 627 does not do the whole job for us that can be done only by the vigilant action of every citizen in this country but it is a good and necessary start in spite of its limitations the

national academy of sciences in regard to the effects of radiation on the human body and mind i call it to your attention today because yesterday the senate passed s 4146 which proposes to go ahead and build unnecessary atomic power reactors despite the national academys solemn warning and despite the opposition of the atomic energy commission itself on last january 19 i spoke on the floor of this hcuse about the proposed reactor program i based my objections to federalized atomic power primarily on these two factors the disaster possibility and the very direct probability thatthrough the use of funds coming from the united states treasuryminers railroaders and other workingmen dependent upon a vigorous coal industry would find themselves in the position of trying to hold their jobs in the face of competition from this new bureaucratic monstrosity no one has come forth to challenge the first allegation nor have any attempts been made to deny the serious economic impact that the introduction of government atomic powerplants might have on coal and related industries but as regards the risk involved in the operation of the atomic power stations and in the disposal of atomic waste the situation has changed in the 6 month interim since i discussed this subject in the house my arguments have been substantiated by a number of events that have taken place within the last month first there is that report by the national academy of sciences which explains that rays given off by atoms can cause a deterioration of the human race marked by a higher death rate lowered birth rate and a lowered resistance to disease the national academy pointed out that radiation unless carefully controlled presents a grave threat to the generation exposed to it and to future generations as well on july 2 the united press reported two explosions of radioactive thorium in an atomic energy laboratory that endangered some 300 persons on july 5 international news service reported that dr ralph lapp a leading scientist warned that the world is a lot closer to the maximum safe level of radioactivity than was indicated in the national academys statement he said that education about the biological effects of nuclear radiation is an absolute prerequisite if the human race is to survive added up these opinions and news reports should serve as a red flag against proceeding without caution down the dangerous path that some of the reactor proponents have mapped out for us i want to make it clear that i feel the atomic energy commission itself should be absolved of the blame for the initiation of this program my understanding is that the chairman and most of his associates are opposed to the plan to set up reactors before proper tests have been made on an experimental scale nevertheless i am convinced that the idea for going ahead helterskelter with this program has been conceived and promoted by an organized gang within the commission i wonder whether some of those folks might not already have been exposed to a greater intensity of atomic radiation than is presumed to be the safe level on july 4 reuters news agency told of a psychiatrist in england who has come to the conclusion that radiation from atomic and hydrogen bomb tests is making our children brighter he is not too sure about this point however adding that it would be advisable not to discharge any more atomic bombs for the time being because he said you cannot do anything about the radioactive effect that safety qualification which the psychiatrist makes might appear to be somewhat contradictory actually though while he may feel that radiation has boosted child intelligence he is sufficiently humane to want our youngsters to stay alive long enough to become adults let me emphasize that i am not blaming the joint committee on atomic energy for the proposed legislation i feel that the committee has worked hard and has felt obliged to come up with a bill that would stimulate development of an electric power program the action of the senators who voted for the bill yesterday is also understandable in that there is an intense desire to carry out some sort of program that will guarantee united states leadership in the world atomic race it is my contention that we cannot afford to proceed with any such program at this time i am not referring alone to the 400 million involved in the bill i submit that we cannot afford to subject the human race to further exposure to atomic radiation until more is known about the problem i ask my colleagues that they do not permit the house to be stampeded into accepting this measure among the many bills that will no doubt be enacted in the closing days of the session"], [0.0008037090301513672, 0.5008037090301514, 1, "again i have to qualify the gentlemans question a mere announcement of disagreement with the supreme court decision is to my mind not enough it takes a regular official act of the legislature or an official proclamation of the governor or some regular act that of which a court of competent jurisdiction could take judicial notice rather than these things we would have to prove in a regular court proceeding i might say we would take judicial notice of the official election in virginia a referendum held under the laws of virginia by the regularly constituted voters of virginia that is a different kind of an act than a mere pronouncement that a state is or is not going to comply as i understand there is a resolution of interposition pending in the mississippi legislature the fact that a resolution was introduced or that some members of the legislature announced that they were going to introduce such a resolution would not to my mind justify the withholding of federal funds but if the legislature passes that resolution and it is enacted into law in a regularly constituted form and fashion then i say the only thing the federal government can do is to take cognizance of that official action and withhold funds"], [0.0008577406406402588, 0.49914225935935974, 0, "i wish to join my colleagues of the house in support of house concurrent resolution 149 offered by the gentleman from massachusetts our able and distinguished majority leader and to commend the gentleman for his timeliness in presenting it here house concurrent resolution 149 declares it to be the sense of the congress that the united states should administer its foreign policies and programs and should also exercise its influence in the united nations and other international organizations of which it may be a member so as to support other peoples in their efforts to achieve selfgovernment or independence under circumstances which will enable them to assume an equal station among the free nations of the world it is most fitting and timely that the house should adopt such a statement of policy at this time we have recently witnessed the afroasian conference at bandung indonesia where we learned to our pleasant surprise of the large number of friends we had among the nations of asia and africa friends who share our belief in the principles of democratic freedom and who were not afraid to stand up and be counted on our side in debate with the communist and neutralist countries of that part of the world our friends at bandung also correctly pointed out that communist imperialism is the most dangerous form at present of all forms of colonialism which constitute a denial of the inalienable rights of man since the united states has ever since the adoption of the declaration of independence traditionally supported other peoples in their aspirations to achieve selfgovernment or independence and in their struggle against tyranny or domination it is eminently correct that the house express itself in the sense of house concurrent resolution 149 at this time when the united nations is celebrating its 10th anniversary at san francisco such a time when we are nearing the socalled summit meeting of the big four at switzerland it is indeed more than ever essential that the elected representatives of the american people record themselves as reaffirming these principles which have been a traditional keystone of our foreign policy since the inception of our country i believe that the house should however go further in its implementation of such glorious principles yesterday the foreign affairs committee reported out h r 6922 better known as the mutual security act of 1955 i attempted in committee to secure the passage of an amendment which would have limited our military and economic assistance to those nations which likewise endorse the principles contained in house concurrent resolution 149 my amendment was defeated by the substitution of a watereddown version which merely stated that our mutualsecurity legislation should be administered in accordance with the sense of the resolution now under consideration i do not regard this as genuine or sufficient implementation by the house of the sense of house concurrent resolution 149 and i hereby serve notice that when h r 6922 comes up for consideration i shall reintroduce my original amendment which in effect provides that no country shall qualify for our foreign aid unless it too conform to the principles which we are espousing so enthusiastically here today i hope that the house will unanimously support house concurrent resolution 149 which i believe will prove of tremendous encouragement to peoples throughout the world who are struggling against foreign domination and for selfgovernment and independence that the united states is firmly on their side in their efforts and aspirations"]]}
