unitedstates history as part of a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a

political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new

went into somalia by order of president bush for two purposes to create a secure environment so that food could move to the people in somalia the president stated that very carefully in december then when the u n security council resolution 794 was adopted in december 1992 those purposes were restated and i use the words of the u n resolution now use force if necessary to secure the environment for humanitarian relief operations then after operation restore hope was ended and u n security council resolution 814 came into effect setting up unosom ii the united states role in somalia became more limited than it has been under operation restore hope it was limited in two specific ways we have withdrawn now 80 percent of our forces so we have had fewer forces under unosom ii than in operation restore hope we had 28 000 united states troops in somalia last december today that figure is about 5 000 but not only was there a limitation with respect to the numbers we also reduced our costs the united states was responsible for the entire cost under operation restore hope under unosom ii we were responsible only for the u n assessed rate and we are reimbursed for our logistic troop contribution i do not believe that the united states should be engaged in nation building in somalia that is the task of the united nations that is not the task of the united states the mission for the united states remains today exactly what it was when we went in to ensure a secure environment for humanitarian relief we have achieved the humanitarian relief there is no starvation today in somalia we have almost achieved the secure environment but not quite we have made a lot of progress in somalia no longer is there mass starvation in half of somalias 60 districts representative councils are functioning schools and hospitals are opening thousands of people have been spared from starvation and efforts are underway to rehabilitate the countrys police force and the prison system where do we go from here there is no doubt that we have got a difficult problem in the southern part of the capital city mogadishu and our goal should be to reduce and to eliminate the united states

the u n become successful at the business of peacekeeping so that we do not always have to go it alone in the world so that we do not have to be the worlds policeman in addition we have invested a large amount of capital and resources and indeed some lives in an effort to end the starvation and to provide some stability in that country if we pull out immediately anarchy will return swiftly and our past investment will be lost we should not sacrifice the substantial gains that have been made in the last 10 months i urge adoption of this amendment no one can deny that efforts to achieve progress in somalia under security council resolution 814 have been difficult this is the first u n led chapter vii enforcement action it is critical that it achieve success because t is in the unitedstates interest that the u n become successful at peacekeeping the united states cannot and should not be the worlds policeman at the end of operation restore hope the united states found itself in a difficult position without continued international involvement the gains achieved in somalia would be jeopardized the united nations was ready to assume precedentsetting control of the operation at the same time the u n acknowledged its need for continued strong unitedstates support and leadership to provide security for humanitarian relief our goal should be to reduce and eventually eliminate the united states military presence in somalia as the u n is able to assume greater control were moving in that direction we must continue to do so on the day president clinton took office there were 25 000 united states forces in somalia this number is now under 5 000 remaining united states forces in somalia should be withdrawn as expeditiously as possible there should be openended united states military commitment in somalia the objectives of the united states in somalia should be what they have always been to help to establish a secure environment so that humanitarian relief

understood that a terrible wrong had been committed and government has an obligation to attempt to make things right that simple understanding of justice holds equally true for the victims of secret government world war ii mustard and lewisite gas tests on unitedstates military personnel after nearly 50 years of denial and bureaucratic inaction in 1991 the government admitted its responsibility for conducting these secret tests without the full informed consent of its subjects federal agencies including tlie departments of veterans affairs and defense have finally begun to assist victims suffering from longterm health problerhs in fact just last week the department of veterans affairs under the leadership or secretary jesse brown issued proposed regulations to make good on its promise to help many of these veterans today there is a pretty clear picture of what happened to hundredsand possibly thousandsof men during world war ii at that time amid fears of an enemy chemical attack the unitedstates navy and likely the other armed services as well embarked on a program to test the effectiveness or protective clothing against impregnation by mustard gas and lewisite in gathering the needed subjects for these tests volunteers were solicited under the guise of testing summer clothing and with the attractive promise of extra weekend liberty passes once committed to the program these 17 and 18yearold trainees suddenly ceased to be volunteers they were fitted with gas masks and suits and ordered into gas chambers for repeated exposure to lethal gases documentation confirms that the tests went beyond studying the effectiveness of the clothing and masks and moved into a study of how much exposure a man could take the infamous manbreak test in many cases the protective equipment failed when these volunteers were no longer needed or when they were too sick to continue the men were sent back to their posts without proper medical followup they were sworn to secrecy and threatened with courts martial if they xevealed the true nature of their exposure to anyone even to their own physicians did this happen in america given the classified status of this test program the record keeping about who participated levels of exposure and injuries sustained is woefully incomplete and sometimes nonexistent after decades of silence and illness some ventured to speak out about what their government had done to them the lies the exposure the threats and the neglect when they sought redress and assistance for their medical problemsthey were rebuffed first came the denial then the stonewalling then the gee we wish we could help but according to va rules in order to receive compensation for a disability you had to show that the medical problem was the result of your service in the case of the mustard gas victims who had no paper trail for their plight this was practically impossible a tragic catch22 but a few persisted nat schnurman for one of richmond va armed only with his computer his telephone and his freedom of information rights as a unitedstates citizen he gathered enough boxes and boxes of records to prove that he and thousands of others had indeed been used as human guinea pigs finally after national media attention in 1991 the va began to change the rules and commissioned a longterm study into health problems associated with exposure to lethal gases in 1993 with the release of that study the e h97 department of defense officially released all participants of these tests from their oath of secrecy now we are in the final stages of bringing help to those who have waited so long in my office we have heard from hundreds of men and their families from around the country they all tell similar tales of lies deception and betrayal they need medical help they want recognition they deserve respect and gratitude once we ensure that they have access to the medical care they have earned we have one more mission to completeand that is to provide them with an official commendation for their service already more than 50 of my colleagues have joined in cosponsoring h r 1055 legislation to do just that i urge all members to sign onto this effort so we

that are intended to strengthen our international efforts to protect endangered species the illegal trade in endangered species is increasingly threatening tigers rhinos and other species particularly in asia this initiative which i offered in the appropriations committee draws public attention to these conditions and creates a voluntary donation program associated with the endangered species exhibits at the national zoo in washington dc the unitedstates fish and wildlife service and the smithsonian institution would jointly sponsor this program the goal of the donation program is to supplement funding for usfws education and law enforcement programs that combat poaching and trading of endangered species the increasing demand for tiger and rhino parts to produce tradtiional medicines has placed terrific pressure on these species without improved efforts to protect them tigers and rhinos will be faced with certain extinction with 3 million visitors each year the national

illegal poaching and trading budget constraints have prevented a direct appropriation for these efforts as an altemative this voluntary donation program will give zoo visitors an immediate avenue to
