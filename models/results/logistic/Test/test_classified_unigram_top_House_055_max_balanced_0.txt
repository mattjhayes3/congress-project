with our home manufacturers placing as it does the american people once more at the mercy of trusts and combines the offspring of protectiona measure that finds no warrant in the constitution the democratic party denies the right and power of congress to levy a tariff for protection we deny the justice or right to tax or destroy by a prohibitory tariff the right of free trade it is a natural right a property right belonging to the people alone subject to a tax for revenue as all other property 1897 may be to prohibit or destroy by a tariff tax the free exercise of this right to create encourage or protect other industries and especially manufacturers is in the language of judge cooley tyrannical and unjust mr seward secretary of state under president lincoln in favoring a tariff lower than that of 1846 said every dollar legislated out of the pockets of the people beyond the wants of the government is legal robbery mr sherman in 1868 said every advance toward a free exchange of commodities is an advance in civilization every obstruction to a free exchange is born of the same narrow despotic spirit which planted castles upon the rhine to plunder peaceful commerce every obstruction to commerce is a tax upon consumption every tacility to a free exchange cheapens commodities increases trade and popu lation and promotes civilization the republicans claim that a high tariff builds up manufactures which in turn build up cities and improve the possibilities of the people and community this is called an incidental benefit judge cooley on this position says the incidental benefit which any enterprise may bring to the public has never been recognized as sufficient to bring the object within the sphere of taxation therefore the enhancement of values which may or may not occur is not sufficient consideration to tax one man to build up another mans private business again he says in people vs salem 20 mich but it is not in the power of a state in my opinion under the name of bounty or any other cover or subterfuge to furnish the capital to set private enterprises up in any kind of business after they have entered upon it a bounty law of which this is the real nature is void whatever may be the pretense on which it may be enacted the right to hold out pecuniary inducements to the faithful performance of public duty in dangerous or responsible positions stands upon a different footing altogether nor havei any occasion to question the right to pay reward for the destruction of wild beasts and other public pests a provision of this character being a mere police regulation but the discrimination by the state between different characters of occupation and the favoring of one at the expense of the rest whether that one be farming or banking merchandising or milling printing or railroading is not legitimate legislation and is an invasion of that equality of right and privilege which is a maxim in state government when the door is once opueed to it there is no line at which we can stop and say with confidence that thus far we may go with safety and propriety but no further every honest employment is honorable it is beneficial to the public it deserves encouragement the more successful we can iake it the more does it generally gubserve the public good but it is not the business of the state to make discriminations in favor of one class against another or in favor of one employment against another the state can have no favorites its business is to protect the interests of all and give all the benefit of equal laws it can not compel an unwilling minority to submit to taxation in order that it may keep upon its feet any business that can not stand alone moreever it is not a weak interest only that can give plausible reason for public aid when the state once enters upon the business of subsidy we shall not fail to discover that the strong and powerful interests are those most likely to control legislation and that the weaker will be taxed to enhance the profits of the stronger this language from a great lawyer a great judge familiar with the constitution and the spirit of our institutions reminds me of the language employed by the hero of the hermitage whose every aim and sentiment was his countrys his gods and truths he said the corporations and wealthy individuals who are engaged in large manufacturing establishments desire a high tariff to increase their gains designing politicians will support it to conciliate their favor and to obtain the means of profuse expenditure for thepurpose of purchasing influence in other quarters do not allow yourselves my fellowcitizens to be misled on this subject the federal government can not collect a surplus for such urposes without violating the principles of the constitution and assuming ower which has not been granted it is moreover a system of injustice and if persisted in will lead to corruption and must end in ruin thus this great lover of the plain people spoke in his farewell address judge cooley says constitutionally a tax can have no other basis than the raising of revenue for public purposes and whatever government exaction has not this basis es tyrannical and unlawful a tax on imports therefore the purpose of which is not to raise revenue but to discourage and indirectly prohibit some particular import for the benefit of some home manufacturer may well be questioned as being colorable and therefore not warranted by constitutional principles note well gentlemen of the house that this distinguished lawyer jurist and writer in describing the duties levied on imports uses this laiguage a tax on imports the supreme court of michigan through chief justice campbell in the salem case without mincing words said taxation for private purposes is no more legal than robbery for private purposes and where an enter prise is conducted by private persons for their own private benefit the public authorities having no control over the ex endlture and no share in the profits it is a private enterprise and not a pubie one the republican party claims that they have a right to enact a tariff so high as to tax out or bar importations that would otherwise come to this country not only providing our people with cheap food and raiment but beating down trusts and combines that arise from prohibitory tariffs i beg to call the attention of the gentleman from new york to what the supreme court of that state said setting on foot any business or industry in a community tends indirectly to the benefit of every citizen by the increase of greater business activity the greater facility of obtaining employment the consequent in trease of population the enhancement in value of real estate and its readies sale and the multiplication of conveniences but these are not the direct and immediate public uses and purpose to which money taken by tax may be directed 64 n y 103 weismer vs douglas justice gray speaking for the unanimous court in 113 united states page 1 cole vs la grange said the general grant of legislative power in the constitution of a state does not enable the legislature in the exercise either of the right of eminent domain or of the right of taxation to take private property without the owners consent for any but a public object nor can the legislature authorize counties cities or towns to contract for private objects debts which must be paid by taxes it can not therefore authorize them to issue bonds to assist merchants or manufacturers whether natural persons or corporations in their private business these limits of the legislative power are now too firmly established by judicial decisions to require extended argument upon the subject continuing this democratic doctrine resting as you see on the constitution this distinguished judge from the great state of massachusetts said the taking of private property by taxation is subject to the same limit as the taking by the right of eminent domain each is a taking by the state for the public use and not to promote private ends when property by eminent domain is taken for public use just compensation must be paid this clerly presupposes that private property can not be taken for private purposes this case approves the new york case again this same high court reaffirmed the democratic doctrine saying to lay with one hand the power of the government on the property of the citizen and with the other b stow it upon favored individuals to aid pri rate enterprises and build up private fortunes is none the less a robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation 20 wallace 661 the court had previously in the same case said the power to tax is the strongest the most pervading of all the powes of the government reaching directly or indirectly to all classes of the people it was said by mr chief justice marshall in the case of mcculloch vs maryland that the power to tax is the power to destroy this power can as readily be employed against one class of individuals and in favor of another so as to ruin the on class and give unlimited wealth and prosperity to the other if there is no implied limitation of the uses for which the pcwer may be exercised the supreme court of the state of maine has spoken out in no uncertain sound in favo r of this andrew jackson democracy the issuance of bonds to aid local enterprises was asked for and the constitutionality of such a law being doubted the legislature of maine under the stae constitution submitted the question to the judges of the supreme court the unanimous opinion of that court was that such a law would be unconstitutional the judges giving their opinions separately the exact question submitted was has the legislature authority under the constitution to ipass laws enabling towns by gifts of money or loans of bonds to assist individuals or corporations to establish or carry on manufacturing of various kinds within or without the limits of said town 58 maine reports appendix page 590 justice dickinson sai6 the argument in support of the constitutionality of such a law is thait the establishment of the business of manufacturing in a town or city promotes the public prosperity by increasing the value of privateproperty inviting in capital and population and furnishing employment for the people the direct purpose of the propo3ed law is thus private in its character it is to increase the means and improve the property of some and furnish employment to some while the benefit if any to the public is only reflective incidental and secondary what claim has manufacturing to such preference over other branches of industry commerce trade agriculture and the mechanic arts these are honorable and beneficial pursuits and the constitution of this state will be searched in vain for any powers given to the legislature to authorize towns and cities to discriminate against these employments and in favor of manufacturing in the matter of taxation mr justice barrows in the same case says it is against common right and beyond the legitimate sphere of legislation to raise under color of taxation any sums of money except those which are required to perform the proper object for which the government was iastituted is it i submit a proper object for which this government was instituted for the government to engage in the business itself of manufacturing has tlle government ever undertaken to engage in private manufacturing oi any such purpose have we not over a hundred years of this governments existence and history to prove that such are not proper objects for it to engage in if the government has such right whence cometh it if on the other hand the government has no such right can it grant to indiv duals and corporations what it does not itself possess is it right and just to permit the passage of a law under the guise of a revenue measure when the primary and real purpose of such measure is to have the general government do indirectly what it can not do directly nor has ever undertaken to do i submit as evidence that it has no such power if manufacturing enterprises and other businesses rise up as the incidental effect or result of the legitimate workings of the general government under constitutional laws no objections should arise unless such growth corrupts the good morals or is contrary to the interest of society or to public policy if they do arise they can be swept out of existence or restrained under what is known as the police regulation this bill is ostensibly to provide revenue to the government and to encourage the industries of the united states this is its title in other words the republican party to carry out its pledge made with the rich corporations and aggregated wealth of 326 this country that have placed it again in power is trying to enact a law so framed as to do indirectly for their industries what the highest courts of the state and nation have repeatedly said can pot be done directlythat is enact laws which tax the people to build up and encourage private enterprises in the same case chief justice appleton and judges danforth and walton had already said now the individual or corporation manufacturing will in the outset promise to be and in the result will be either a judicious and gainful undertaklag oran injudiciousand losing one if the manufacturing be gainful there seems to be no public purpose to be accomplished by assessing a tax on reluctant citizens and coercing its collection to swell the gains of successful enterprise if the business be a losing one it is not readily perceived what public or golernmental purpose is attained by taxing those who would have reeived no share of the profits to pay for the loss of an unprosperous manufacture whether arising from folly incapacity or otherwise the taxpayer should not be compelled to pay for the loss when he is denied a share of the profits such a law may be for the benefit of the donee but it can not be for that of the people grant this power to the legislature and let it be exorcised and all security for property is at an end the motive to acquire is destroyed the power to protect is gone and what claim has manufacturing to such preference over other branches of industry commerce trade agriculture and the mechanic arts these are honorable and beneficial pursuits and the constitution of this state will be searched in vain to find any power given to the legislature to authorize towns and cities to discriminate against these employments and in favor of manufacturers in the matter of taxation this court further says there is nothing of a public nature any more entitling the manufacturer ito public gifts than the sailor the mechanic the lumberman or the farmer our government is based on equality of rights all honest employments are honorable the state can not rightfully discriminate among occupations or a discrimination in favor of one branch of industry is a discrimination adverse to all other branches the state is equally to protect all giving no indue advantages or special or exclusive preferences to any no public exigency can require private spoliation for the private benefits of avored individuals if the citizen is protected in his property by the con stitution against public much more is he against private rapacity i quote again from judge barrows doubtless the specious but deceptive claim of their advocates will be that rthey tend to promote the common welfare but to know for a certainty that that claim can not be allowed we have onlyto look at the definition of the word common when used in such connection i belonging to the public having no separate owner general serving for the use of all universal belonging to all websters dictioaury in defining this word mr anderson says originating with or substituting for the people at large belonging to or affecting the public not private but public or general andersons law idictionary continuing judge barrows said it is to promote the common welfare as thus defined that you have authorfty to legislate and to raise money by taxation and you can confer upon towns no delegated authority exceeding this in fine it is a principle that les at the very foundation of all legitimate exercise of the power of taxation that the revenue shall be raised for public purposes alone and not for private profit and advantage this alone makes the distinction between lawful taxation and public plunder but the subtle and sophistical argument of those who are seeking their own private advantage by the use of the public purse is that the successful establishment of a manufacturing business though the profits inure to private individuals or corporations is indirectly a benefit to the community but this is not an answer it is simply a pretext for an vasion of the fundamental principles above stated 1 now quote from judge tapley these inquiries do not leave my mind entirely clear as to the information ought by them if they relate to purelyprivate enterprises in no wise onieoted with pulc uses or the puble exigencies i answer without hesitation inthenogatie this conclusion is so clear to my mind and so free from all doubt that i can hardly persuade myself that the house of representati es ieally needed or desired the opinion of anyone upon the subject haxes should be imposed or leved for those purposes which properly constiute the public burden they are levied to secure the performance of publc duty or relieve public necessity but nevertheless in the face of this able opinion the opinion of nine judges the legislature of maine passed this unlawful measure we hear of it next where it should be in the supreme bourt of the state the first opinion was reported in 58 maine nd the next in 60 mainea quick trip an evidence of how indig nant the people of maine may become when in the forms of law they are about to be plundered there they had a square chance 1to test the law and did so in the bill now at issue the unconstitutionality of the law is disguised in the garb of a revenue neasure the act was construed in allen vs inhdbitants of jay a case in which a bounty on bonds issued to establish a saw and grist mill was attempted the court said a tax is a sum of money assessed under the authority of the state on the person or property of an individual for the use of the state taxation by the very meaning of the term implies the raising of money for public uses land excludes the raising of it for private objects and purposes i the idea seems to be that thereby capital would be created but such is not the case capital is the savings of past earnings ready for productive employment the bonds of a town may enable the holder to obtain money 1by their transfer as he might do by that of any other good note but no capital is thereby created it is only a transfer of capital from one kind of business to another nor is capital created by the raising of money by taxation if the wealth of the country was increased by taxation the result would be the higher the taxes the more rapid the increase of its wealth but the reverse is the case on page 130 the court said i our government is based on equality of right the state can not discriminate among occupations for a discrimination in favor of one is a discrimination adverse to all others while the state is bound to protect all it ceases to give that just protection when it affords undue advantages or gives special and exclusive preferences to particular individuals and particular and special industries at the cost and charge of the rest of the community unless there is something peculiar and transcendental in the new sawmill to be removed and in the gristmill to be erectedand in the labor of mlessrs hutchins lane it must stand in the same category with other sawmills and gristmills which are and have been and will be built and other laborious industries which are pursued for private gain and emolument again on pages 132 and 133 the court said whether the estates of citizens are to be placed in the public treasury for the pmopose of dividing them or of loaning them to those who have not accumulated them matters not in either case the owner is despoiled of his estate and his savings are confiscated if the loan be made to one or more for a particular object it is favoritism it is a discrimination in favor of the particular individual and a particular indu itry thereby aided and is one adverse to and against all individuals all industries not aided if it is to be loaned to all then it is practically a division of property under the name of a loan it is communism incipient if not perfected i now quote from the supreme court of pennsylvania the home of a member mr dalzell who aids in reporting this bill in 21 pennsylvania state reports page 168 the court said neither has the legislature any constitutional right to create a public debt nor to lay a tax nor to authorize any municipal corporation to do it in order to raise funds for a mere private purpose no such authority passed to the assembly by the general grant of legislative power this would not be legislation taxation is a mode of raising revenue for public purposes when it is prostituted to objects in no way connected with the public interests or welfare it ceases to be taxation and1 becomes plunder transferring money from the owners of it into the possession of those who have no title to it though it be done under the name and form of a tax is unconstitutional for all the reasons which forbid the legislature to usurp any other power not granted to them but it has been argued and here perhaps is the strain of the case that this will be taxation for a private purpose because the money levied will be in effect handed over to a private corporation i have conceded that a law authorizing taxation for any other than public purposes is void and it can not be denied that a railroad company is a private corporation in 58 california reports page 639 in the case of people vs parks the court said to promote a public purpose by a tax levy upon the property in the state is within the power of the legislature but the legislature has no power to impose taxes for the benefit of individuals connected with a private enterprise even though the private enterprise might benefit the local ublic in a remote or collateral way legislative power of taxation is not illimitable it can be used only in aid of a public objectan object which is within the purpose for which governments are established in the vigorous language of the supreme court of pennsylvania the legislature has no constitutional right to levya tax or to authorize a municipal corporation to do it the legislature has no constitutional right to levy a tax or to authorize any municipal corporation to do it in order to raise funds for a mere private purpose i now quote from the supreme court of the state from which our eloquent friend mr dolliver hailsin 27 iowa pages 46 and 47 the court said what are taxes this is the question which lies at the heart of the present case i answer that by the concurrent opiiion of lawyers judges lexicographers and political economists as well as by the general and popular understanding taxes are burdens or charges imposed by the legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes or to accomplish some governmental end a tax for a private purpose is to use the strong yet apt expression of lowe j in the wapello county case 13 iowa 405 a solecism in language in 24 wisconsin page 356 the court says it is conceded by all that a tax must be for a public and not for a private purpose if therefore the legislature attempts to take money from the people by legal compulsion for a merely private purpose that is not a tax according to the essential meaning of the word and therefore such a law is not strictly speaking unconstitutional as being prohibited by any positive provision of the constitution but is void for the reason that it is beyond the scope of legislation such is the law in my own state tennessee but i here most desired to show the distinguished republicans from maine new york pennsylvania michigan iowa and wisconsin who support this bill how they are slapping in the face the opinions of their respective supreme courts"], [0.054582465440034866, 0.054582465440034866, 0, "i call up for present consideration the bill to provide for the erection of a public building at

of war against spain for more than twelve long months i am now in favor of the prosecution of that war without delay without a single days hesitation to the bitterest end and to the final grand victory recognizing the fact that war exists that we are face to face with the grave problem of providing for the raising of revenues to carry on this war i say with full consciousness of the meaning of my words that i but voice the sentiments of my constituents only utter the unanimous purpose and desire of every democratic member of this house when i speak my own convictions and express the fact that while i deplore the necessity for the immeasurable agony the incalculable destruction the infinite woe of war yet better far that this war should come though at the cost of untold treasure of countless wealth and human life than the degradation of our countrys honor better all this sacrifice and misery than that we should fail to maintain our countrys flag that it may ever float aloft the starry banner of freedom the hope of humanity so we stand today and all through the weeks past as the days have come and gone each pregnant with hope deferredwe have been ever ready willing and anxious to stand by our flag maintain its honor and protect its credit we are in favor of furnishing every dollar of revenue that is necessary to prosecute this war not merely because of our hearts prompting our countrys cause right or wrong but because we believe its cause to be right and just i beg to say in all candor and with all kindness that we have been pleading with you gentlemen on the republican side for months striving to arouse you from your lethargy and slumber trying to induce you to action and now that at last with laggard step it is true you have come over on our side and joined us in our patriotic demands we have no hesitancy in joining as one man with you in securing and providing the revenue necessary for the maintenance of a vigorous defense but when we come to the discussion of the means whereby this revenue is to be raised we come to a parting of our ways even for the sake and pleasure of inflicting just punishment upon spain we can not consent to do that which will drain the sources of industry in our land and seize the workingmans tools the farmers plow we seek to defend the peoples rights not to oppose a just war in the recognition of the duty imposed upon us by our solemn oath of office in obedience to our conception of the constitutional trust resting upon us in the furtherance of the ancient principle that laws are made to guard the rights of the people not to feed the few we can not join without protest in the methods proposed in this bill to provide ways and means for war expenditures we do not protest without pointing out a better plan we do not object to this bill for the purpose of delay or raising futile objections no we are standing on the bed rock ot principle and contend that there is a better way a way by which this revenue may be raised without bearing down harder upon those who will have to face increased tasks with decreased cheer we stand in behalf of the great mass of the people the many as against the few for years the policy of this government has been along the line of legislation tending to build up vast fortunes for the protected few at the expense of the many for years the many and the poorer have borne the burdens that the few might prosper i am not an alarmist when i repeat the trite saying that the rich have grown richer and the poor poorer in these later years as the result of legislation influenced by just such interests as are back of and directing the revenue measures of this administration the same interests that have had more to do with the procrastinating policy of the administration in treating the war question than all others it is the syndicate and trust whose agents have been in the high counsels of state to the exclusion of the common people and now they propose that not only shall these noblest citizens of our land the common people representing not the moneyed wealth but the brain and the brawn coming from the farm and the workshop the office and the store these shall not only give their bodies as a living fortress to shield and maintain their country but shall also first feel the weight and bear the financial brunt of the burden of taxation for national defense we say that these things ought not so to be we stand here to plead for our countrys honor not only upon the battlefield but in the home and around the hearthstone of its humblest citizen the great mass of the people are honest and patriotic they favor the vigorous prosecution of this war and are ready to bear their share of the expense of the same even while they ask the reason why but the spirit of justice still dwells within their breasts and they ask that they be not compelled to make bricks without straw the gentlemen of the majority have decried partisanship and yet they are wholly partisan in their advocacy of this bill we are taunted with certain defeat but sir in warning my country of its peril i would rather lack success than fidelity our patriotism is assailed through their own perverted vision they see things falsely they paint manly courage and patriotic zeal as great blunders and dark shame their colors deepening and darkening as farther they stray from the fountain of truth we are charged with unamericanism let me say that no mar living on this continent under the flag of america anywhere under the arched vault of heaven holds in his heart a greater love of his country is truer to his flag than i no one is more deeply in earnest or more concerned than i am on this particular question in my home are heavy hearts and there are those who look with deep unfaltering anxiety toward the place where danger is thickest where there is one for whom i would give my life to save from suffering and death it comes with ill grace from that side of the house to make such chargesyou who have delayed to declare in favor of the suffering patriots of cuba you who would defeat the recognition of what they are so justly entitled to their independence you who would also fasten the chains of financial slavery and serfdom upon your own fellowcountrymen i say again that it ill befits you to make such false and despicable assertions against this side patriotic tonight you are yes patriotic today your flag is flying high your uniform is bright and your cheer is loud but less than three weeks ago what position did you occupy on this question how were we to find you or astertain what your position was then you were in dark gloom of deep cellars then you were in wall street consulting with bankers and brokers the men whose interests were money and money only not manhood principle and patriotism you were making the dignity honor and manhood of the country subordinate to the dictates of a foreign money power we as a government have practically declared against privateering we do not allow an individual a private company a corporation or a syndicate to make war upon or attack the common enemy even in times of war and yet in time of war and in time of peace this government permits attacks upon its own people by monopolies and bond trusts more direful in their results than the warfare of privateers there is something more dangerous to our peace and to our interest than the menaces of spain who fears spain on this continent there is no one who has the courage and decency of american citizenship who believes that the united states is in danger from spain but lurking in the bill you present to us is an insidious peril involving greater harm to american interests than could come from spain if this war should perchance last a dozen years there is as much of spanish inhumanity connected with this bill as ever existed in the island of cuba and it strikes at the laboring man and the poor people of these united states we are seeking to amend this bill to strive to cut off the excrescences that are within it you count upon the heat of battle and the enthusiasm of patriotism to fasten fetters upon our people none of us grudges the funds necessary to fit out our ships and man the guns but we do resist this attempt to invade the peoples rights and though we fail we fail doing our duty to ourselves our constituents and our country you may succeed in passing this bill here you may fasten this grievous and pernicious system upon the people the true blues whipped into line kiss the rod that smites them while whining under the lash and pledge the tears in their eyes that they will obey their master so a bound party you promise the money holders to levy an imposition upon the people that they may prosper but you mistake the temper of the people and in november will come back their reply as we voice it today millions for defense but not one cent for tribute either to foreign princes or domestic syndicates how brave how grand how glorious is this system you seek to perpetuate a system under the provisions of which a poor widow who should enter a drug store to purchase a bottle of medicine to save the life of her sick child receives this proprietary medicine worth 30 cents on this you levy a tax of 2 cents while in the arlington you sit with your committee on ways and means with the arbuckles the bankers and the money changers drinking champagne on which you pay 4 cents a quart thou shalt not remove the ancient landmarks says the book but that is what you are doing the lifeblood of the nation has been drawn from its veins the circulating medium has been reduced to provide revenue to carry on this war by bond issue even if by popular subscription and placed in every postoffice in the land would be an assault upon the best and dearest good of our land it would result in the still further contraction of our currency by the withdrawal of capital from the channels of production prices and wages would fall and profits lessen to the manifest discouragement of industry the real true patriotic course is to put money into the channels and avenues of business and trade thus increase the circulation infuse life into industrial pursuits and by so doing quicken the heart throbs of national existence and prevent war from bringing stagnation and death to commercial and economic interests we plead that the burden of this expense for the conduct of the war be not placed upon the laboring people of our country alone let the wealthy of the nation bear their share why should they be exempt what divinity is there that surrounds and hedges them about that the constitution and the courts are ever invoked to protect them whenever it is suggested that they should even in a slight measure contribute to the nations sustenance it seems very easyso easy indeed that in a single night a bill may be brought forth full fledged able to withstand the assaults of the ablest and most learned attorneys of the united states that bears within its provisions the taxation of the poor but why is it that after months of careful deliberation counsel and thought a bill can not be framed to tax the income of the rich what is the mysterious power and influence that stays legislation in in this direction ah you fear the income tax it isopposed to your interests it reaches into the pockets of the corporations the syndicates and trusts and through them it reaches you their beneficiaries after a century of judicial history with decision after decision maintaining and upholding the legitimacy of the income tax at last by a most suspicious combination of circumstances by the most violent subversion of precedent reason and logic the law providing for it was declared unconstitutional we eliminate the features of the law which by the dictum of a majority of one the supreme court say s dunconstitutional and submit it to you not one among you dare face the issue not one is willing to try his lance in debate upon the merits of this amendment which we proposea right to tax the rich as well as the poor to reach the dia monds of the wealthy as well as the tin pail of the workingman to impose a burden upon the champagne of the shylock as well as upon the beer and tobacco of the people this you meet with sneers and cry let us be manly let us issue bonds i listened to the gentleman from iowa with rapt attention as he so eloquently and ably defended and championed the president of the united states seldom has there been a more glowing and impassioned eulogium pronounced than that uttered by the able member from iowa and yet how this president has been hampered and delayed and turned aside from the execution of the great purposes of his heart by the counsels of those by whom he has been surrounded members of the republican party representatives not of the people but of syndicates and trusts i need not here express my admiration of the personality of the president nor pronounce my respect for the high offic he fills on this floor and elsewhere i have ever uttered my appreciation of his inherent patriotism and good intentions but sir it has not been william mckinley the man and patriot that has spoken it has not been in the exercise of his free will as president that the administration has acted if it had been long ere this the world would have resounded with his praise his name would have been spoken with blessing by every child of humanity in whose heart there lingered a spark of the spirit of liberty and humanity and down through the long ages forever would his name be joined with washington and lincoln in an immortal triumvirate this has not been the case a year ago he might have spoken and cuba would have been free we would not have offered the unnecessary sacrifice of the maine and there would have been no war but the mighty influence of the money power kept him silent then and has kept him silent until the mightier influence of an outraged and aroused patriotic public sentiment compelled him to voice its desires you glory today that the president has never moved until necessity compelled what necessity the necessity of outraged public opinion you yourselves sat silent in your seats more than that you even throttled free speech in the defense of cuba upon this floor month after month and you never became patriotic until you felt your seats shaking beneath you as the result of the indignation of your constituents that sir is the naked unvarnished truth i fully agree with the gentleman from iowa when he says good sense demands that we take care of the liabilities we now have instead of increasing them we must meet this question face to face and meet it in aspirit of true patriotism as well as financial wisdom with the unconstitutional features pointed out by the united states supreme court eliminated by exempting income derived from state county municipal and schooldistrict bonds there could be derived from an income tax not less than 100 000 000 a year the last official figures obtainable as to the total amount of the bonds named were those of the census report in 1890 at that time they amounted to 1 135 210 442 the interest upon them amounted to 45 408 417 onethird of these were held abroad leaving the income derived from them by american citizens about 30 000 000 the united states has a little more than doubled its population since the last income tax was in operation while the large incomes have been quadrupled the largest amount received under the old income tax was in 1866 when 73 434 709 12 was realized with double the population and the vast increase in the large incomes exempting the comparatively small amount received from state and municipal bonds the total could scarcely be less than 100 000 000 which would probably be sufficient to cover the defects of the dingley bill as a revenue producer it is a wellknown fact that the incomes in the united states are larger than those in any other country while the population is much greater than that of the united kingdom france or italy last year the united kingdom derived from income taxation 74 914 215 france derived 44 498 922 italy derived 57 332 260 mr holmes one of the bestknown statisticians of this country estimates the wealth of the united states at 50 00 000 000 and the number of families at 12 690 153 of these 11 593 887 families own 42 643 163 657 nine per cent of the families own 71 per cent of the wealth families to the number of 4 047 possess 70 per cent as much as do 11 593 887 families mr sherman says the facts conclusively demonstrate that the wealthiest class in the united states is vastly richer than the wealthiest class in great britain the average annual income of the hundred richest americans can not be less than 1 200 000 and probably exceeds 1 500 000 he divides the classes as rich 182 090 families wealth 48 367 000 000 middle 7 500 000 000 working 11 215 000 000 the united states are practically owned by onesixtieth of its population it is well known that the class of people designated by mr sherman as middle and working while owning less than 30 per cent of the wealth of the nation contribute more than 80 per cent toward the payment of the expenses of the government the republicans are proud of pointing to their record of 1890 1891 and 1892 and yet they now having turned right about face want us to pursue exactly the opposite financial course from that of the government during those years of prosperity the present debt bearing no interest which includes united states notes old demand notes nationalbank notes and fractional currency amounts at this time to 386 974 069 64 in 1890 the noninterestbearing debt amounted to 825 011 289 47 in 1891 it was 933 852 766 35 in 1892 it was 1 000 648 939 37 the interestbearing debt is now 847 366 680 in 1890 it was 725 313 110 in 1891 it was 610 529 120 in 1892 it was 585 029 330 the interestbearing debt has been increased since 1892 262 337 350 the noninterestbearing debt has been decreased during the same period 613 674 869 73 and now we are asked to still further increase the interestbearing debt if the republicans were willing to simply go back to the condition of 1892 we would pay 262 000 000 of the interestbearing debt and increase the surplus in the treasury without a dollar of bonds or a dollar of increased taxation by 351 000 000 or if they did not pay off the 262 000 000 interestbearing debt they would by simply expanding the currency to the condition it was in 1892 place a surplus in the treasury of 613 000 000 we have been constantly contracting the noninterestbearing debt and expanding the interestbearing debt there was in the treasury on april 21 an available cash balance of 220 479 165 the cash in the treasury july 1 1861 at the time of our last war was only 2 862 212 92 in 1862 it was only 18 863 6 59 90 in 1863 it was only 8 421 4 01 22 the financiers of that period were not frightened and yet now when there is 220 000 000 in the treasury we are in a panic to raise more revenue and are asked to issue bonds in 1865 our total indebtedness less cash in the treasury was 2 674 815 856 76 at the same time the cash in the treasury on july 1 was only 5 832 012 98 we were not considered bankrupt and our bonds were good security at present our total interest and noninterestbearing debt is only 1 235 668 419 or less than half what it was in 1865 while our cash balance is 220 000 000 or fortyfive times as much as it was then and yet it is said that we are confronted with a great financial problem that can only be solved by the issuance of bonds on april 26 1898 silver was quoted in london at 26g pence exchange in new york 4 85 equivalent value of a fine ounce of silver 0 56938 bullion value of the united states silver dollars 0 46121 there was of silver bullion on hand april 1 109 864 545 41 ounces which cost 99 349 752 77 the coinage value of this sil ver is 142 047 088 99 the profit for seigniorage would be 42 697 336 22 there is cash in the treasury 220 479 165 i am aware that this statement does not agree with the figures presented by the gentleman from maine who says there is but 65 000 000 available for all purposes in the treasury and from that most be taken the 50 000 000 appropriation of the 9th of march we are told by those on the floor of this house who ought to know that the greater part of this 50 000 000 has already been expended in the purchase of boats equipments and munitions of war yet the report of the secretary of the treasury informs us that the treasurys total available cash balance is 220 479 165 only the slight difference of 205 479 165 from the statement of the member from maine the chairman of the committee on ways and means goes further and with parental solicitude says that the tariff act of july 24 1897 has placed the country in a position if peace conditions had continued where the revenues would have been equal to and in a short time in excess of the expenditures what are the facts the treasury reports show that the deficiency for the fiscal year of 1896 was 25 586 455 for 1897 41 171 562 and for 1898 6 031 019 it also shows that there is included in the receipts for 1898 the sum of 58 204 823 on account of cash received from sale of the union pacific railroad this amount having absolutely no connection whatever with the tariff act of july 24 1897 conclusively proving that that act the notorious dingley bill is responsible for a deficiency of 64 235 842 an increase of 23 064 280 in ten months as against 15 585 107 during the last year of the operation of the wilson bill under the uncertainties and depressing influences of tariff legislation i have more faith than has the ways and means committee in the efficiency of this revenue bill if a constitutional income tax is added to it they must believe that they have presented to this congress a bill that will prove even a greater failure as a revenue producer than the dingley law for with the vast amount now in the treasury they would not want to issue bonds unless they believed their bill would produce a great deficiency instead of raising the revenue necessary for the ordinary expenses of the government we have ample funds with which to provide for the extraordinary expenses and if in the judgment of the ways and means committee the bill they have presented will not provide for the ordinary expenses they should take it back into the committee room and bring us another one that will provide for those expenses if the bill will raise sufficient revenue there is no need for bonds and if it will not it should lie amended so that it will it is based upon the measure that was passed to provide for the expenses of the last war and with double the population and four times the volume of business and a war the nature of which precludes the possibility of its being as expensive as the last war and a nation that is united instead of divided it would seem to be comparatively a very easy matter to provide for this war with the money now in the treasury the profit from the coinage of the seigniorage and the receipts from the income tax we would have over 300 000 000 now to this amount almost by the single stroke of the pen you can add millions more without for one instant jeopardizing the true interests of this country without entering with ruthless step the homes of the poor without robbing the husbandman on the farm without doing injustice to any man woman or child this you can do by allowing the issue of greenbacks the greenback saved the nation once even when you dishonored it let not your humanity and justice your patriotism and honor be subordinated to your greed issue 50 000 000 of greenbacks and send them forth on their mission start the troops on their march through cuba command the cannon to speak batter down the walls of morro castle and lest we forget lest we forget avenge the maine you say that this would bring on an inflated condition of the currency what utter nonsense what absolute folly to make such a charge make the greenback a full legal tender for the payment of all debts public and private and they would be but a stimulus in the veins of commere and trade that which is needed by the business of the nation at this time make an issue of one hundred or two hundred millions of greenbacks and the nation will applaud you make it a hundred thousand dollars of interestbearing bonds and from the workshop and the farm from the valley and the plain ninetenths of the american people will forever condemn you the voice of the money shark and lender is heard through their mouthpiece on this floor as he says let us say that we will pay interest that is the secret the inspiration of the support of this clause providing for bonds from the inner chambers of the bankers and brokers comes the message we must have our interest the shylocks pound of fleshand in response to the dictation of their masters the bonds are provided we denounce as false and wholly untrue the charge that this side of the house is opposed to the enactment of wise legislation necessary to raise the money to prosecute this war we are ready to support any wise legislation but we are opposed to any legislation that places shackles upon the people and forces their contribution to the support of the government into the coffers of syndicates and trusts you say necessity drives yes but it drives in the direction where the devil leads in this case there is no necessity for the issuing of thesebonds now let this issue of greenbacks be made and the people will take them the patriotism and the honor of the nation will protect them even granting that which i do not admit that the issue might result in an inflation to such an extent as to cause a depreciation of the greenback currency you have power in the hands of your president already by which if under any fortuitous combination of bankers and politicians a depreciation should be brought about he could at once put a stop to it by calling in the issue and issue bonds in any sum he pleases the only difference would be the rate of interest this bill provides for interest at 3 per cent and under the present authority of the president the bonds would bear 4 per cent but you say that is only for redemption very well issue your noninterestbearing money and then if the necessity comes issue your interestbearing money even then there will be an enormous saving these greenbacks going out unhampered by the conditions and provisos with which you burdened the old greenback would carry the prosecution of the war forward at least for two years before there could be any necessity for the issue of interestbearing bonds how cowardly it is for you to stand here and cry aloud under the pretense that the necessity is now so urgent day after day month after month you saw this coming you declared that it would come but that you were going to use all means exhaust all efforts to avoid it and bring about peace you went down in humiliating disgraceful cowardly abasement in the name of peace you have failed at this time we stand menaced by a foreign foe the booming of cannons proclaims it at our doors the mass of the american people the bone and sinew of the state the men to stand by your elbow in day of work or the day of battle are ready and willing to do or die for our glorious country we offer our lives our treasure a freewill offering but we do claim and demand that the holy impulses of patriotism be not trodden under foot and sacrificed at the demand of the molochs of greed who are willing to barter honor for gold let us act in full light of reason declaring our

man in admiration of any people willing to fight and if need be die for freedom or in sympathy with their cause and from the beginning my heart has ever beaten with warm sympathy for the patriots who are engaged in the holy cause of liberty in that island but sir i have never forgotten that i am an american and that the citizens first duty is to his own country that it is of the highest importance that the welfare and peace of the american citizen shall be protected and i would reprobate any illadvised extreme impulsive action illtimed at its taking that would involve our country in war with any other country i have felt sir that we owed something to a nation with whom we are in relations of treaty that some consideration was due to spain and more far more to the welfare of our own people therefore i have endeavored to repress that feeling which i think is in every american heart and prompts us to rise up and say that the strong arm of our country should be lifted in behalf of a people struggling for liberty and national life when facing such a contest it is impossible for us to forget the time agone when our patriot fathers were engaged in a similar struggle when they were battling for independence and sowing the seed that was to spring tip and blossom into the brightest flower that ever bloomed in the garden of nations reflections upon that period of our own history bring to our hearts emotions of sympathy and there is no true americani care not what his party affiliationswho does not feel a lively sympathy for these patriots struggling for their own independence i have desired that we should proceed with caution because any step will involve that which is to us of the greatest moment the happiness of the american people we can not afford to sacrifice their happiness in order to bring happiness to any other people however unfortunate they may be we have a treaty of friendship and commerce with the government of spain cuba is a part of her dominion and though she has maintained a stubborn and up to this time successful resistance to this dominion insomuch that she has a fashion of government and undoubted war exists to take action officially declaring the cuban republic an independent state would under the circumstances be an affront that the spanish government could hardly fail to resent it would necessarily result in war however unequal the contest therefore i do not agree with those who would go so far but to pass a resolution according to them belligerent rights could not be a just cause of national offense in the comity of nations it is a recognized privilege where a state of war exists and there is some form of government spain xxxi49 herself did not hesitate but was prompt to exercise it when the southern states took up arms and accepted war in their effort to resist coercion when they attempted to secede from the union i have therefore been willing at all times to join in recognizing the state of belligerency it might be that smarting under their failure to suppress the insurgents the spanish government would resent such action and go to the extreme of hostilities against us in that event the responsibility of war would rest with spain i am for peace americans should desire poace at all times and desire it above all things but only where it can be maintained with honor in a simple republic it is absolutely necessary that the purposes of good government may be carried out war inevitably intensifies administrative power in the hands of government if the war is of successful issue if my own party were in power under that condition i should have grave fears lest it might under temptation yield to abuses of power and wander away from the simple principles of its founders and its creed much more would i regret to see the republican party placed in this position i am opposed to the republican party heart and soul in all its points of difference from the democratic party i am opposed to centralized power in the government i am opposed still to any infraction of the constitutional rights of the states i still believe with jefferson not only in the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our safety at home and peace abroad but also in the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and as the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies i am opposed to paternalism of every form and deny the right of any american citizen or class of citizens to take exclusive benefits from the government at the expense of other citizens who do not share the benefits i am opposed to the fiscal policy of the republican party because it taxes the many for the benefit of the few i am opposed to its financial policy as practiced for the establishment of the gold standard and extension of the powers and privileges of the national banksdiametrically and iireconcilably opposed to it and while it is pursued i shall not fail here and elsewhere to arraign it as designed and tending to lessen the price of property and enhance the value of money promotive of poverty of the masses and of opulence of the classes already rich i am opposed to every bounty and every discrimination and claim they are never justified by any apparent reason i am opposed to all kinds of federal interference in state affairs except as authorized by the constitution strictly construed therefore i regard tenure of power by the republican party at all times as subversive of popular rights and a national calamity it is my firm belief that if left in power after a successful war it would strengthen and further establish all these evils which i regard as so inimical to public welfare we are confronted at present with economic problems that i desire to see settled by the calm unhindered patriotic reflection of the people who own and should control this government if unembarrassed by unusual excitement i believe they will be determined correctly the intervention of war might indefinitely postpone possibly destroy all hope of correct solution in view of all this i have endeavored to suppress my natural desire to see our government undertake to stop a war which is cruel barbarous and an offense to civilization i hold the liberty and happiness of my own people as of the highest importance and i have not wished to see them in any wise imperiled but for this for the fear alone that they might be jeopardized i would have been ready at any time during the last two years to send our ships of war and drive the spanish soldier from the island of cuba and have them protect the cuban flag with their guns but it seems to me sir we should not remain longer inactive that now we should pass the resolution already passed by the senate according to the cubans the right of belligerency this is not just provocation of a declaration of war no nation can afford to go to war without just cause much less spain under existing conditions she could expect nothing but humiliation and disgrace it is well known that her exchequer is wellnigh bankrupt that she has neither money nor credit she has exhausted herself in a futile effort to suppress the cubans think of itl convoy after convoy has been sent thousands upon thousands of armed soldiers have been poured out upon the island to make war againstthirtyodd thousand insurgent soldiers almost unarmed unclad and unfed she is no nearer success than she was two years ago then what could she expect from a war with us i think the time has come for action we may no longer close our eyes to the scenes and deafen our ears to the sounds of sickening harrowing human misery and death these scenes these sounds are at our very shores we have a certain responsibility and in selfrespect in the name of civilization for the sake of humanity we should take some step toward ending them it is said by some that accord of belligerency will not help their condition the honorable gentleman from illinois has argued on this line i believe it would i believe that in less than six months the trouble would end and leave the cubans victorious volunteers from other countries would flock to their assistance we are pointed to the fact that our vessels would be subject to the right of search let it be so we are able to see that that right is not abused that our flag and citizens are respected when spain recognized the confederate states as belligerents they subjected their vessels to the right of search yet there was no war between the unitedstates and spain spain has at this time troubles enough without grasping for new ones neither was there war with the other powers that declared the confederates belligerents belligerent rights of no benefit to the cubans and no justification of our declaring belligerency ah what has come over the spirit of the people of this administration and of this congress why sir we need not go beyond this hall here in the last congress a resolution of exactly similar import except that it was not a joint resolution was introduced reported from the committee on foreign affairs gentlemen on that side and on this side of the house spoke in support of it and there was a cheering agreement on the part of representatives in this house upon the position which i now assume it received the almost if not quite unanimous support of republicans here that news went to cuba and inspired afresh the hearts of the patriots there and they expected that the american government would recognize their belligerent rights we were told by different gentlemen here in the house on the republican side that it was necessary and justifiable and would be beneficial to cubas cause and the president of the united states was appealed to to carry into effect the wish of congress it was stated here by distinguished gentlemen that there was no doubt that the president of the united states in recognition of his duty would acquiesce in the demands of congress under the circumstances and recognize the belligerent rights of the cuban patriots let me read in response to a question the distinguished chairman of the committee on foreign affairs who was also then the chairman of the committee on foreign affairs answering an interrogatory said i will endeavor to answer the question as clearly and practically as i can the gentleman has struck the essential questionthe one that transcends all the rest that question of recognizing cuban belligerency is the one on which the american people have been fixing their attention most earnestly this house has been flooded with petitions and memorials by thousands from legislatures chambers of commerce societies from churches from associations of every kind and from individual citizens by tens of thousands your committee room has been choked with them there is no other subject for years on which there has been so vast and multitudinous an expression of the peoples will as this question of recognizing the belligerency of the cubans who are struggling for freedom they go to the very heart of the question the people know just what is most wanted and they ask us to do it"], [0.07969707250595093, 0.9203029274940491, 1, "within the limited time allotted mne i can do nothing more than enter my protest against the passage of this bill we have before us a measure which upon its face and according to the report of the majority of the ways and means committee imposes taxes upon the people of the united states amounting to more than 273 000 000 taking the receipts for the last fiscal year as a basis and yet it was only reported to the house on last friday taken up for consideration last monday and will be finally acted upon next wednesday the bill before us not only imposes burdens to the extent named but reaches every section of the country and lays its heavy hand upon every man woman and child in the united states and still we are not permitted to consider it for more than nine days it is not within the power of any member who is not one of the majority of the ways and means committee to analyze this measure correctly and fully within the short time given for its consideration its passage however is in perfect keepingwith the action of this house a few days ago in hurrying throngh four appropriation bills within the space of thirtysix hours involving an expenditure of more than 73 000 000 only twenty minutes on each side were allowed for the consideration of each of these bills and no opportunity whatever was given for amendment we are informed in the majority report of the ways and means committee the committee from which this bill emanated that when it shall have been enacted into law it will probably increase the revenues over and above those produced by the present tariff law by one hundred and thirteen millions of dollarsl for what purpose let me ask is this anticipated enormous increase desired and sought to be made is it in order that the congress may have opportunity to expend the public money in wasteful extravagance or is it for another purposea purpose which in my judgment will be even more dangerous and oppressive than immoderate and unjustifiable appropriationsto enable the secretaryof the treasury to gather into the treasury with the surplus revenue that will accrue the united states and the treasury notes popularly known as greenbacks and sherman notes and hold them in the vaults in order to protect the gold reserve under which policy the people can not use them for the purposes of money now in my judgment one of these two things will inevitably result should revenue be produced by this bill to the extent estimated by the majority of the committee on ways and means in their report either wasteful extravagance in the expenditure of public money or the accumulation in the treasury of the united states and treasury notes that are now in circulation so that if the double policy involved in this billthat of protection and that of the practical retirement of the greenbacks and sherman notes in order to protectthe gold reserveshould prevail we shall have increased taxation on the one hand and on the other hand a reduced circulation despite increasing population and produttion with the prices of all protected articles rapidly advancing in the last election the question before the american people was not so much a question of taxation as it was a question of providing for the people a currency that would abunxxx15 dantly suffice to meet their wants the republicans through their most eminent leaders have now made haste to say that the greenbacks and sherman notes amounting at the present time to 464 231 296 will not be retired i do not believe it will be their policy to maintain the gold reserve by the issuance and sale of onds no that will not be their policy but they apparently hope through the operation of the pending bill and through the accrual of an unnecessarily large revenue to accumulate the geenbacks and sherman notes in sufficient amount to prevent frther raids upon the gold reserve and thereby avoid the necessity of an issue of bonds if either of the objects i have stated be not contemplated why then has the committee on ways and means seen proper to prepare and present to this house this bill which in its opinion and according to its report will yield about 113 000 000 more revenue than did the wilson tariff act during the last fiscal year though in my opinion the expenditures were entirely too large for the fiscal year 1896 and ought to have been reduced by at least fifty millions of dollars without impairing the efficiency of the administration of the government they only exceeded for that year the revenues by 25 208 245 70 in that year we expended 352 179 446 08 in addition to our postal revenues if the incometax feature of the wilson tariff act had been permitted to stand the receipts accruing from that provision would have more than made up the deficiency named but to the surprise of the countryand i might say to the countrys great detrimentthe supreme court in its wisdom declared the income tax to be unconstitutional and therefore null and void my judgment is that the difference between our expenditures and our receipts for the current year will not be greater than it was for the fiscal year 1896 if indeed so great and if it should prove true as estimated in the majority report of the ways and means committee that the next years revenues will exceed the revenues of 1896 by 113 000 000 then we shallhave from ninety million to one hundred million dollars unnecessarily wrung from the necessities and hard earnings of the people to lie idle in the treasury or to be used to gather and maintain in the treasury the greenbacks and sherman notes now in circulation and performing the functions of money or to be squandered in wasteful and inexcusable extravagance so much for the general purpose and object of this remarkable measureprotection of special industries and heavy taxation upon the consumers of the country without regard to age sex or condition excepting only that it will fall first and heaviest upon those least able to bear it and a surplus revenue to be used for unworthy and unnecessary objects or for the practical retirementof the greenbacks and sherman notes the future alone will disclose whether my prediction be correct of course the result will depend entirely upon the amount of revenue actually to be derived under the bill should it become law as now contemplated but in the brief space allotted to me i desire to call the attention of this committee to one industry which it occurs to me will be the greatest sufferer from this measurethe cotton industry in 1896 though we had a short crop of cotton and a falling price after supplying the home market we exported cotton grown in this country of the value of 19 056 460almost onefourth in value of all the exports that left our shores what relief if any has been given to the cotton grower of the south by thisbill the distinguished gentleman from iowa on yesterday spoke eloquently of the beauties of protection and of its great benefit to people of all classes the gentleman is a member of the ways and means committee and he took good care to have binding twine placed on the free list though when it came to cotton grown so abundantly in the state wherein i live what do we find cotton ties which under the wilson tariff act were put on the free list are now heavily taxed bagging which was also on the free list is likewise heavily taxed farm implements treated so generously by the wilson act are taxed 45 per cent cotton gins carry a burden of 45 per cent and last though not least salt is taken from the free list and taxed with a proviso however for the benefit of the armours of the country and of the fishermen of the coasts of maine and massachusetts allowing a rebate on all salt used in canned goods and fish exported that is the manner in which the cotton man has been treated i have not time to call attention to the increased taxessome of them being exceedingly heavyupon the cotton growers household and kitchen furniture and upon everything that he must wear from his hat to his shoes but i do not hesitate to say that a representative from the section in which i live who would under any circumstances vote for such a measure as this ought to be lashed out of public life i have lived allmy years among those who grow cotton i am entirely familiar with their vicissitudes and hardships the labor the trouble and the perils that attend the cultivation of cotton from early morn to dewy eve all through the year from the 1st day of january to the 81st day of december the growerofcotton is in his field and then after twelve months of hard and anxious toil he too often finds under the wicked systems of finance and commerce that have grown up not only in this country but elsewhere that despite his industry energy patience and economy the proceeds of his crop are scarcely snfficient to meet his expenses the bale of cotton which he has produced is thrown upon a marketweighted down by excessive taxation and thus it starts upon its destination for a foreign country fall river and other american manufacturing centers do not control its price here cotton is sold only for what it brings at liverpool less the charges for handling and transportation our home manufacturers get the advantage of a near marketat a foreign price with foreign competition yet our republican tfriends in framing this bill took especial care of almost everything else except this great industry which affects the wealth the comfort and the happiness of so many millions of people and the prosperity of so many states an industry that furnishes clothing to the world and without which the manufacturing establishments ofthe east and of europe would close their doors and the labor employed would be driven forth to starve can prosperity proceed from grievous and bur densome taxation or from unbridled extravagance or from cruel contraction of the circulating medium if so and the pending bill should in all its provisions becrystallized into law thiscoun try will without delay realize an abundant and a universal prosperity and all classes and conditions in society will rejoice in the hange that has taken place in the administration of the federal uovernment but sir prosperity can not will not come by such methods as this bill offers taxation can not make wealth nor can the want of a sufficient currency enhance the valueof property orof labor nor can governmental extravagance produce abeneficial effect upon the individual citizen this bill is the response which the republican party has made to poppar favor asexpressed at the late election nothing else we are old will be done at the present session exceptto pass some such measure as this and the four general appropriation bills which have already gone to the senate the democratic and populist barties can stand such a policy asthis they will be benefited by it but can the people stand it i

admitted that this was the 6vil to be remedied and contended that they and they alone could be safely trusted to afford relief they admitted that our currency system was in disorder that under the existing laws the vast hgricultural regions were being reduced to poverty and despair but contended that the success of the democratic nominees and the enforcement of the financial policy enunciated in the chicago platform would intensify instead of curing the affliction to maintain their hold upon the government in 1892 the stock jobbers and dollar mongers took charge of the democratic convention nominated the distinguished exsheriff of buffalo for the presidency and in every part of the country raised the shibboleth of tariff reform and it was carried to triumphant victory but the cleveland administration was devoted wholly to an effort to render the gold standard perpetual in this country now mr mckinley succeeds his great friend and supporter by the help of men who placed cleveland in the white house after a campaign in which currency reform was the only subject seriougly discussed and announces that the tariff is the only subject worthy of the consideration of his administration how sweetly th goldbug brethren dwell together in unity major mckinley seems to forget that he was enthusiastically supported by the free traders of new england and new york on the ground that the finances and not the tariff needed attention as cleveland forgot that he was elected to the presidency by the farmers who expected tariff reform and not a crusade against silver last year the money question was paramount here and there a puny voice demanded a return to mckinleyism but the occasional cry of the lonely protectionist was drowned by a thousand voices demanding a reformation of the finances this it was that marshaled to the support of mckinley and hobart the inventors followers and lickspittles of an administration democratic in name but distinctly republican in its policies for i call attention to the fact that wh le every means fair and foul was resortcd to by mr cleveland to insure the success of his campaign in favor of the gold standard as president never did he lift a finger to secure the enactment of tariff laws in harmony with the declaration of the chicago platform and that at the end of three years 6f unceasing warfare upon the party that placed him in power he went over baq and baggage to the enemy and thank god has been there ever since there let him remain he is congenial company and his successor need only allow the works of grover to remain untouched and the triumph of gold monometallism will be complete the wilsqn bill is a protective measure with few features to distinguish it from the enactments placed on the statute books by republicans the pretense that th6re is even a suggestion of free trade in it is ridiculous free trade as a practical question has had no place in political discussions in this country during this generation it has been discussed as an academic question but hot as a practical one all parties have agreed that in this country under existing conditions free trade or anything nearly approaching it is impossible the enormous sums required to defray the expenses of the federal government can only be raised by levying duties upon imports and theseduties necessarily give home mahufacturers an advantage over foreign competitors in the american market i assert without the fear of successful contradiction that revenue duties levied with no thought of affording protection for the sake of protection would impose upon every item of every schedule in the bill now pending before this house the gross labor cost of the commodity in any part of the world in f~ci as often as protection has been the subject of discussion in his chamber its walls have echoed speeches demanding the imposi ion of protective duties equivalent to three or four times the labor cost of the commodities the demand for the imposition of iiese prohibitive duties has been based upon the pretense that ihey were intended to cover the difference between the cost of lab6r in this country and europe meantime vast combinations undisturbed by competition from abroad have taken shelter in these infamous enactments and subjected the people of the continent to unrestrained pillage and plunder what evidence has been or can be produced to show that under the wilson bill american manufacturers are unable to do a profitable business what manufacturing plant has closed on account of excessive foreign competition we know that hundreds have ceased operation because the poverty of consumers has left them without customers we know that the peoples pockets are empty and that trade is stagnant because they are empty we know that there is no demand for manufactured goods but we know also that this is because the scarcity of money has curtailed demand thousands are in rags and many more thousands in straightened circumstances hence a slight demand for clothing thousands are hungry because they are without employment and destitute of money if there has been a falling off in the output of the american manufacturer there has occurred a larger decline in the amount of foreign manufactures imported into this country scarcity of money accounts for one as well as for the other much stress has been laid upon the evil effects of the wilson bill upon our wool manufacturers i assert that with a normal demand for woolen goods our woolen manufacturers would prosper under the wilson bill as they never have prospered heretofore in the city in which i reside is one of the largest woolen mills in the country last year more fortunate than most concerns of its kind it found a stealy demand for its product the result was an unprecedented volume of business and satisfactory profits for its ownersthe first it had earned in eight years for ingular as it may seem to my friends on the other side of this chamber this same factory did not earn a dollar of profits nor declare a single dividend while the mckinley law of 1891 was on the statute books gentlemen what your constituents need is more money to buy goods with and not higher prices for goods what the manufacturers need is higher prices for farm products so that the masses may receive for their labor sufficient compensation to enable them to buy the necessaries of life the people can not buy larger amounts of manufactured goods at higher prices than they have been buying at prices now prevailing how can gentlemen persuade themselves that high or low tariffs are responsible for the existing depression how can they shut their eyes to the fact that for years everywherethroughout the old world as well as in this countryindustrial conditions have been similar in germany where protective duties are highest fknd in freetrade england the agriculturist the small trader and shopkeeper and the laborerthe humbler classes comprising the vast majority of the populationare in despair and in every quarter of the globe debtors are being ground to powder over and over again the worlds greatest statesmen and economists have pointed to this dead level of miseryto misfortunes which preyalike upon all countries and all peoplesas affording conclusive evidence that the same cause operates everywhere to produce the same effect misery prevails everywhere because everywhere except in the countingrooms of th9 money centers a money famine prevails a money famine which began with the demonetization of silver in 1873 which has been increasing in intensity 6ver since and which has caused and is still causing a shrinkage in the value of all forms of property and a corresponding increase in the value of money the owners of money mortgages and bonds and other beneficiaries of governmental favoritism have thrived while misfortunes unescapable by all others have multiplied not content with monopolizing the money of the world the great syndicates of the money centers have obtained mastery of every ieid affording opportunity for the monopoly of the natural resources of the earth or for profit making by virtue of governmental favoritism they own the railroads the ships that plow the deep the coal mines the forests and the fisheries they own the streetcar lines the telegraph the telephone the water works and all utilities essential to the transaction of business they preside over the trusts and combines that will profit by the enactment of the pending measure by resort to the ample means provided bylaws of their own enactment they have through the medium of the modern corporation organized a network of companies and combines which everywhere exercise the highest function of sovereigntythe right to impose taxes the bill under consideration is intended to clothe the tariff barons of the united states with this power of sovereignty the license so long enjoyed by the great railroad magnates to arbitrarily fix the terms upon which the people may use the public highways clothes the stock jobbers and financial desperadoes of two continents with the taxing power and they have exercised it with a wantonness and a disregard of the rights of mankind hitherto unheard of in the annals of the world the coal barons stand next in the list of public enemies who by the exercise of the taxing power are preying upon defenseless humanity the standard oil company the sugar trust the steelrail pool the woodenware pool the nail trust the barbedwire trustthe almost innumerable children of class legislation that for a quarter of a century have preyed upon the peop le have been enabled to do so under the cover of governmental favoritism and by exemption from prosecution for the violation of the laws of the country by the beneficiaries of laws conferring special privileges and the ntire brood of monsters are housed in the same countingrooms the system of modern monopolies was devised by the classes who will be benefited by the passage of the pending measure the money monopoly is the legitimate parent of every member of the family of corporation vampires that prey upon mankind and civilization the people have set for themselves the task of killing the parent to the end that thereafter they may discipline its rapacious progeny nothing that you can do will permanently divert them from this purpose nothing can obscure the issue joined in 1896 you may enact this law as you undoubtedly will ard others like it in the vain hope that thereby the tariff and not tie money question will be made the paramount issue of american nolitics the ruse will fail our constituents and yoursrepublicans democrats populists all the peopleexpect not legislation intended to visit upon them the affliction of higher prices for the necessities of life but legislation effectively reforming the finances we differ as to methods but not as to the requirements of the situation while ridiculing the plan proposed by the democrats you proposed another and by means and methods which i do not mean to discuss have secured possession of the government in all its bra aches the people will hold you to the performance of your promise or scourge you from this chamber for its nonfulfillment and nothing that you can do no artifice of which you are capable will retire this question from consideration hntil it is settled and settled right gentlemen discuss the existing worldwide depression of trade as if it had come upon mankind suddenlyas if no one expected its visitation why even before the fatal departure of 1873 the appalling consequences of that act were accurately foretold a year before the passage of the law known as the demonetization act one of englands most enlightened economists after a critical examination of the bill wrote to mr hooper of massachusetts then a member of this house and the one chargeable with the responsibility of the passage of the law a letter sounding a note of warning and faithfully picturing the appalling consequences that have followed in reference to the section substituting the gold for the silver dollar as the unit of value the writer expressed the fear that mr looper and other americans had fallen under the influence of extreme british monometallists and in conclusion said in substance that if the united states should take the initiative and other great nations should follow our example and undertake to make the gold standard universal the attempt would be followed by consequences fatal to the prosperity of all nations and injurious to all classes except owners of money and those who live on fixed incomes i do not pretend to quote his exact worgs but this is almost the exact language in which mr ernest seyd of england foretold the appalling evils about to be brought upon the world here was foreshadowed the paralysis of trade the stagnation of industries the destruction of fortrnes the evictions from mortgaged homes the suffering of labor which have filled the world with despairing men weeping women and starving children for want of time i forego quoting from others notably many distinguished americans who a little later sounded a similar warning upon what did these prophets predicate their forebodings why upon a principle of monetary science that never has been and never will be questioned by a respectable authority i challenge any gentleman on the other side to hazard his reputation by questioning the infallibility of the quantitive theory of money those who protest against increasing the volnine of currency on the ground that inflation would produce evil consequences recognize the quantitive theory those who protest against the contraction of currency recognize it the objection to inflation is that it would produce an unhealthy increase in prices the objection to contraction is that it would produce a ruinous decline in prices if any proposition in economics is actually unassailable it is that the quantity of money in circulation determines the price of commodities increase tho volume of money in circulation and prices rise diminish it and zhey fall what was more natural then than that political economists of all schools should have concurred in the belief that the experiment of gold monometallism embarked in in 1878 and stubbornly continued ever since would be productive of the unhappy conditions now existing in all parts of the world here was a proposition to outlaw onehalf the worlds supply of metallic money and to diininish by onehalf the source from which throughout all the ages it had been replenished metallic money is the basis of all forms of credit money to deplete the base was to necessitate the depletion of the superstructure of credit resting upon it hence sooner or later credits also must be scaled down but why make an argument to sustain this position the republican party recognized it and admitted the whole case made out by the democrats by inserting in the st louis platform a demand for international bimetallism this demand for international bimetallism was a plea of guilty to the indictment charging that the demonetization of silver was either a blunder or a crime you admit the necessity of returning to bimetallism what is this but an admission that the demonetization act of 1873 was the beginning of a financial policy essentially wrong and injurious in its inception and which is still wrong in theory and injurious in practice the same men and the same influences now controlling the policies of the government procured the enactment of the law of 1873 and they claim that they and they alone are capable of righting the mischief if the passage of the law was a blunder shall we trust the blunderers to apply a remedy if a crime shall the punishment of the criminals be intrusted to their own hands and why do you demand international bimetallism is it not because you know that on account of the scarcity of gold its purchasing power has immensely increased and that this increase in the purchasing power of money has crippled all industries and impoverished all producers if this is not true then there is no necessity for the restoration of bimetallism if it is true how will higher tariffs which mean higher prices for commodities relieve the distress produced by a money famine which deprives millions of the ability to buy goods at any price if the depression is the result of an unwise change in the monetary system why do gentlemen seek a remedy for a particular class of sufferers if they are bent on pursuing this policy are they quite sure that in selecting the manufacturers of this country as governmental favorites they are helping the chief sufferers have the tariff barons suffered greater misfortunes than the farmers are the classes who appeared before the ways and means committee and clamored for the help of the government being evicted from their homes by the new england loan and insurance companies who would be most benefited by bimetallism whether brought about by international agreement or by independent action of this countrythe owners of bonds and mortgages or the men who must pay these bonds and mortgages i assume that everybody will agree that the debtors would be most benefited the conclusion is unescapable that the debtors have been the chief sufferers from the vicious financial policy which republicans say can only be displaced by international agreement and which we contend must be displaced before the restoration of prosperity is made possible under such circumstances how have you arrived at the conclusion that the money lenders and not the borrowers the rich and not the poor the trusts combines and corporations and not the people should be made again and again and continually the subjects of governmental favoritism"], [0.0839700698852539, 0.9160299301147461, 1, "almost every reason which can be given for the enactment of aprotectivetariff law is a defense of all the trustsin existence and it was his clear perceptibnxof this fact thatmoved mr blaine to utter his celebrated protest against the assaults which were begun upon these combinations ten years ago they tell us that these large aggregations of capital by guarding against the competition which theycall industrial warfare can produce their goods more cheaply and will therefore sell them more cheaply this is the old argument over again for years the friends of protection have insisted that if congress would secure our domestic manufacturers against the competition of the old world these gentlemen would within a reasonable time become rich enough and strong enough to voluntarilyreduce the price of their goods or if they did not reduce prices voluntarily they would be forced to do so by domestic competition they persuaded many people to believe that these manufacturers when relieved from f oreign competition would in time become competitors against each other but those who believed that miscalculated the strength and intensity of human greed had they been as wise at first as they have become through experience they would have known that men who have long enjoyed an immunity from competition will resort to every possible means to continue that immunity andas for my part i do not wonder that having been taught by the apostles of protection that they can be made rich and powerful by being savedfrom competition against foreigners they should fully understand that they can be made richer and more powerful by being savedfrom competition among themselves the friends of protection can not assail the trusts without admitting the democratic contention that unrestricted competition is desirable and that admission overturns the very foundation of the protective system political parties must be consistent in their positions and however honestly the republican party may be opposed to trusts as an independent proposition it can not and it will not oppose them if in doing so it finds it necessary to attack even by inference its favorite theory it is not surprising there fore that republican members of this house like the gentleman from massachusetts have volunteered to defend the trusts the country however will understand that the gentleman from massachusetts while bolder in his speech has not been different in his conduct from the rest of his party fromthe beginning to the end of the debate on this bill both in the house and in the senate you have consistently and persistently defeated every effort to destroy these unlawful combinations of capital let us look for a moment at the attitude of the two parties on this question you hadprepared a bill intended to prevent foreign competition andyou averred~that domestic competition would sufficiently reduce the price of all commodities to the people we controverted your proposition and asserted that the manufacturers of this country having been secured against foreign competition by aprotectie tariff would secure themselves against domestic competition by combinations among themselves thusthe issue was made up when we entered upon the consideration of this bill by paragraphs and at the very earliest opportunity we tested your confidence in your position to the first paragraph of the bill we offered an amendment which provided that if the domestic manufacturers did combine to escape domestic competition they should have nobenefitof your protection againstforeign competition did you gentlemen join us in this propositibn as we had a right to expect if youare really in favor of competition no sir every gentleman on that side voted to sustain a rulingof the chair which refused the house an opportunity to pass upon the question and your party in the senate hasresolutely voted down every amendment which was intended to destroy these trusts gentlemen if you are right in asserting that protection will defend our own people against foreign competition and still leave them the benefit of domestic competition why did you not deny the benefit of protection to those who deny to the people the benefit of competition applausej another more practical but not less potent reasonwhy the republican party can not undertake in earnest to suppress these hurtful combinations of capital is that its vast andcomplicated scheme of taxation for private purposes is maintained by the active and financial support of those who have personal and business connections with these trusts and as you rely upon the votes the influence andthe campaign subscriptions of trusts it isunreasonable to suppose that you will deny them a participation in the profitsoffasystemwhich they have helpedto fasten upon the country we have sufficient and abundantproof of this fact in the pending bill which gives to the sugar trust a puregratuity which experts estimate at not less than 4 000 000 annually you have made some attempt to excuse the sugar schedule upon the ground that you are seeking to stimulate the productionof sugar in thiscountry but if we admit that your duty on raw sugar is necessary to develop the sugar industry of the unitedstates itdoes notfollbw that the differential duty on refined sugar wouldb edefensible it ishardly pretendedby the advocates of this bill that the sugar refiners of this country need this differential duty in order to continue theirbusiness al that hasbeen said amountspractically to saying that the refiners of sugax are entitled to their share of protection and that is exactly what we chargewe say that you can not maintain the system without admitting to a participation in its advantages those who do not need them i am not willing to charge in this high place that the republican party has sold its intellect and conscience to the sugar trust and i prefer to believe that it has been driven by the logic of its position to the assistance of a monopoly which has grown so bold under its special privileges that it scandalizes congress and defies the power of the courts but sir the republican party must confess that it has sold itself to the sugar trust or it must admit that protection can not deny its benefits to monopoly you can not claim that the differential of 66 cents on the hundred pounds of refined sugar is required to make the sugarrefining business profitable that it is not needed is susceptible of easy demonstration the advantage which your differential gives to the sugar trust exceeds 4 000 000 annually while the reports of its own officers show that it declares dividends equal to 7 125 000 per annum and carries large sums to its reserve fund each year taking no account of the reserve fund and subtracting the 4 000 000 which you give from the 7 125 000 which it declares in dividends it shows an earning capacity of 3 125 000 without your assistance which is at least 15 per cent on the actual value of its property and sir although the actual cash value of the property owned by the sugar trust does not exceed 20 000 000 it has been capitalized at 75 000 000 and each share of its stock is today worth more than par its capital stock is divided into 37 500 000 of preferred stock upon which there is a guaranteed dividend of 7 per cent and 37 500 000 of common stock which has been paying a dividend of 12 per cent the common stock is of course absolutely worthless untilthe preferred stock is first paid in full and although it is perfectly well known to everybody who has taken the trouble to investigate the question that the 37 500 000 of common stock represents nothing except congressional favor it is today worth one hundred and fortysix cents on the dollar while the 37 500 000 which represents an actual investment of perhaps 20 000 000 is worth only one hundred and fifteen cents on the dollar with these facts staring them in the face the republicans of this house and of the senate have increased the tribute which this odious and powerful monopoly is collecting from the american people either the men who do these things are dishonest or the system which compels the doing of them is vicious i have no patience with the narrow view which can not explain the sugar schedule except upon the score of the personal dishonesty of republican senators and representatives because my experience teaches me that a dishonest man is rare in either branch of congress my deliberate judgment is that the sugar trust possesses its power over you not because it buys your individual votes but because it is a part of your system and as it helps to support your system your system is compelled to help support it and it is certain that trusts will continue to increase in number and power as long as you continue your policy of protection

neither sought nor obtained the opportunity to be heard upon this measure i have been contented even pleased to listen to anl learn from the able and exhaustive arguments of the eminent leaders of the several political parties having representatives upon this floor but the hour has now arrived when my forbearance from at least a brief discussion thereof would amount to an evasion of my duty to my constituents and infidelity to the principles i espouse i may also state that nothing short of the proound solicitude i cherish for my government and the people could induce me to hazard so much as one as young as i in the service necessarily assumes when he enters the arena of public debate upon a great question like this against trained and experienced thinkers and orators but moved as i am by an earnest desire to contribute in every way possible to the maintenance of our free institutions and the prosperity and happiness of every family in the land i can not refrain from the duty that i now feel pressing upon me to submit to this honorable body my views upon the conditions of the government and the country together with my opinion upon the proposed bill as a means of relief to both that the financial condition of the government is perplexing and that of the people is distressing every gentleman on bothsides of this chamber who has referred to them admits and no man has dared to stand before this congress to deny it no intelligent and philanthropic citizen of this republic will be satisfied with the work of this congress unless the laws enacted by it shall within a reasonable time extricate the government from its financial complications and secure to the farmers and producers of property in this country a fair price for their product and to the laborers a just compensation for their toil i have been repeatedly surprised during this discussion by thq statement made by the republicans that the existing conditions are due to the wilson bill i will not say that they do not iii truth believe it for that would be to charge them with insinceritynor will i admit that they do believe it for that would be for me to discredit their intelligence but i feel constrained to say that there are those who have a welldeveloped suspicion that their hue and cry against the wilson bill is made for the purpose of diverting our attention from the enormities and deformities of their own infamous and obnoxious offspring the dingley bill they know as everybody will sooner or later know that th6 trouble with the governments finances did not have its origin in any deficiency of the necessary money to meet the ordinary expenses of the government for there has not been a time since the ilson bill went into effect that there has not been sufficient available money in the treasury to meet all demands against iti and today notwithstanding the deficiencies in the revenue proper for each of the last four years there is a little above 122 000 000 in the treasury that can and ought to be used when needed in the payment of the current expenses of the government instead of intensifying the miseries of the people by heaping upon them the additional burdens of unjust and unnecessary taxation imposed by this bill there are features of the wilson bill that i do not approve yet all together it is in my opinion a very great improvement over the mckinley bill and perhaps the best that could be had at the tim6 it was passed i have always since its passage and do now give my unqualified and unequivocal indorsement to the income tax which constituted the most admirable because it was the fairest and most equitable part of that bill by it the great money combinations bond syndicates and multimillionaires who infest our financial centers and the gigantic corporations whose deadly fangs have paralyzed individual energies and efforts and whose ominous influences have fallen like a blight upon every section of our common country could be compelled to assist at least to some extent to defray governmental expenses such a system is so thoroughly just and essentially right that it is demanded by the people and they will have it even at the sacrifice of an amended constitution had this provision of the bill been sustained by the courts there voula have been no deficiency in the revenue under the wilson bill for it would have produced annually as much revenue as the mckinley bill produced in any year of its existence hence the censure if there ought to be any for deficiencies under the wilson bill must be visited on the tribunal that declared the income tax unconst7 tutional and not on the democratic party the principle involved in the measure had been more than once upheld by the supreme court of this country and in the severest throes of financial digtress this government has ever experienced it was resorted to with great efficiency no man was then heard to doubt its equity or question its constitutionality but when its benedictions are sought to lighten the burdens of a distressed people in their heroic struggle against the exterminating power of trusts syndicates monopolies in concluding i wish to say a word to the gentleman from kansas who was very complimentary to me the other day in his remarks for which i thank him and i was not offended by his classing me with those who are striving to enslave mankind he belongs to that class of peoplewho seem to be opand combinations of wealth it is then for the first time unconstitutional it is now unnecessary for me to call the attention of the house and the country to a detailed history of the litigation that resulted in the overthrow of that provision a discriminating public has long since arrived at a settled and no doubt intelligent conclusion about that matter and i could not disturb them if i would and would not if i could but a few words now about the deficiencies in the revenues the official records of this government show that the deficiency under the mckinley bill for the fiscal year ending june 30 1894 was almost as great as the combined deficiencies for the two fiscal years of 189495 and 189596 under the wilson bill the figures are as follows viz deficit for the year ending june 30 1894 72 325 448 deficit for the year ending june 30 1805 46 558 09 deficit for the year ending june 30 189 28 578 671 that is to say the deficiency for the last year under the mckinley bill only lacked 2 812 132 in amounting to as much as the deficiencies for the two years under the wilson bill these figures the republicans do not and can not deny but they seek to avoid their effect by the contention that foreign producers in view of the probabilities that a democratic tariff bill enlarging the free list and lessening duties would be passed at an early date withheld their shipments in order that they might send their products into our markets free or at greatly reduced rates under such law when enacted this states their plea in avoidance fully and fairly or if it does not i ask anyone on that side of thechamber to correct it there would have been after the passage of the wilson bill one sure and inevitable result growing outof such a course on the part of the foreign producer and that would have been a large increase in the value of free imports for as soon as the wilson bill took effect they would have flooded our markets with the vast quantities of their products which they had piledup in their warehouses in anticipation of that event the free list had been enlarged the duties lowered on many articles and if they as our republican friends claim had withheld their goods in the previous year awaiting these conditions the time had ariived if it can be shown therefore that the free imports in the year 189495 greatly increased over those of 189394 i will feel compelled to confess that the republicans have with reasonable certainty sustained their contention if that can not be shown to be so they ought with frankness to admit the falsity and delusion of their statement the records show that the free importations for the year ending june 30 1895 were 16 561 741 less than for the previous year notwithauding the enlargement of the free list by the wilson bill which feature the republicans have so severely criticised and s bitterly denounced this is not all that the records show touching this paint they show that the value of free importations for no one of the two complete fiscal years that the wilson bill has been in operation was as great as that for the last year the mckinley law was in force so that on this showing i am willing to submit to the people of this country whether or not their position is correct there is another record fact to which attention is called in this connection the dutiable imports absolutely increased 93 037 084 during the first year under the wilson bill over those of the last year under the mckinley bill and again increased in the second year of the wilson bills existence thereby demonstrating the democratic theory that a less rate of duty than that imposed by the mckinley law would yield a larger revenue to the government and of course would greatly diminish the power of the classes to rob and plunder the masses before leaving this point i desire to also state that the dutiable importations were 110 928 432 less in the fiscal year 189192 than for the year 189091 and 152 045 023 less than for 188990 i have not heard any republican give a reason for these occurrences and i have great cnriosity to know what cause they will assign therefor but prolific as they are in evasions and artful in hoodwinking and deceiving the people as they have shown themselves to be it is surmised that they will in some way attempt to conceal or distort the proper and entire significance of these figures rather than confess the existence of the financial stringency that made them unavoidable while i do not now and never will give my assent to the doctrine that there ought to be annual deficits in our revenues yet i dare to say that it will be a menace to the best interest of the people of this country to have a revenue system that will supply the full amount of money required to meet the expenses of the government while the government is coerced into the shameful and humiliating business of selling bonds thus impoverishing and enslaving its people to procure gold with which to satisfy the greed and avarice of the money sharks of the country no apter illustration ofthis truth can be found than that which has occurred within the last two years if the revenues proper had been equal to the ordinary expenditures there would be at this time stored away in the government treasury all the sherman notes and 4most likely the greater part of greenback notes hence the curiency of the country would have been contracted by that much more than it was no sane person will doubt that the then secretary of the treasury would have gladly withheld thai part of our money from circulation had not the current demands against the government imperatively required him to pay it out it is therefore insisted that under the circumstances the deficiency in the revenue affording as it did a necessity and a means of returning these notes into circulation among the people was a blessing and not a disaster to them ishould be glad to know from the republicans what they propose to do with tho treasury and greenback notes redeemed in gold when there shal have been sufficient revenuesreceived from the ordinary sources to meet all the expenditures of the government otherthan gold purchases the people of this country are vitally interested in this inquiry and republican leaders will do them a service by answering it here and now any system that will produce the amount of money requisite to the operation of the government will result in an accumulation in the treasury of a sum equal to the treasury notes and greenbacks redeemed in gold and to that extent a contraction of the circulation this may be what the republicans want but i admonish them vigorously that it is not what the m asses of the people of this country will submit to that they axe able and by the terms of their wicked and iniquitous late alliance with the money power are obligated to and will accomplish such result i do not doubt but it is equally certain that when the lay of reckoning shall come an indignant but enlightened constituency will drive them from place and power to see the receipts of his government ordinary and extraordinary less than the lair and economical demands upon it is hiumiliating to every american who loves that government but to see its functions employed and prostituted to destroy the peace happiness and prosperity of its citizens is a detestable outrage he will not tolerate this government is entitled to exact from its citizens and withdraw from circulation temporarily so much money as may be required to pay the expense of its frugal administration but to purposely exact or withdraw more though done by authority of law is no less a wrong than is committed by the desperado who holds up the traveler on the highway and compels him at the point of the gleaming dagger to deliver his money it really seems to have been forgotten by many statesmen that when there is a disparity between receipts and expenditures it can be avoided as effectually by lowering the excessive as it can be by increasing the lowerthat is to say in the present case a balance between the debits and credits can be effected just as easily and with much more reason and equity for it by lessening the expenditures this in my opinion is the only proper just and certain remedy by which to overcome the annually recurring deficiencies in the revenue i am sure that without hindrance to the most perfect and efficient administration of the government and without violence to any duty or obligation imposed upon it by sound reason or a wellfounded patriotic sentiment the ex penses as compared with those of the last few years can be and ought to be very much diminished my purpose is always to be conservative and i shall not set aside that rule now but when thousandsyes mill ionsof our people have been forced to surrender all luxuries and many of them to stint themselves in the necessities of life i kiow that it is neither discreditable nor demagogical to stand up and insist on the most rigid economy in the administration of governmental affairs we are the chosen servants and trustees of the people and we shall not be blameless and without fault if in the discharge of the trust reposed in us we shall fail to exercise the same sound judgment untiring energy and unabating diligence with which the private citizen attends his individual affairs notwithstanding the greatly enhanced purchasing power of the dollar as is now conceded by all the annual expenses of the government named in dollars grew 103 910 299 and in purchasing power fully 200 000 000 from 7he last year of clevelands first administration to the last year of harrisons administration and while the administration just closed succeeded in reducing the annual disbursements very much as compared with the last year of harrisons administration 189293 yet other and greater reductions can and ought to be had the figures bearing on this point are as follows expenditures for the year ending june 30 1889 5 464 589 expenditures for the year ending june 30 1893 4 374 888 expenditures for the year ending june 30 1896 411 678 654 the proposition toaat i assert is that a very large part of the annual disbursemeni s are for charges fixed many years ago before the dollar had been iven its present commanding position over the commodities of the country hence no wrong will be perpetrated upon the beneficiariesthereof by reducing them in the sarae proportion in which the purchasing power of the dollar has increased fidelity to the commission we bear demands that this truth shall be recognized as fully in the executioli of our trusts as it is in the conduct of individul business but as heretofore said there has not been a time since thewilson bill became a law that there was not sufficient available money in the treasury to meet the ordinary current charges against it if this is a correct utterance i and there can be no doubt of it the conclusion is irresistible that whatever trouble the government has experienced in financial matters has not been due to or grown out ofany lack of money to defray its expenses republicans may not coincide with the statement but i make it broad and plain that by the unauthorized improper fallacious and perverse construction of the sherinan law of july 14 1890 first given by secretary foster in october 1891 and afterwards concurred in and adhered to by secretary carlisle these officials made it easy inviting and profitable to the gold speculators bond syndicates and nationalbank promoters to raid the treasury and deplete the gold reserve at pleasure how often they did so and with what accursed effect i need not consume the time to tell it were better for us to address ourselves with earnestness and judgment to the speedy correction of that which is so fraught with ruin and disaster as is the sherman law as now construed rather than waste our time in criticising flagrant wrongs we have no power to undo the plutocrats have been extremely vigilant watchful and eager to seize upon any advantage presented and to ingeniously plan and adroitly execute the shrewdest schemes that human intelligence can conceive by which to accelerate the adoption of a financial system that would enable them to arbitrarily control the volume of money to be circulated in this country at any given time the interpretation of the sherman law that transferred the option from the secretary of the treasury to the holder of the treasury notes to de termine whether they should be redeemed in gold or silver was the very consummation of all that the financial vultures of this country had wished and hoped for through the years of conflict and struggle waged between them and the people by it the greedy and selfish were promoted to the distinguished service of dictating to the government the course to be pursued in matters that involved not only the welfare of the government but likewise the fortunes the happiness and the destiny of the american people by it these remorseless producers of panics and despoilers of government credit have been vested with a function that should be performed by the chosen agent of the government only because it carries with it the possibiityand when wielded by one exempt from responsibility the probabilityof fastening upon them unlimited indebtedness and all that that implies when its payment can be enforced through the harsh and exacting processes of taxation it ought not and i am persuaded will not be a difficult matter for any citizen to understand and appreciate the imminentand if not provided against the certaindanger to both the government and people from this source within the thirty months last past there have transpired events sufficient to convince the most incredulous that unless there shall be some change made by which the raids on the gold reserve of the treasury and the resulting bond issues shall be made impossible then inevitable and speedy bankruptcy awaits both the government and country alike there is a remedy plain and simple to provide which would be a brief and easy task and why there should be delay or hesitancy in its application is not understood on this side of the chamber but perhaps well known to those on he other side if this congress will so amend the sherman law as to make it mandatory on the secretary to himself elect whether he will redeem the sherman treasury notes in gold or silver there will never be from that hour henceforth another one of those disgraceful predatory occurrences for which the government has been compelled to deliver its bonds for 262 000 000 in little more han two years past without this or some equivalent legislation these repeated bond issues so easily and successfully manipulated will continue to be the star attraction in american finances but it is claimed by its friends that this measure when put into operation will revolutionize the prevalent depressed state of business affairs that in some mysterious and inexplicable manner it will supply all the arteries of commercial life with a richer and more abundant blood and vivify and regenerate the dead and languishing industries of the country in the providence of god i trust it will but in the weakness of my mental perception i am unable to see how and why it will be competent to bring the blessings prophesied of it if i could be made to see that it would fulfill the apparent expectation of its advocates i would go quickly to its jupport and so far as my effort could achieve it would hasten the gay and the hour when my country would enjoy the fruition of the wise and faithful service that led to its adoption but no profusion of bold and eloquent declarations and bald and unsustained assertions can induce me to acquiesce in that which is contrary to reason and contradicted by experience contrary to reason because the spontaneous promptings of the most fragile intellect are war with and the irrefragible logic of every strong and wellleveloped mind condemns and refutes the conclusion that a people can be enriched by filching from them through the medium of vnjust taxation an undue part of the scanty rewards for their labors the irrefutable effect of the pending measure to the consumer be to advance over and above the cost of the manufacture plus a fair commercial profit the price of every article upon which it imposes a tariff and of which this country does not produce more than it consumes if it does not enable the manufacturer of such goods to charge the people more than he otherwise could it will be no only futile but actually exasperating to him if it does it wiln hot merely fail to benefit but will be an indefensible outrage upon them the consumer who can not now buy an article the price of which is 1 will scarcely be able to purchase it when the price has been by this measure forced up to 2 without increasing his income if this bill does not add to the price of manufactured articles it can not help the manufacturer and if it does increase the price the people will be less able to buy here you have the two horns of the dilemma lay hold on whichever you choose and you are no nearer to the solution of the serious problem of relief to the country than if you had grasped the other or neither the republicans have with arrogance and vehemence proclaimed during this debate that the present conditions were due to the wilson bill it is very gratifying to have them abandon their usual policy of talking about everything in general and nothing in particular and give the country in explicit terms their diagnosis of the case here is a patient sick almost unto death and upon its representation that it thoroughly understood the nature and cause of the disease and could and would administer an infallible remedy the republican party has been placed in charge its leaders upon this floor pronounce the malady to be low prices superinduced by the present tariff law democratic leaders concur in the opinion that low prices is the cankerous disease that is now so rapidly destroying the vitality of the afflicted but makes the issue that the cause assigned is not the correct one sharp concise and emphatic if it shall appear that they have incorrectly diagnosed the case then their proposed remedy can not be a cure in this matter to remove the cause is to make a cure and they can not remove a cause of which they do not know if as contended by the republicans the prevailing low prices were the necessary sequence of the tariff law now in force then the unfailing remedy lies in the repeal of that law if they were not it is folly and nonsense to say that the repeal of that law and the substitution of this will accomplish the work of restitution now to assert as they do that the wilson bill was and is the operating cause in the decline in the general level of prices is in substance to affirm that prices did not begin to fall until it became a law the official records it will be admitted must be considered the most reliable and most impartial testimony that can be adduced touching this issue the most of such as will be referred to by me were made up years before this issue had been joined and were the work of those in sympathy not with my views but with those entertained by the other side hence being in effect admissions by our antagonists sh ouldbe given more influence on the hearing of the issue if these records do not show to the exclusion of reasonable doubt that the general level of prices had been falling longanterior to the enactment of the present law then all candid men will agree that the republican position is correct but if on the other hand they show with unerring certainty that prices have been falling for nearly twentyfive years then the selfrespecting statesman must and will yield the issue and whether he does or not the people will in due season ascertain the right and demand its recognition by those chosen to serve them keeping in mind the issue i invite your attention to the following official figures showing the range of prices of some of our leading products for several years just past bushels value the yield of corn per acre averaged in1 181 20 7 13 40 1875 295 12 80 1891 11 4 8 86 1895 2 2 6 91 in no year intervening between the first and last here given

above that quoted for the former year or with the exception of 1894 fall below that given for 1895 a citation of statistics relative to other commodities would be merely cumulative evidence of the facts so well established by those already given but at the risk of being thought tedious i venture to give a few more figures which indicate the direful consequences of falling prices from 1880 to 1890 to the farmers of the united states the number of realestate mortgages executed in the unitd states in 1880 was 643 143 amounting to 710 888 504 the number of realestate mortgages executed in the united states in 1889 was 1 226 323 amounting to 1 752 568 274 percentage of increase in number in 1889 over 1880 was 90 68 percentage of increase in amount of those of 1889 over those of 1880 was 146 53 the records also show that for each year subsequent to 1880 such mortgages increased in both number and amount over those of the preceding year thus showing that the chains of financial bondage with which the people have been shackled for years were being constantly drawn closer and yet this was during a decade when an ideal republican tariff prevailed the number of realestate mortgages in force january 1 1890 was 4 777 698 amounting to 6 019 679 985 and the annual interest charged thereon amounted to 397 442 792 taking the period from 1850 to 1890 the increase in number of farmers frot 1880 to 1890 was smaller than in any other decade the increase in improved lands from 1880 to 1890 was but slightly more than onehalf of that from 1850 to 1860 and from 1870 to 1880 the enhancement in valuation of farm lands from 1850 to 1860 was 103 11 per cent while it was but 30 23 per cent from 1880 to 1890 the number of farms cultivated by owners increased from 1880 to 1890 but 9 56 per cent while those cultivated by tenants increased 60 69 per cent comment upon these figures can not emphasize the painful and indelible truth they so plainly and so accurately portray in the lucent flashes which they emit no one can fail to catch the glimpses of the frightful havoc and desolation with which falling prices have strewn the land stagnation and depression rule with despotic sway in every department of business life able enterprising and cautious men have been swept into the vortex of hopeless and irretrievable insolvency want and penury are visible in the faces of countless thousands who wander up and down the streets of i he great metropolitan cities in search of ema loyment that can not be had at any price and in numberleqq omes erstwhile radiant with the glow of success and content ment there is now the somber hues of discontentment and destittion the bounteors crops of the farmers the bone and sinew q the republic instead of smiling with the gentle assurances of fait reward to them who have through sunshine and shower narture4 and developed them are now heaving with sighs of disappointment and vocal with the moans of despair and in short the deepening shadows of a longcontinued but ever more furious financial storm still hove over and around the great masses of our pop4 ulation the supremest duty as well as the most patriotic work this congress can perform is

liberality of motives and freedom of action that i assume for myself i want to say that i would yield all my highest ambitions and loltiest aspirations if thereby i could dismantle the plutocrat of the panoply of favoritism he has under the law and sever in twain the galling golden cord with which they have shackled the sons of tol the official references given show that notwithstanding the tariff laws have been varied thd fall in prices have been constant and unrelenting it is as impossible to reinstate the former level of prices by the enactment of this measure as it is to enter the pearly gates of the new jerusalem by the commission of the unpardonable sin i brand it as i delusion and denounce it as a premeditated confiscation of th6 property of the many for the benefit of the

to pay the soldiers who are already volunteering in response to the presidents call this country instead of going forward to glorious victory would be compelled ingloriously and at once to surrender all for which its land and naval forces have already been called into action some gentlemen upon that side of the chamber seem determined to destroy the credit of the government by compelling the use of fiat money to bring about that result they have opposed every reasonable method which has been suggested for the raising of the sinews of war the gentleman from south dakota i think it was who endeavored this evening to make it appear that this bill is framed in the interest of the rich as against the poor he stated boldly that it imposed a tax upon the beer of the poor man and none whatever upon the wine of the rich man the rich will drink more of the beer and pay more of the beer tax than will the poor the tax however will fall upon the brewer and not upon the consumer a glass of beer will still be sold for 5 cents the silver dollar in front of his eye so obscured and shortened his visual range that he seemed absolutely unable to read that provision found on page 41 wherein wines of every kind are directly and distinctly taxed to an amount equal to 4 90 as against 2 upon beer and he utterly forgets that wines are already taxed ten times as heavily as beer why even watermineral water the table water of the richis taxed at a higher rate than beer and who let me ask will pay the stamp tax imposed in schedule a upon bonds and debentures certificates of stock in corporations and on all transfers of shares of stock in corporations who will pay the stamp tax upon bank checks drafts certificates of deposit bills of exchange letters of credit brokers notes memoranda of sales of stocks upon exchanges notes of hand etc and who will pay the tax upon telegraphic and telephonic messages the tax upon corporate mortgages warehouse receipts and all the other various items found in schedule a which according to the estimate of the distinguished chairman of the ways and means committee will produce more revenue than any other section in the bill these taxes will be paid by persons of wealth or at least by persons who are well to do they are not the character of taxes which will fall upon the toiler in the mines nor in the workshop nor upon the railroad nor at the plow the bulk of these taxes will be paid by people of means the gentleman from ohio also endeavors to make it appear contrary to the fact that champagne is treated more tenderly than beer if he will offer an amendment providing that every man who drinks a bottle of champagne shall pay a war tax of 1 i will support it and in that particular will give him credit for the greater degree of patriotism because i think that he will pay a great deal more of the champagne tax than i will one gentleman who spoke this evening opposed a tax of 1 cent on telegraph messages because it might happen that some poor man sending a telegram to his dying mother might have to pay that cent statistics show that ninetenths of all the people of the united states do not send telegraphic messages at all or at least very rarely the other tenth who do send them are merchants brokers bankers corporations and business men generally and the same is true of express packages no form of tax that could be devised would fall more lightly upon the poor than the taxes proposed in this bill upon the business of express companies telegraph companies and longdistance telephone companies gentlemen with the silver dollar before their eyes are unable to see the advantages of this form of taxation they oppose the proposition to raise part of the war revenues from such sources and part from bonds and what do they propose instead why a tax on incomes i am not here at such a time to object to such a tax if it could be collected but the supreme court of the united states has already declared it to be unconstitutional gentlemen upon the other side have clamored for war in season and out of season they endeavored to force the country into war when we were without ships without guns without ammunition and without adequate coast defenses they endeavored to force us into war without first exhausting the diplomatic means which modern civilization requires shall first be exhausted in an effort to avert armed hostilities they endeavored to drive the country into war at such time upon such pretext and in such manner as would have condemned our action in the eyes of nations other than spain and have embroiled us in difficulties with them the gentleman from ohio in particular demanded instant war and scurrilously and outrageously abused and vilified president mckinley and charged him with the basest motives in his endeavors to avert war and to maintain peace with honor now that war has come how do the gentleman from ohio and others upon that side propose to pay the expense why by reenacting a statute that has already been declared invalid and under which not a dollar of revenue has been or can be raised but gentlemen say the supreme court of the united states was wrong in its decision the constitution of the united states provides that congress may not levy direct taxes except in proportion to the population gentlemen say that that is unfair because the population in pennsylvania may be wealthier per capita than the population in some other states their quarrel is with the constitution congress has no power to set that instrument aside the supreme court held among other things in the incometax cases that a tax upon the incomes derived from land for instance is practically a direct tax upon the land and therefore prohibited by the constitution the gentleman from texas the democratic leader spent nearly an hour yesterday in an endeavor to show that when rent has reached the pocket of the land owner it is no longer land or real estate but is money and therefore may be taxed similar sophistry was indulged in by learned counsel in the famous passenger cases reported in 7 howard the tax in question was imposed nominally upon the passengers but the court held that it was a tax upon the vessel mr justice grier who delivered the opinion said we have to deal with things as we find them and we can not change them by changing their names can a state levy a duty on vessels engaged in commerce and not owned by her own citizens by changing its name from a duty on tonnage to a tax on the master or an impost upon imports by calling it a charge on the owner or supercargo and justify this evasion of a great principle by producing a dictionary or a dictum to prove that a ship captain is not a vessel nor a supercargo an import many years ago the state of california levied a tax upon bills of lading for the shipment of gold or silver out of the state the supreme court of the united states held in almy vs state of california 24 howard 169 that although nominally upon the bill of lading it was in substance a tax upon the thing exported and therefore void chief justice taney who delivered the opinion said a tax or duty on a bill of lading although differing in form from a duty on the article shipped is in substance the same thing in the more recent case of the philadelphia and southern mail steamship company vs commonwealth of pennsylvania 122 u s 326 the same courtdecided that a tax upon gross receipts derived from interstate or international commerce was a tax upon the commerce itself in commonwealth of pennsylvania vs western union telegraph company a case which i had the honor to argue chief justice fuller delivered his first opinion after appointment to the bench in support of the proposition that a tax upon receipts derived from interstate telegraph messages was in effect a tax upon the messages themselves in the famous case of the state tax on foreignheld bonds reported in 15 wallace at page 300 reversing the supreme court of pennsylvania the supreme court of the united states held that a tax of 5 per cent imposed upon the interest upon corporate bonds was in substance a tax upon the bonds themselves and therefore invalid as applied to bonds held by nonresidents upon this point the decision of the court in the income tax was in harmony with its previous rulings and with common sense if you tax a man upon the rent derived from his farm because so derived or if you tax him upon all the wheat raised upon a certain farm because raised upon that farm you will have difficulty in convincing him that his farm has not been made the subject of taxation the gentleman from texas admitted thatincome derived from the interest upon a municipal bond is a tax upon the bond itself how then can he argue that income which consists of rent from a farm is not a tax upon the farm itself but we are told there have been changes on the supreme bench which now contains two justices who did not participate in the former decision and that possibly upon a rehearing under a newstatute the court might come to a different conclusion they propose therefore to reenact that tax and rest the success of our armies and navies upon the hazard that the immutable principles of law may be changed or that the supreme court may change its mind they propose to say to our brave soldiers and sailors go ahead and fight and we will pay you when the supreme court of the united states reverses itself there is no assurance and indeed no prospect of any such reversal and it would in any event take the greater part of a year to get a test case into that court for its decision that is the way the gentleman from missouri intends that we shall pay as we go gentlemen who voted freely to issue 4 per cent bonds in time of peace will now vote against 3 per cent bonds to meet the exigencies of war unless they are made payable in silver how would that work who would buy the bonds and what would we get for them if you want an example of the freesilver theory as a plied to government indebtedness turn to mexico upon every mexican bond held by a nonresident that government has to pay in interest the equivalent of 12 in silver upon every hundred of principal we propose to borrow money at 3 per cent and to do it by making it payable principal and interest in money which shall be kept as good as gold we propose to make this a popular loan the bonds are to be for 25 or multiples thereof so that all the people may be taken into the partnership and have an interest in the government and in the war the silver question before the eye of the opposition so blinds their judgment to all the dictates of patriotism statesmanship or even common business sense that they oppose this proposition and propose to destroy the credit of the government make its bonds utterly unsalable and prevent it from raising the necessary funds by making them payable in silver or else defeating the issue entirely and this they call paying as we go this country after four years of hardship and distress was fairly entered upon a course of unexampled prosperity i was not one of those who sought to drive our people from the downy bed of prosperity to the flinty and steel couch of war war with its sad concomitants of debt taxation devastation and death i was one of those who voted and who labored in season and out of season to sustain the president in his patriotic efforts to accomplish without recourse to arms all that humanity and a just regard for the dignity and honor of our flag required should be accomplished voted for the house cuban resolution because it left still an opportunity for an honorable peaceful solution which i hoped almost against hope might yet be accomplished i voted against the senate resolution because it would have closed the door utterly to further diplomatic negotiations and because it proposed to recognize as an independent government entitled to a place and standing among the nations and governments of the earth the present socalled republican government in cuba i was opposed to such recognition because there is no stable and fixed government there to be recognized because president mckinley had advised against such recognition because in my judg ment the power of recognition is vested by the constitution in the president and not in congress and because such recognition would substantially have placed the army and navy and treasury of the united states at the service of a handful of men over in new york known as the cuban junta should we now recognize that as an existing government then in accordance with international law when our armies land upon cuban soil or our navies are in cuban waters they must fight under the cuban flag and be under the direction of cuban officers our own gallant commander majorgeneral miles the hero of a hundred battles with brooke and merritt and lee and wheeler or whomsoever may command our forces in cuba must serve under direction of gomez who brave though lie may be has never in his life handled as many as a thousand men in one engagement i opposed such recognition because if treated as an independent government the ten or a dozen men who control the affairs of cuba might at any time conclude on their own account a treaty of peace with any other nation or even with spain herself whereby the united states would be left entirely out in the cold and be placed in a very equivocal condition diplomatically and otherwise even france when she recognized our independence in the war of the revolution insisted upon a previous agreement that we would not make peace with england without her consent and aprm 27 yet it was proposed absolutely and without condition to recognize and treat as an independent sovereignty a goverment which consulgeneral lee testified before the senate committee was nothing except the skeleton form of a governmenta movable capital a capital which according to the testimony of a cuban officer consisted of three houses and eight inhabitants the controlling spirits of that government residing in the city of new york this testimony of general lee was given april 12 1898 before the senate committee it ought to have put an end at once to any thought of such recognition but the gallant general was too popular his reception by the country upon his return from cuba was too much in the nature of an ovation his name was even suggested as apossible democratic nominee for the presidency that did not suit william j bryan and the free silverites and so it happened that at a banquet held in this city on the evening of the l8th of april at which leading senators and members were present mr bryan declared that that government ought to be recognized and after a speech by my friend the gentleman from arkmnsas and upon a motion put byhim it was unanimously resolved that those present at the banquet representing as it was claimed 000 000 voters who supported bryan and the freesilver cause should insist upon the senate resolution and thus some senators who otherwise would have opposed it iere brought to its support but happily we were enabled to defeat that clause and now that we must fight we will fight in cuban waters and upon cuban soil under our own beautiful and glorious bauner and under the direction of our own commanders and when we have accomplished the noble purposes for which we fight we shall be in position to make peace upon our own terms american citizens have been confined in spanish prisons without cause and indignities have been heaped upon others our officers and representatives have been treated with scant courtesy the property of american citizens upon the island of cuba has been destroyed without compensation our trade has suffered our commerce has been injured we have been compelled for a long time to keep men and ships constantly employed at great expense to our government to prevent american citizens from aiding the cuban insurgents in violation of neutrality laws our humane efforts to feed the starving on the island of cuba exasperated the spanish people the irritation increased until finally on the night of the 15th of february while our batfe ship maine was lying peacefully at anchor at a buoy designated by the spanish authorities 258 american seamn and officers sleeping under the american flag in a supposed friendly port were by the explosion of a submarine mine hurled instantly into eternity and the costliest and most perfect war ship the world has ever seen the pride of the american navy was sent a tangled mass of wreckage to the bottom of the foul harbor of havana with a patience for which they deserve inexpressible credit the american people stunned and shocked as they were by this awful crime awaited patiently the result of a judicial investigation but before it was received they were still further appalled by authentic reports and detailed narratives of crimes committed by or in the name of the spanish government upon innocent noncombatants mostly women and children upon the island of cuba almost under the shadow of the stars and stripes which for coldblooded and hellish ingenuity of planning success in execution and extent of resultant suffering and death exceeded anything of which the present generation has ever heard or read think of 200 o00 deliberately herded together like cattle prevented from obtaining the necessities of life and doomed to die by slow starvation mere than 50 per cent of their number having already thus p erished the food contributed by charitable americans or purchased by money appropriated by the american congress the reconcentrados were not permitted to cook because they were not permitted to obtain the necessary fuel the reports of our consuls showed such a frightful state of facts that our governent for a time withheld them from publication until they were verified from other sources when the report of the court of inquiry upon the maine disaster was made known and the people became gradually acquainted with these further crimes against humanity there came swelling and surging up to congress the voice of seventy millions of indignant and outraged american citizens demanding action in response to the demand of the president of the united states the spanish order of reconcentration was nominally revoked and yet the reconcentrados were not permitted to depart the spanish cortes pretended to appropriate a large number of pesetas equal to 600 000 to their support hut not a peseta ever reached them these facts and the discovery of the de l~me letter showed the duplicity and the insincerity of spanish dealing and spanish promises then the president of the united states demanded that the spanish troops should be withdrawn from cuba and the people of that island be permitted to take care of themselves the only reply was the recall of the spanish minister from washington and the discharge by the spanish government of the american minister at madrid thus were all negotiations ended between the two countries the maine is unavenged and unapologized for the same revolting crimes against humanity are continued in cuba and every possible insult has been heaped upon our people who have borne much and suffered long and so it came about that both houses of congress unanimously declared war and that war has existed since spain literally threw in the face of the american people the ultimatum which the president by order of congress had sent for her consideration the patriotism of the american people is stirred to the highest pitch the different parts of the country vie with each other in patriotic offerings it is a magnificent spectaclethat of this reunited country men who wore the blue and men who wore the gray in deadly combat against each other now march shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy the services of brave and gallant generals of the late confederacy are freely offered to the government and i hope may be accepted it is the duty of the government and the desire of the people to bring this war to a glorious and triumphant end as speedily as possible to accomplish that purpose large sums of money are necessary and must be raised quickly the people demand this and they will not be slow to punish those who for the hope of gaining some slight party
