right of free speech has not been suppressed hence i make bold to say i am opposed to peacetime conscription because i believe it to be the very negation of democracy it is the beginning of the end as the previous speaker who just left the floor well said it is the beginning of the conscription of labor the beginning of the conscription of capital i am not for the conscription of capital or men in a democracy but if we are going to conscript flesh and blood we dare not refuse to conscript industry and wealth i believe we can get a voluntary military system in this country without resorting to a draft of american youth and i am not afraid of the hysteria that is going throughout the countrywell organized by warmongersthat some bogeyman is coming to invade america within the next few days or weeks based upon that hypothesis i do not go along with the advocates of this measure any more than i would go along if somebody rose in the well of this house and said we had better cover up the dome of the capitol tonight a meteor is going to fall and crush this building the same propaganda was used in 1916 and 1917 preceding our entrance into the last world war then they told us that the kaiser was the beast of berlin he had the undersea power to reach america by submarine warfare they quoted what he said that he was going to impose upon the entire world the germanic philosophy and said we had to be prepared great britain built up a great propaganda agency and spent 75 000 000 in the united states to subsidize the american press have we forgotten the activities of lord northcliffe they did not use the radio then as it is being used now nor the motionpicture screen as we know through recent developments the propaganda war films but they finally got us in the sum total of our participation in the world war was approximately 100 000 dead american boys fifteen or twenty billions of war debts still unpaid and approximately 345 000 boys in hospitals today or receiving medical treatment and the world got out of it as some speaker said tonight a hitler a mussolini and a stalin offsprings of british imperialism thank god there is no staini on our escutcheon the government of the united states refused to ratify the treaty of versailles that brought about this second world war we were present at the treatymaking conference through our representatives but the country said no when the united states senate refused to ratify such an infamous document back in the days of the first world war they did things in reverse from what they do these days they declared war firstthey had the courage to do that back in 1917and conscripted manpower later a new system is invoked todayconscript manpower first war comes along without a declaration we are starting to imitate the dictator nations of europe and asia they do not declare wars any more they are all undeclared wars and so we in reverse put in conscription first i am here now to say in my humble opinion that it will not need a war declaration to send our boys across the ocean the congress may just as well go home in the light of events taking place daily in official washington there is no mistake about it we are no longer neutral war is just around the corner this conscription bill is step no 4 toward war i was bold enough in may of 1939 to make the statement on the floor of the house when i protested the official visit of the british king and queen that only imperialistic britain could get us into another world war i know that some of my colleagues facetiously said at that because of his ancestors or because of his lineage he is twisting the lions tail my home and my birthplace is the united states of america i am concerned with the welfare of my country over that of any other nation on earth i was fearful of great brtiain more than any other nation in the world because great britain did bring us into the last world war the perfidy of our british ambassador walter hines page and the propaganda of lord northcliffe brought us into that bloody holocaust to make the world safe for democracy that is what i was thinking about when i warned against official visits of foreign rulers i did not want to see a repetition of 1917 and 1918 in my lifetime i said that the first step toward war would be when you received officially the british king and queen in june of 1939 oh many of you innocently went over there under the capitol dome graciously to shake the hand of his majesty and her majesty not knowing that you were then stepping into the war making the first step you took the second step when we were called into special session last fall when our neutrality laws went out the window and you lifted the arms embargo to aid the synthetic democracies of britain and france the third step was taken yesterday by the president of the united states without your consent you the people you the representatives of the people when he traded 50 of our destroyers for some leaseholds

they make their recommendations by stating that a certain amount of money can be profitably expended over a certain period on a certain program or project that is the form in which all of their recommendations are made as i say they recommended the expenditure of 206 000 000 to carry on the national floodcontrol problem for the year 1941 and the budget cut that amount down to 70 000 000 now with this kind of drastic reduction if it should be continued in subsequent years the floodcontrol program of the united states will be strung out indefinitely and i think the tendency of this administration to cut down year by year on flood control as well as on rivers and harbors improvement must be apparent to everyone i hope when this bill goes over to the senate we may be able to get an increase in that appropriation there and if so when it comes back to the house i trust that all those interested in flood control will take a united stand in support of a motion to concur in the senate amendment i am sure i do not need to tell any member of this body about the importance or the necessity of the value of flood control you are all familiar with that i will say merely that in the opinion of people generally both in the congress and throughout the country there is no more valuable federal activity than the effective control of the floods in our major streams there is no activity that is more in need of immediate and effective prosecution at this time you are familiar with that and with the reasons why that is so it is my opinion that we ought to prosecute the program in accordance with the plans already authorized by law and that we can do that and practice rigid economy at the same time two years ago the flood control committees of the house and senate mapped out a comprehensive national program for flood control that program which is embraced in the 1938 flood control act is composed of certain projects which up to that time had been approved by the board of army engineers and submitted to the congress through the secretary of war out of these individual authorized projects the flood control committee made its national program with the view of solving the problem of flood control for the whole country and the congress in adopting this program declared its intention of carrying out the plan in accordance with the authorization act the 1938 act of course did not include all the projects which had been approved by the board of engineers and reported to the congress it included only about onethird of those projects the reason the flood control committee limited its program to its present scope was because it believed that if it confined itself to a comparatively small program it could make a definite beginning on each of the projects authorized in the act and that it could complete all of those projects within the space of 5 years now you will remember that it was at the request of the president that the committee limited its authorized program to onethird of what the committee first intended and it was thoroughly understood by all of us that funds were to be provided to make a start upon and to continue the limited program and to complete it in 5 years but after we passed the 1938 bill and after the board of army engineers had made its estimates for the first years work the budget bureau made a drastic slash in the amount recommended by the engineers the budget cut it practically in two the result was that in the last year we were not able to get a proper start on floodcontrol program at all about half the projects authorized in the 1938 act have not even been begun and the engineers were obliged to use all the money appropriated to make even a fair beginning on the few that are now under way they hoped this year they could get the rest of them started but to the amazement of everybody the budget estimates for 1941 were cut down to less than half of the 1940 appropriation at this rate new projects will never get started and the comprehensive program authorized by the congress will thus be defeated i think this particular field is the wrong place to commence the economy program everybody is aware how and where an economy program should start it should start by cutting those activities of the government which are practically worthless it is there that economy should start and if you cut deep enough into these worthless activities you will not have to interfere with the legitimate activities of the government hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved by eliminating these worthless activities altogether

livelihood for his loved ones faced with a desperate situation and a problem that permits no easy solution it is evident to any fairthinking individual that such citizens with growing children cannot properly provide and raise a family on 39 monthly we have no greater authority for such a statement than the bureau of home economics of the united states department of agriculture who from the consumers purchases study conducted by them points out that any family whose average size is 3 3 persons requires an annual income of 750 a year from the bare necessities of life it is further stated by the bureau of home economics that families who have an income of less than 750 annually are not only denied a bare living but from their low income are face to face with the fact that rent food fuel light and medical care require 704 alone therefore on an income of less than 750 they do not break even but in truth face a deficit it should be borne in mind that with few exceptions this 39 monthly wage scale is decreased on an average of 4 monthly due to the worker having to pay his own transportation cost to and from the project another evil of the ruthless reduction in wages is the discrimination between adjoining counties in the maintaining of a different wage scale when it is an undisputed fact that rent clothing and food supplies are identical in price in these various communities how can any reasonable man answer a w p a employee receiving 39 a month when across the county line his fellow w p a worker receives 42 90 and both men deal at the same store and pay the same price for a pound of butter or a peck of potatoes i know some of you say that the w p a rolls are filled with people who are always unemployed in good or bad times but i refuse to permit indictment of the vast number of worthy citizens who from the effects of widespread economic conditions find it necessary to accept employment on the w p a in order to secure a livelihood i know too that some of you will say if the w p a worker receiving 39 monthly is returned to the former wage scale of 53 30 monthly the increased cost will result in a reduction of jobs but let me remind you a moment ago my colleague from pennsylvania offered an amendment that would have increased the 975 650 000 to 1 125 000 000 and the increase was more than sufficient to cover any increase necessary in restoring the old wage scale in effect prior to september 1 1939 in spite of this effort to increase the amount for next year when a vote was taken on the ditter amendment let me emphasize this fact not one democratic member of this house voted for the amendment in other words they defeated our efforts to increase the wages of the w p a worker now in all seriousness gentlemen the fenton amendment now being considered offers another opportunity to grant an increase to the w p a worker and thereby correct the abuses that have been heaped upon this class of worthy citizens last year i vigorously opposed the tarver amendment which resulted in the unjust wage reduction in effect the past year in considering this years bill i am supporting every amendment that will increase the present wage scale and i propose to continue my action in simple justice to the thousands of w p a workers who have been the victims of such rank discrimination"], [0.9221428632736206, 0.9221428632736206, 0, "the railroad unemployment insurance act was enacted in 1938 the provisions contained in the original bill were more or less speculative with respect to the total amount of income that would be received under its provisions from the railroads for support of the fund and likewise uncertain was the amount that would be required to be paid out to employees as benefits under the terms of the act in other words the whole plan was experimental in character it was necessarily so because there was no definite factual information available upon which reliance could be placed that would enable anyone to assume that changes would not be possible or necessary in the future based upon the experience to be gained in the operation of the plan fifteen months have now elapsed since the enactment of the legislation during this time certain trends and conditions have been observed that seemed to require consideration and change to the end that the act might be improved from the standpoint of administration and likewise to make available more adequate benefits to the employees the operation of the fund has demonstrated that the 3percent tax paid by the railroads produces an income in excess of the amount that is necessary to pay the benefits that accrued to unemployed railroad employees under the rates and conditions contained in the bill the amount of the surplus now in the fund is variously estimated up to as high as 150 000 000 while there may be some dispute as to what can properly be considered as the amount of the surplus yet in any case it is a sizable sum there is no dispute however that the present tax rate of 3 percent will in all probability at all times produce an amount greatly in excess of what will be necessary to make the necessary benefit payments to the employees under the rates now in effect thus a question of policy now presents itself namely whether the tax should be reduced and thereby the income decreased to a point that more nearly approximates the amount necessary to pay the benefits now provided for by the act or should the tax remain at the present level and the benefits to employees be increased to a point that would be justified on the basis of present income or should there be an intermediate point agreed upon that would enable a reduction of the rate to be paid by the railroads which at the same time would not prevent an increase of benefits to the employees all of the possible solutions as above enumerated were considered by the committee on interstate and foreign commerce after hearing witnesses produced by both management and men and giving the matter careful and serious consideration the committee has reported the bill now under consideration the bill as reported adopts the premise that the tax as originally fixed should remain for at least the present and that the provisions of the original act should be amended to provide more adequate benefits to the employees in support of the action taken by the committee the testimony shows that a 3percent tax is the universal rate fixed by the legislation of the several states for the maintenance of industrial unemployment insurance funds the tax of 3 percent fixed by the railroad unemployment insurance act is therefore in accord with that paid by industry for similar purposes it may be that future experience might reveal that a decreased or graduated tax would be possible without destroying the benefits this bill now before the house seeks to give employees in such event of course further consideration can be given to the matter the basic theory of all such legislation is as it should be that the tax income should not exceed the amount necessary to provide adequate benefits to the employees and to provide solvency and stability for the fund under all the varying economic changes that come in the course of years with respect to the adequacy of benefits now being received by railroad employees under the provisions of the law as now in effect it would seem from the testimony presented to the committee that in some respects the provisions of state laws provided a better rate of compensation for unemployed industrial workers than the federal act provided for railroad workers to adjust what seemed to be inequities in this respect the committee has provided by this bill first an increase in daily rate of benefits second increase in the number of days of compensable unemployment in each registration period third increase in the number of days of benefit to be paid in the benefit year and fourth reduction in the waiting period requirements the time at my disposal in the limited debate that is possible under the rules of the house precludes my giving in detail the respective changes suffice it to say however they do provide a substantial increase of benefits to unemployed railroad workers and at the same time the solvency and adequacy of the fund are preserved the committee has also recommended administrative changes that it is believed will prove beneficial to all parties in interest it is unnecessary to give any further explanation of such than has already been given and as appears in the committee report whatever additional changes may be necessary or advisable with respect to the tax to be paid by the railroad benefits to be received by the employees or in the administrative features of the act will depend upon the experience gained in the operation of the fund upon the basis of the changes now made it can be certainly said that the original railroad unemployment insurance act is greatly improved by the changes provided for in this bill and the purpose and interest of that act to provide compensation to unemployed railroad workers is greatly strengthened i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr

no surrender of the constitutional powers of this congress we merely declare our intention our policies and our principles and it is up to the chief executive then to carry out what we have given him and that will be done thoughtful people are worried about the centralization of power here in washington and i share their concern i believe we have centralized too much power in the hands of the president but we should attack that condition by taking away some of the power which we have delegated in the handling of our domestic affairs and not commence by usurping a constitutional authority which every president has enjoyed since the beginning of our history the president of the united states by the authority which is delegated to him under the constitution is commander in chief of the

ambassadors and two ministers namely the ambassador in berlin the ambassador in poland the minister in austria and the minister in czechoslovakia but by not sending the ambassador back to berlin this

receive information which it is most necessary at this time for them to receive we had the same opportunity to withdraw our ambassador from japan when incidents occurred there but we did not and it would be a most serious matter at this time under conditions that exist in europe for the united states government to withdraw its ambassador from any country in europe finland would in no way be strengthened if relations with the soviet government were to be broken off at this time and the advocates of severance of relations with soviet russia who believe that such an act would help finland are illadvised the president as you know during last december in most forceful terms gave expression of the attitude of the government and the people of this country toward the invasion of finland by the soviet army the president on that occasion issued the following statement the news of the soviet naval and military bombings within finnish territory has come as a profound shock to the government and people of the united states despite efforts made to solve the dispute by peaceful methods to which no reasonable objection could be offered one power has chosen to resort to force of arms it is tragic to see the policy of force spreading and to realize that wanton disregard for law is still on the march all peaceloving peoples in those nations that are still hoping for the continuance of relations throughout the world on the basis of law and order will unanimously condemn this new resort to military force as the arbiter of international differences it would be poor policy indeed to establish the principle that the maintenance of diplomatic relations with another government implies approval of the form of government of that country or of the actions and policies of the government of that country if that were the case it would appear to be necessary to consider the advisability of discontinuing diplomatic relations with several other governments now pursuing policies and objectives which the government and the people of the united states do not approve it is more necessary to have diplomatic relations with a foreign country during tense periods than it is in times of international harmony this is particularly true under the conditions which exist today in fact the presence of ambassadors or ministers becomes more essential in these times for the protection of american citizens and property it must be remembered furthermore that no other country has broken off diplomatic relations with soviet russia during this critical period the british and the french governments have not broken off diplomatic relations with soviet russia and have not withdrawn their ambassadors from moscow it should be the policy of the united states to maintain peaceful relations with all countries throughout the world and the breaking off of relations with russia would not be in conformity with our policy to maintain such peaceful relations because you must remember that when diplomatic relations are severed between other countries and the united states we lose the opportunity to discuss and deal directly on questions that may arise in this way the absence of official

would always be a member of the house so solid and enduring seemed his personality he seemed a part of the landscape in some men there is that substantial quality that gives them weight power and influence without any of the tricks and artifices of eloquence or magnetic attraction mr mapes belonged to the rare and segregated few who depend upon the power and weight of their logic rather than upon their frenzied declamation he cared little or nothing for mere show and glitter in fact he was so equipped with the substantial qualities of mind and transparent sincerity that he lived above the fog of rhetoric and the haze of mere words these qualities gave him a reputation for sincerity and honesty and honor not excelled by any member upon this floor since i have been a member of the house
