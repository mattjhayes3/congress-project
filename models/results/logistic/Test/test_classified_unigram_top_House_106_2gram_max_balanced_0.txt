accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio

this again we will be able to consider those provisions very carefully last night when the president vetoed the legislative and treasurypostal and general government appropriations bill he did more in my view than simply prolong the ongoing negotiations between the white house and the congress on the remaining appropriations measures he has jeopardized the funding that we have in this bill for our counterterrorism efforts funds to keep our borders safe programs to keep guns out of schools programs to trace guns in violent crimes the jobs of more than 150 000 federal employees including onethird of all federal law enforcement and he has jeopardized our nations war against drugs the president himself has stated that there is nothing wrong with the bill in its current form in fact he previously stated that after we made some changes changes that were included in the transportation appropriations bill he would sign this measure however he has now chosen to veto it because it funds the legislative branch and the white house at a time when the business of the american people remains unfinished he has failed to sign this perfectly good bill because of ongoing discussions relating to education funding and ergonomics issues that have nothing to do with the bill that he vetoed it seems to me that the presidents veto is more about making political statements than it is about making good public policy if we want to get the work of this congress done we have to take these bills one at a time the presidents veto message claims that these bills reflect self interest or special interests let us be clear about what the president is talking about here the treasury appropriations bill provides among other things these items 2 25 billion for the customs service including increases for expanded antiforced child labor money to attack drug smuggling groups and new agents and infrastructure for northern border security 467 000 for the national center for missing and exploited children including the use of forensic technologies to reunite families 62 million to expand the integrated violence reduction strategy a program to enforce the brady law to keep convicted felons from getting guns to investigate illegal firearms dealers and to join forces with state and local law enforcement and prosecutors to fully investigate and prosecutor offenders 25 million for nationwide comprehensive gun tracing and 185 million for our drug media campaign to reduce and prevent youth drug use this bill also includes 186 million for customs automation an item that importers have been clamoring for this bill provides funds to begin an immediate investment in our automated commercial environment program a system that will help us to efficiently enforce our trade laws and finally this bill includes 1 8 million in support of the secret services new initiative the national threat assessment center to help us identify and prevent youngsters that might commit violence in and around schools i do not see how the items i have just described here are special interest items these programs reflect the interests of all americans not just a few all of us have a stake in the safety of our borders all of us have a stake in the war on drugs and in keeping guns out of our schools on july 27 when the house passed this bill the administration indicated they had several concerns regarding proposed funding levels for different programs specifically they said that they felt they needed another 225 million for an additional 5 670 irs employees and they signalled that unless that was provided they would veto this measure so we sat down we negotiated in good faith with the white house the house the senate the republicans and the democrats on both sides of this congress on both sides of this aisle we added the funds for the irs it was not everything that the administration asked for but we also added other funds for other important programs after we did this socalled fix which the president signed into law as part of the transportation appropriations bill on october 23 we were told that the president would sign this bill indeed i might have thought that the comment that the president made yesterday at his press conference when he said again we have accomplished so much in this session of congress in a bipartisan fashion it has been one of the most productive sessions i might have thought that he was talking about our bill a bill he would have been preparing to sign obviously as the hour of midnight approached we found out that it was to be otherwise the presidents veto message says that he will not sign this bill until we fund our classrooms fix our schools protect our workers the president has once again moved the goalpost in regard to the treasury appropriations bill i am extremely disappointed that this administration has gone back on its word to sign this bill and has instead chosen to use it as a vehicle to hold congress hostage and make political statements regarding funding for education but we are here tonight with a vetoed bill and we are prepared to get this work done unfortunately i notice that the president of the united states is in louisville kentucky for a congressional candidate and then doing a fundraising event in new york city for the first lady how do we expect to get this work done when we are here and the president is out on the campaign trail i think it is a shame that the president has placed a higher value on the politics of education funding than he does on protecting our borders on fighting the war on drugs in keeping guns out of schools in countering terrorism the president has vetoed the bill that funds 100 percent of our nations border safety in order to make political points about a bill that funds 7 percent of our nations education funding this is a sad day this bill which has been worked on and a compromise has been reached and is a good bill for the agencies that we have under our jurisdiction it is sad that it is was vetoed i hope we can get a quick agreement with the administration on this i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california"], [0.00017148256301879883,

harvests come and go this one will certainly be one to remember unfortunately it is the low wheat prices that will not be forgotten wheat prices recently closed in goodland kansas at 1 96 a bushel the lowest price in over 30 years let me put this disaster in perspective in my state of kansas alone the loss in market value of the wheat crop will be over 500 million below last years dismal level let me restate that in one state in one crop the lost value is a half a billion dollars when compared to last years income nationwide the losses will be tremendous in kansas that is 500 million less that farmers have to pay bills and to take care of their families i do not know exactly what disaster relief legislation this year will look like but i must impress upon my fellow members of congress the seriousness of the circumstance and the ongoing damage to the agricultural economy this year there will be no crop with higher prices that comes to the rescue of the wheat farmer united states department of agriculture indicates that corn prices are at a 10year low and soybean prices are at a 27year low with both prices to decline further by the time of their fall harvest this problem however is not about numbers estimates or projections it is about people it is about the future of rural america and the survival of a generation of our farmers and ranchers i received a letter for example from my constituents that is pretty typical dear sir we are now beginning the 1999 wheat harvest in kansas the price of wheat here in ness county is 2 22 this is back in june as of close of markets on june 19 lower than we could sell wheat for in the troubled 80s prices of all our supplies seeds fertilizer et cetera have rose steadily since then and are still going up are farmers not supposed to have a decent living for all their hard work we as farmers have every right to just as good a living as most blue collar workers in this country someone senators representatives administration and agriculture secretary need to spend a little more time and effort to improve our circumstances most farmers have land payments coming due in august interest on them went up again payments of harvest expenses fuel repairs and labor all have to be paid 2 22 a bushel of wheat does not go very far to pay an 8 000 land payment and expect a living"], [0.0002187490463256836,

sense of the house resolution that targets aid and money to poor communities across this nation regarding the issue of separation of church and state if members oppose that american community renewal

their first year working together and i think they have done a very good job on this very important bill i want to thank them for all the money they gave to specific projects in the pacific northwest as the gentleman from washington did i want to register my concern however about two provisions included in this years energy and water appropriations act relating to the power marketing administrations i understand that the chairman has demonstrated willingness to clarify the language but i still have deep concerns about the implications unless the bill language is amended section 316 of the bill would limit the ability of the power marketing administrations to install fiberoptic cable it is my understanding that the bonneville power marketing administration is willing to develop a report to the subcommittee which would present their fiberoptic capacity needs projections construction and financing plans this provision in the bill limits the ability of the power marketing administrations from certain construction expansion or upgrades to dark fiberoptic telecommunication lines which are repaid by users i believe this provision is premature and unnecessary we should allow the pmas to complete ongoing projects and allow them to provide the congress with their view of the public benefits before we enact a legislative provision in this appropriations bill additionally section 317 prohibits the pmas from providing emergency transmission system maintenance and repair and reimbursable contract services to their customers which are provided by service utilities across the country this provision not only jeopardizes the safety and reliability of the vast transmission system owned by bonneville but also violates the federal energy regulatory commissions order 888 which states that the pmas in certain circumstances must provide transmission access and construction of additional facilities to neighboring utilities this section would prevent the bonneville power administration from directly funding the power operations and maintenance of the 29 federal columbia river power system dams which they are required to do under federal law the northwest power system cannot operate without these funds each of these sections in the bill is unworkable in its current form it is my great hope that both provisions can be removed and the pmas and the subcommittee can work together to address any concerns they may have i appreciate again all the help from the chairman he bent over backwards to help us and the gentleman from indiana has been very willing to help us as well we look forward to working with the gentleman in the conference on this issue"], [0.00036275386810302734, 0.500362753868103, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time i do think this debate is what is best about the house of representatives i think everyone who has spoken today is agreed on fundamental policy and that is kyoto has not been ratified it is not the law of the land and it should not therefore be implemented we have had a continuing debate as far as the language that has been included in a number of bills and i am very pleased that the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from massachusetts have worked out a compromise in the limited time i have i simply want to put this debate into perspective kyoto did not come from the vacuum of space it did not come from bill clintons mind the fact is it is a point on a continuum that began under the george bush administration pursuant to a treaty president bush signed on may 9 1992 that was ratified by the united states senate on october 7 of 1992 and the instrument of ratification was signed on october 13 that is where kyoto came from it is not implemented but there are discussions there are considerations taking place my concern about the language that has been included in a number of bills is that we would be placing qualitative and quantitative restrictions on thought on judgment on opinion and on the preexchange of information which in the end is to all of our benefit to make sure that that is not impeded i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts for offering his amendment i want to thank the gentleman from michigan for continuing to have an open mind on this issue hopefully all of us will be able to reach an appropriate compromise that allows
