act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of

stamps are one of the most visible and enduring ways that our nation honors organizations and people today the united states postal service will be celebrating the life and work of danny thomas with the commemorative stamp in my district of memphis tennessee at the st jude childrens research hospital danny thomas was born on january 6 1912 in deerfield michigan after saving enough money he moved to detroit to take up a show business career one of his first jobs was on a radio show called the happy hour club which is where he met his wife rose marie mantell he met her on the show and he escorted her home for 3 years traveling together on a streetcar finally he proposed they were married in 1936 and they had three children whom the world pretty much knowsmarlo tony and terre when rose marie was about to give birth to their first child marlo danny thomas was torn between his dedication to work and his responsibilities to his wife and his newborn daughter desperately he sought relief in prayer he knelt before the statue of st jude the patron saint of hopeless causes and begged for a sign should he or should he not remain in show business he promised that if st jude showed him the way he would erect a shrine in his honor danny went on to become one of the best loved entertainers of his era starring in many tv shows and movies from 53 to 64 he received five emmy nominations for a starring role in make room for daddy winning best actor starring in a regular series in 53 and 54 the show also received an emmy for best new situation comedy in 53 and best situation comedy in 54 he also produced comedy programs the dick van dyke show the andy griffith show the real mccoys and the mod squad yet he never forgot his promise to build a shrine to st jude he had conversations with his close friend and mentor a native of tennessee and archbishop of chicago cardinal samuel stritch cardinal stritch was the cardinal in toledo when danny thomas was in church and they became close cardinal stritch who served time in memphis at st patricks church after he was in nashville which was his home told danny that the shrine to st jude should be a hospital where children should be cared for regardless of race religion or ability to pay he told him that the hospital should be in memphis tennessee cardinal stritch was a great man for many many reasons but this was one of themthe creation of the st jude childrens research hospital with danny thomas the hospital located in memphis is one of the worlds premier centers for research and treatment of pediatric cancer and for other catastrophic childrens diseases it is the first and only pediatric cancer center to be designated as a comprehensive cancer center by the national cancer institute children throughout the united states and from around the world come to memphis and in through the doors of st jude for treatment thousands more have benefited from its research which is shared freely with the world global community no child is denied treatment because of an inability to pay the hospital has developed procedures that have pushed the survival rate for childhood cancers from less than 20 percent when the hospital opened to 80 percent today by unitedstates news and world report it ranks as the number one childrens cancer hospital in the united states it was the first completely integrated hospital in the south a condition demanded by both danny thomas and cardinal stritch black doctors treated white patients and white and black patients were together in the same rooms as one of memphis largest employers st jude has more than 3 600 employees supported by a fulltime fundraising staff of almost 900 at alsac which is the american lebanese syrian associated charities the shadiac family has a great history in running that charity alsac st jude the fundraising organization of st jude is the third largest health care charity in america and it raises money solely to support st jude danny thomas was presented with a congressional gold medal in 1983 by president reagan in recognition for his work with st jude childrens research hospital he died in 1991 at the age of 79 his great accomplishments and altruism make him an american hero worthy of the honor a commemorative stamp imparts his life perfectly illustrates how the american dream can be within the reach of anyone even an immigrant son of lebanese parents with a humble upbringing mr thomas was an extremely compassionate man who certainly deserves nationwide recognition for his dedication to st jude and all the children

yields to the senate for a provision thats included in the senate bill to eliminate quoteunquote essential air service for airports within 90 miles of another airport weve talked about the individual flight subsidy let me just look at this issue from another point of view to make it perfectly clear what we are talking about eight of the 10 airports that would be affected are because they are within 90 miles of a hub airport so that makes it much more convenient to just drive over and whats the subsidy to each airport each year let me just mention it athens georgia over 1 million of federal money so that people dont have to drive 72 miles we have morgantown west virginia right near the pittsburgh hub nearly 1 5 million the same thing with hagerstown over 1 million so you dont have to drive 70some miles to dulles jonesboro arkansas gets an 800 000 subsidy when it is right next to the memphis international airport the same thing 1 6 million going to johnstown pennsylvania

pennsylvania nearly 1 4 million also by pittsburgh and jackson tennessee 1 2 million in federal taxpayer money which is only 86 miles from the memphis international airport its hardly essential use of federal taxpayer money to provide nonessential subsidized airport service for people who could otherwise drive in an hour hour and a half to a hub airport that most of the people in the area probably

because i dont think were talking about the real issue here you know the cotton program isnt perfect a lot of the programs that we have in the agriculture committee arent perfect freedom to farm it was passed in 96 it got us into some of these problems i opposed it saved a little bit of money and then we ended up spending 10 times as much money bailing people out when it collapsed so you have got to be careful what you are doing but the problem here is were arguing about something that no longer exists this program that they sued us under no longer exists we have fixed it two or three times we tried to address this it was never good enough for the brazilians but we made some changes and we made some more changes and then we made some more changes in the 2008 farm bill its still not good enough for them cotton went through some very difficult times i dont have any cotton in my district this is not a parochial issue for me but if they wouldnt have had that safety net we would have been out of the cotton business but what was going on at the same time we had brazil using government money to increase cotton production in brazil and this is something that isnt considered in the wto because we are such geniuses that we agreed to this agreement that tied our hands and gave our competitors the ability to eat our lunch and thats whats going on you know jbs which just took over a big part of the livestock industry in this country is financed by the brazilian government they own 30 percent of jbs nobody complains about that the brazilian government created most of this competition that collapsed the cotton prices worldwide and then we agreed to let china into the wto and they promised that they werent going to go into cotton production we shipped our textile market to china and collapsed all of our textile industry and what happened they increased production like crazy india increased production like crazy our cotton prices went down below the cost of production because of these trade agreements that we got involved in but the way theyre structured theres nothing we can do about it but theyre going to sue us over a little step two program that we now got rid of trying to keep our people in business now if you want to ship the whole cotton industry to brazil and china and india you are on a good start to doing that and if you keep on this road youre going to ship the rest of agriculture to these socalled developing nations that are not developing nations if youve been to brazil in agriculture they are anything but a developing nation but theyre protected under the rules that we agreed to in this wto deal so is this a perfect solution no but we couldnt get the brazilians to honestly sit down and work this out because they dont want to theyre trying to use this for other reasons for other advantages in these trade negotiations and so forth and i dont think we can ever do anything to satisfy them so theres more to this than people are talking about here this is not about saving money this is about making sure that we can have a safety net in this country so we can maintain production of agriculture in the united states and not ship it all to other countries and not get dependent on foreign countries for our food like weve become dependent on foreign countries for our energy that would be the worst thing that could happen to us
