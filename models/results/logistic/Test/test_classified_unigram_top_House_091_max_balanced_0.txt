50 to 100 percent in testimony before the select subcommittee on education the administration indicated its belief that the time is right to provide the states with more flexible authority which would reduce their administrative burdens and permit them to build on their experience under the act by assuming greater discretion in allocating funds among these areas according to their own priorities in reducing five existing library programs to three the bill before us represents major steps in the direction of the administrations goal more than 85 million people have benefited from the programs of

centers for an urban neighborhood a suburban community a rural town or an entire region all this requires much money and public library income this year is expected to be 450 million short of the recommended 5 per capita the backlogged needs for library services and equipment are in themselves costly in 1968 the office of education estimated that it would require a lumpsum expenditure of 1 6

effect on unitedstates agricultural exports and ultimately upset our precarious balance of payments forty percent of the more than 1 3 billion bushels of soybeans or the equivalent thereof in oil meal or their products grown annually in the united states is sold abroad and 50 percent of the export sales are to european common market countries soybeans and soybean products account for more than onethird of all unitedstates agricultural exports to the common market the value of these is approximately 500 million while the action proposed by some of the common market ministers may be technically within the law it obviously violates the spirit embodied in the kennedy and dillon rounds of trade negotiations in a sharply worded unanimously endorsed resolution deploring the tax the house committee on agriculture on which i serve predicted that if enacted the tax would result in a reduction by about onethird of unitedstates sales of soybeans and their products in the common market countries this represents the equivalent of 60 million bushels or the product of 2 million acres in terms of missouri this means that if the tax had been in effect in 1968 only 13 million bushels of soybeans produced in missouri would have been sold rather than the 20 plus million normally purchased by the common market countries in effect the market for thousands of acres of missouri soybeans would be lost we are not without recourse however prominently mentioned as possible means of retaliation are higher import duties on european automobiles office equipment typewriters and wines unitedstates negotiators have voiced strong objections to the proposed tax and have relayed the warning that such a move would result in the erection of barriers to the entry of common market products in this country their warning was given currency by the introduction of house concurrent resolution 91 by the chairman of the committee on ways and means the resolution describes the proposal as a major blow to american agricultural producers processors and exporters tending to provoke retaliation by the united states commenting on the matter former secretary of agriculture orville freeman

more mhenacing every day yet we are barely beginning to realize how costly it is to us in terms of health material losses and inconvenience not to speak of higher taxes higher prices and sacrifices in comfort and wellbeing that face u8 as wetry to control and abate it last week the senate took a decisive step forward in the national fight against air pollution it passed the national airquality standards act of 1970 a compiehensive measure vhlch pinpoints the hitherto ineffective areas of air pollutioncontrol and attempts to rectify theii shortcomings in the light of new evidence of rapidly increasing health hazards and damage to property crops and livestock i applaud the stand taken by the senate that a massive steppedup attack on air pollution must be authorized i am particularly gratified to note that the key provision of the bill calls for greatly accelerated automotive pollution control efforts the report accompanying the bill states if the nation is to continue to depend on individual use of motor vehicles such vehicles must meet high standdrds the bill recognizes that a generationor ten years proseptember 30 197 0 ductionof motor vehicles will be required to meet the proposed standards during that time as much as seventyfive percent of the traffic may have to be restricted in certain large metropolitan areas if health standards are to be achieved within the time required by this bili accordingly the bill calls for the automobile industry to telescope its automobile pollution control effort to achieve 1980 clean car targets by 1975 this would mean a 90percent reduction in pollutants from the 1970 models the goals for 1980 set by the department of health education and welfare being 0 3 grams hydrocarbons per mils 4 7 carbon monoxide 0 4 nitrogen oxide and 0 03 particulates these provisions could mean pollution controls for used cars also since states are given the power to control pollution from all sources that do not meet pro posed new federal standards i ait aware that the automobile manufacturers have emphatically insisted that it is impossible to meet this advanced deadline because of a lack of satisfactory technology to control the pollutants involved i am also aware that the house version of the amendments to the clean air act does not contain any legislative deadlines for tighter controls of automobile emissions and that several amendments that would have provided more stringent control were defeated but i am convinced that drastic steps are necessary to eliminate the no 1 polluterthe automobilebefore it causes truly irreparable damage to our urban areas and before we reach the stage where public health in our cities is so threatened that automobile traffic would have to be eliminated entirely in the absence of adequate mass transportation systems in most metropolitan areas the results of such a step could be catastrophic to provide some leeway in the implementation of the new emission controls the auto industry is provided a modification that would allow a delay in making the 90percent reduction of up to 1 year if the industry could persuade hew that the 1975 deadline could not be met as specified i also endorse other provisions of the bill such as those dealing with stationary source pollution problems the bill authorizes regulations requiring that new major industrial plants such as steel mills powerplants and others achieve a degree of emission control that takes advantage of the latest available technology processes and operating methods federal authorities would be empowered to ban all industrial emissions especially hazardous to health such as asbestos beryllium cadmium and mercury as the senate report states the committee of public works determined that first the health of the people is more important than the question of whether the early achievement of ambient air quality standards protective of health is technically feasible and second the growth of pollution load in many areas even with application of available technology would still be deleterious to public health accordingly the bill proposes the establishment of national air quality standards for pollutdnts on which criteria are available within 30 days after enactment of the law ninety days would be permitted for comments another 90 days for review states would be required to hold public hearings and be allowed 9 months to develop implementation plans after federal approval states would then be allowed 3 years to attain national standards this is an accelerated procedure which is very welcome we have found in the past that without statutory deadlines very little is accomplished equally welcome is the emphasis on states responsibility to implement federal standards by formulating such action in ways best suited to their particular circumstances state implementation plans must spell out detailed steps to be taken which would include the whole spectrum of air pollution control traffic control emission controls mass transit plans land use plans monitoring and enforcement procedures and other actions necessary to meet the required deadlines i hope that mny colleagues will carefully examine

legislation and those in charge of the time will endeavor to see to it that those who wish to speak in opposition have that right madame chairman the committee on interior and insular affairs has carefully considered the legislation now before the house in addition to the consideration given to house joint resolution 247 this year the committee studied a comparable measure during the 90th congress but time did not permit its consideration before adjournment house joint resolution 247 is not a difficult measure to understand its purpose is simply to provide basic statutory standards with respect to camping activities within the various units of the national park system it does not prohibit camping overnight occupancy or the erection of temporary structures but it limits them exclusively to areas regularly designated for that purpose presently there are no statutory standards for the guidance of the secretary with regard to overnight use of national parks and recreation areas in fact he has general authority to manage and control all areas of the system and to regulate their use as he deems appropriate the majority of the members of the committee feel that this discretionary authority is far too broad particularly with respect to his authority to issue special permits to camp in areas that are otherwise unavailable for that purpose madam chairman there are many good reasons why temporary campgrounds should be prohibited except in very extraordinary circumstances first they can be menacing to public health because they lack the usual water and sanitary facilities commonly found at all regularly designated camping areas second they place an undue burden upon those who are charged with the responsibility of providing protection and other administrative services for visitors third they can cause irreparable harm to the natural values of an area or at best they can require costly restoration and fourth and perhaps most important they interfere with the normal public use of an area and with the enjoyment of that area by the public at large in fact madam chairman the national park service is so convinced of the validity of these arguments that it has denied some persons and groups permission to temporarily camp in areas not regularly available for overnight use on some occasions however temporary campgrounds have been permitted notwithstanding the magnitude of these problems the members of the committee do not argue that special temporary permits should be granted to all who applied on the contrary most members feel that these special privileges should be extended to no one or no group because we feel that such permits have been and will continue to be detrimental to the national park program and contrary to the public interest house joint resolution 247 if enacted would assure an equal opportunity for all persons and special privileges for none except in the extraordinary circumstances detailed in the resolution it would prohibit the secretary of the interior from permitting anyone to be domiciled overnight in any area of any unit of the national park system which is not regularly designated for that purpose the exceptions to this general policy are carefully limited by the legislation in the event that parklands should be essential for some temporary military or governmental use appropriate arrangements would have to be made with the secretary of the interior similarly in the event of some natural catastrophean earthquake a hurricane a flood or the likethe secretary could permit the establishment of temporary campgrounds before authorizing the use of any parklands for such temporary uses the secretary should explore all reasonable alternatives and should secure assurances that such uses will be truly temporary and not for an unduly extended period of time another exception to this general policy relates to the back country camping by definition back country camping is located in remote areas where regularly designated campgrounds would be inappropriate and impractical this legislation does not affect back country camping but as it has been in the past it will remain subject to reasonable regulation with these exceptions this legislation as recommended by our committee limits camping overnight occupancy and the erection of temporary structures to areas first which are regularly designated as campgrounds and second which are open to all persons on the same basis because the congress has the constitutional responsibility to make all rules and regulations respecting the territory and property of the united states house joint resolution 247 attempts to carefully circumscribe the discretionary authority of the secretary of the interior since it restricts his authority we cannot expect his enthusiastic endorsement of the measure but i hasten to add that this administration has indicatedas did the past administrationthat it does not object to the enactment of this legislation most of the members of the committee on interior and insular affairs feel that this legislation represents a reasonable measure of control over the property of the people of the united states madam chairman house joint resolution 247 is one measure which did not originate with some ambitious bureaucrat its origin is here in this house it is the product of a bipartisan group of members of the house who are intimately familiar with national park matters and who are concerned about the future of these treasured areas it was cosponsored by 14 members of the committee on interior and insular affairs and by two of our former committee colleagues mr morton and mr white to be sure we feel that more adequate camping facilities should be provided in our national parks and recreation areas regularly designated camping areas should be suitably located so as to assure the accommodation health and safety of park visitors without impairing the values for which the area was set aside as a part of the park system and without interferring with others wishing to use and enjoy these same outdoor areas in conclusion madam chairman we feel first that house joint resolution 247 is a reasonable exercise of legislative control over the property of the united states second that it is consistent with the constitutional responsibility imposed on the congress by article iv section 3 third that it is needed to assure the protection of park values from unnecessary intensive intrusions and fourth that it is essential to assure all people that they will have

their program of arming the arab countries the rogers policy statement is too new to be fully clear but as one who joined a sense of congress resolution in january of 1969 opposing the onesided condemnation of israel by the united nations as one who joined with a clear majority of the congress on the occasion of israels 21st birthday in which the congress reaffirmed its conviction that peace could come only through direct arabisrael negotiations i must view the recent statement by our secretary of state with a great deal of concern i must confess that i do not know why our secretary of state chose in the first place to make a public statement such as his december 9 speech it was obvious that the conditions set forth would be shot down not only by the arabs and israelis but by the soviet union as well unfortunately the political realities of such a pronouncement and the reactions to it are to harden the positions of the respective parties and make it almost impossible for them to move in the direction of the concept proposed aside from this i think it would be well for us to recall the language of the declaration signed by a clear majority of both the house and the senate which stated the united states should oppose all pressures upon israel to withdraw prematurely and unconditionally from any of the territories which israel now administers clearly this declaration by the congress is at odds with the recently stated policy of our state department the realities of the middle east today involve matters that are not easy for unitedstates policy to resolve they include arab intransigence and adherence to a myth that israel does not exist they include the open support and sanctuary by arab states of terrorist bands whose strength and influence has grown alarmingly they include the fact that the soviet union stands to gain from the subjugation of the state of israel the centuryold dream of the czarist regimes of a sphere of influence in north africa the middle east and the gateway to the indian ocean more important is the fact that the vital interests of the united states are at stake in this region it is in the interests of our national security that an independent viable secure israel exist in the middle east in the light of these realities it seems to me only prudent and consistent that the united states while working toward direct negotiations between israel and the arabs of their disputes should assist militarily and with economic assistance our friends in the middle east we have this opportunity now to respond affirmatively to the requests by israel prime minister golda meir these are a further commitment to sell phantom jets and other aircraft to counter the continuing soviet buildup of arab strength and secondly the request for financial assistance in the form of longterm loans to finance defense purchases"], [0.0003585219383239746, 0.500358521938324, 1, "i thinb it is important to point out that nobod3 can borrow under
