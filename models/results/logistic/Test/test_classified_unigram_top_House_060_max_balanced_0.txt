the actions of the majority one gentleman actually complimented the minority in very stinted terms however upon its performance of this duty i rise this afternoon to call the attention of the country to certain legislation now pending before the committees of this house and which ought to engage the attention of the majority in this chamber whether it does or not in the first place mr chairma i say that it will be nothing less than criminal if this congress shall adjourn without passing some financial legislation to make impossible if it can be done a recurrence of another panic i of course do not know what bill the majority intends to pass but hardly a day passes that sonie of us do not receive letters from bankers or business men expressing a most anxious solicitude with respect to this legislation this is not a party question and every man in this chamber should be actuated by the most patriotic motives in endeavoring to write upon our statute books the very best legislation the intelligence of this chamber can devise to relieve the present anxiety of the business men of this country for one i would scorn to make capital for my party even if i had it in my power to do so out of a situation like the present bankers and business men of my district tell me that it is by no means certain that the panic is over they have a right to expect congress to act the president has urged speedy action and we shall bring upon ourselves a coisdemnation which will be deserved if we allow differences of opinion to prevent the enactment of some legislation to restore the confidence of the people the effects of the recent panic have been felt by all classes not only by the banker the merchant and the manufacturer but by the farmer as well almost all legislation is a compromise while i stand here this afternoon many of our business enterprises are imperiled not because they are not solvent not because they are not honestly conducted but solely because there seems to be lack of confidence everywhere you of the majority are fond of boasting of your boldness and your ability to solve great questions the responsibility is upon you we of the minority have no disposition to obstruct the legislative pathway of any just and proper measure whatever bill you agree upon should be framed to bring relief to all classes as far as possible not only to the banker of wall street but to business men farimersall classes your legislation will be a failure if it only helps the rich atd powerful i have myself introduced a bill intended ias an emergency measure if there is any reason why the aldrich bill should beconie a law the same reason applies i submit with greater force to the bill i have introduced it can not be denied that the aldrich bill will inake money easier in time of pailic but it will at the same time strengthen the value of railroad bonds and stocks as well the bill i have introduced will likewis3 make money easier in time of panic and it would also tend to strengthen the price of one of the great agricultural products of the country which millions of our people are engaged in producing if a railroad bond is good security for emergency currency a bale of packed cotton is better security for many lmillion of raliroad bonds in the final analysis rest upon the bale of cotton and are dependent upon that great staple product fur their own value and stability upon the market the bankers of new york tell us they need a large volume of currency to move the cotton crop of the south and the wheat crop of the west if this congress will write into law the plan for an emergency currency suggested by my bill which provides that money may be issued against cottonwarehouse certificates then the farmers of the south at least will not need the assistance of the bankers of new york city more than this more than this the plan suggested by my bill would in tine of stress free the farmier from the doamination of the money trust of wall street it would free the smaller banker in the interior from the domination of tiii same trust i have not the time today to engage in a lensgthy discussion of the plan suggested by the bill i have introduced i will say that in my judgment it is a perfectly practicable measure a just measure and that the security for the eircuhnting medium provided is a better security than that afforded by the aldrich bill i am not one of the powers that be and i do not therefore expect that my bill will receive the consideration to which i believe it is justly entitled even the wall street journal in an editorial feels constrained to admit that the security afforded by my bill is equally as good as that provided by the measure which i am told you intend to pass if the great army of voters engaged in agriculture are wise in their day and generation they will give consideration to the idea suggested by this billan idea however by no means original this congress has now been in session nearly three months and what has been done nothing absolutely nothing and yet at this very moment there are a dozen measures of vital importance to the people of this nation which could be passed by this house in less than a weeks time my purpose in addressing the house this afternoon is to call attention to some of these measures for hundreds of miles along the atlantic seaboard our people are engaged in the business of raising truck for the market millions of dollars in recent years have been invested by our truck farmers in lands suitable for the raising of vegetables melons and berries and in properly preparing these lands for early crops quick transportation means everything to the truck farmer to some of his products a delay of twentyfour hours i am told means ruin in my state hundreds of thousands of dollars have been invested in the cultivation of berries the farmers of north carolina raise the best strawberry in the world they can not put their berries upon the market as soon as the florida farmer of course but for beauty for sweetness and for flavor i challenge the world to produce a berry superior to that raised by the truckers of my own state last season the loss which these people sustained was enormous why not because the crop failed not because of any fault of theirs but solely because they could not procure refrigerator cars to move their crops already raised already picked and crated and placed on the platforms of our railroad depots ready to be shipped to the northern markets thousands of crates of delicious berries were thus ruined i will not undertake to say where the blame should rest i do know it was not the fault of the truck farmer now to prevent a recurrence of this disaster several bills have been introduced and are now pending before the committee on interstate and foreign commerce i have not the time now to discuss the merits of the bills to which i have referred i shall do no more than call the attention of the majority in this chamber to the necessity of legislation upon this subject to remind you that the president in his recent message has recommended the enactment of some legislation to facilitate the transportation of perishable property and to warn you that if this congress shall adjourn without action upon this important subject the blame will rest upon the republican majority of the sixtieth congress again i find in the message of the president of the united states language as follows there is no moral difference between gambling at cards or in lotteries or on the race tracks or gambling in the stock market pretty strong language the president of the united states leader of the republican party declares in a special message to congress that there is no moral difference between gambling at cards or in lotteries or on the race tracks and gambling in the stock market i hold in my hand several bills introduced by your own people making it unlawful to use the mails in gambling transactions will you pass them or not your president in his message is demanding the enactment of some one of these bills into law it is now up to you you have the authority to act and the question is whether yod will do with respect to these measures as you have done with so many others and that is to leave them t6 die in the archives of your committee room i am told there is a class of men whose domicile is principally in new york city who have no other business than that of betting upon the stock market or the cotton market or the grain market no man ought to engage in any business unless that business adds something to the wealth of the world or conduces to the comfort or happiness of mankind the man who makes his living by betting that the price of a certain stock or commodity will be above or below a certain price at a certain time or who acts as the agent of others who wish to lay the same wager performs the very poorest pospible service to his fellowman if he puts a dollar in the pocket of one man that dollar is taken out of the pocket of another while in any event both parties to the wager must contribute to pay the betting agent for his distinguished services the fee that this agent gets is simply the rake off the keeper of a gambling house gets for providing accommodations for his patrons to play at cards or other gambling games there is a clear distinction between gambling pure and simple in the great staple products of the farm or in stocks and in legitimate purchases or sales for future delivery i know very well that our manufacturers of cotton goods for instance in the course of business are often compelled to sell the output of their mills for months ahead that in order to protect themselves against loss they must deal in cotton for future delivery transactions of this kind are of course legitimate and proper if the farmer wishes to sell his crop at a certain price to be delivered at a certain time no man should desire to deprive him of the right to do as he pleases with what he produces indeed he is well within his constitutional rights when he makes a sale of the products of his farm at such time at such price and upon such conditions as his judgment may dictate i am not speaking of either the one or the other class of transactions i am speaking of the speculator pure and simple who neither produces nor manufactures there is a difference between the two classes of transactions easily distinguishedthe transaction necessary in the legitimate course of business and the naked wager the president is urging you of the majority to act i hold in my hand a number of bills some of them introduced by republicans drawn to meet the recommendation in your own presidents message the question is will you pass any one of these bills introduced by your own people will you carry out the recommendation of your own president or are you afraid of wall street let there be no misunderstanding president roosevelt declares that the man who makes a business of gambling in stocks or in any commodity is no better than any other professional gambler no moral difference says the president what will you do about it you gentlemen on the other side of the center aisle youhave the power this machine known as the american house of representatives is in your hands not ours will you dodge the issue or will you meet it as your president requests you to do many of you represent agricultural districts the farmers of this country almost to a man are opposed to the professional gambler they live in a different atmosphere they strive and toil and are content to accept for the product of their toil the price fixed by gods law of supply and demand you will in a few months face these constituents of yours again what excuse will you render here are your bills here is the recommendation of your president here in this chamber now is your working majority what do you propose to do about it be assured that the people of this nation will be informed where the responsibility rests there is still another matter to which i would call the attention of our republican friends your president has repeatedly expressed his most strenuous disapproval of the great campaign contributions by which the american electorate has been corrupted time and again by which in 1896 you prevented the election of a man to the presidency of the united states who but for the use of a huge corruption fund would have received an overwhelming majority at the ballot box i have charged on this floor before and i charge now that in 1896 you used enough money to throttle the will of the people and thereby prevent the election of william j bryan to the presidency of the united states yes indeed the message of president roosevelt is one of the most terrible arraignments which ever emanated from the white house no less than a dozen times he feels impelled to denounce predatory wealth he speaks of certain wealthy men whose conduct should be abhorrent to every man of ordinarily decent conscience of corrupt men of vast wealth of wealthy nalefactors of very wealthy criminals of certain wrongdoers who happen to be wealthy no man will deny that such persons and such corporations as the president describes do actually exist in this nation but let me inquire who is responsible for their presence here in this boasted land of equality and of freedom how is it that in this country of ours criminals have become so great and so powerful so defiant so utterly regardless of law that the president of the united states in a message to the congress must prefer an indictment against them and in some instances even mention them by name prior to 1870 such a thing as a trust was hardly known in the united states we had few millionaires the wealth of onr people was far more evenly distributed than it is now however honest the president niay be in his purpose and i for one certainly do not question his sincerity the soleni truth is that the very party to which he belongs is itself responsible for the very conditions against which the president in his agony of spirit cries out today however patriotic the president may be the very party to which he belongs and its policies are resposible for the presence among us of these corporations desiring to rob the people of these wealthy and powerful wrongdoers of these lawbreaking corporations of these wealthy inalefactors and of tile modern american trust which according to the president has succeeded in crushing out every competitor in overawing our common carriers and in establishing a monopoly which treats the public with contempt the party to which the president belongs has made possible every one of the things against which he in his message so eloquently protests under equal laws impartially administered these conditions could never have existed under equal laws impartially administered it is almost impossible for the multimillionaire to exist the republican party has surrounded the trusts and monopolies and wealthy malefactors with a wall which shuts out all competition and has delivered to them the american people as their legitimate prey and because these trusts monopolies and wealthy malefactors have taken advantage of the opportunities offered by the republican party the president now cries out in righteous indignation and sounds the alarm of great national peril read over the list of your american trusts read over the list of your american millionaires and with rare exceptions you will find that they have built up their immense fortunes at the expense of the american consumer truly the president says there are ample material rewards for those who serve with fidelity the mammon of unrighteousness verily is this mammon of unrighteousness your republican protective tariff when you shut out competition from the whole world do you expect that your american trusts will fail to take advantage of the monopoly thus created by law the president very properly denounces monopoly it is the curse of our modern civilization no man will deny it but the greatest of all monopolies the most prolific parent of all your criminal trusts is your present unjust unrighteous protective tariff system by your system of taxation you have strangled competition and have created yourselves the most stupendous monopoly the world has ever seen and then your president rises up to denounce men for taking advantage of the very opportunities and temptations which you yourselves offer the president declares in his remarkable message that if it were true that to cut rottenness from the body politic meant a momentary check to an unhealthy seeming prosperity he would not for one moment hesitate to put the knife to the corruption you can pass your antitrust laws as often as you please you can make them as strong as legislative ingenuity will permit but you are treating this condition of corruption merely upon the surface so long as you allow the cause of the corruption to remain the very blood of our body politic has become infected by your unholy unrighteous system of taxation it is strange that this poison should manifest itself in so many places the treatment you haveheretofore administered the treatment which even your own president honest and patriotic though he may be is attempting to administer is but a weak palliative this great nation will never become absolutely healthy until you remove the poison from its very lifeblood sir john culpeper in a speech in the long parliament in speaking of monopolies declared thatthey are a nest of wasps a swarm of vermin which have overcrept the lands like the frogs of egypt they have gotten possession of our dwellings and we have scarce a room for them they sup in our cup they dip in our dish they sit by our fires we find them in the dye vat washbowl and powdering tub they share with the butler in his box they will not bate us a pin we may not buy our clothes without their brokerage these are the leeches that have sucked the commonwealth so bard that it is almost heretical these were the words of a prophet surely he looked down the dim vista of time and saw the vision of this fair land of ours blessed of god with all his bounties inhabited by a princely race of men but cursed and dominated by the most abominable tax laws that ever oppressed a free people it is high time indeed that the american people become alarmed at the growth of monopoly the trusts raise the price of what they sell whenever they choose to do so and in the same manner lower the price of what they buy the farmer the mechanic the consumer is utterly helpless they persecute and crush out those who would refuse to become a part of their unlawful combination no single individual or concern can stand out against them if he dares attempt it like a plague they sfirround him with the damning blight of lower prices in particular instances and in particular localities so long as it is necessary they will sell their own products at a loss in order to put the independent out of business their chief partner in this unholy warfare has been and is today the republican party and its high protective tariff not a man of you can deny the truth of the assertion that your protective tariff does shut out competition from abroad and does thereby make easier the problem of combination and monopoly in glowing terms your president invites under his banner all those who are ready to fight for the righteousness that exalteth a nation that righteousness consists first in the enactment of laws which afford to every man an equal opportunity din the struggle for subsistence the president repeatedly spcaks of the things that have been done and of the things that he is seeking to do today but he is ominously silent respecting our system of taxation which all just nen know is responsible largely for the abominable conditions which exist this mighty scourge will never pass away so long as the wageearner is forced to buy the necessaries of life from a corporation which not only fixes the price of these necessaries of subsistence but fixes the price of his wages as well this mighty scourge will not pass away so long as the farmer is compelled to buy from the trust and to sell what he produces to the trust which of its own volition fixes the price of both what he buys and what he sells this mighty scourge will pass away when and only when every man is accorded an equal opportunity by and before the law when gods law of supply and demand untrammeled in its operation is permitted to fix prices and when the many are no longer taxed to enrich the few i would not contend that a revision of your present tariff schedules will bring about the full consummation of this beneficent condition but i do contend that it is nothing less than criminal to allow your trusts and monopolies to prey upon the american people absolutely immune and protected from all competition our republican friends themselves have admitted as much by their action in this very chamber a few years ago we had in this country a terrible coal famine in some cities the price of coal rose to 24 per ton it is said that 70 per cent of the coal of this country is controlled by half a dozen railway systems there was a difference between the operaters and the miners or rather i should say between the coal trust and its employees the result was there was much suffering throughout the land in that dark hour what did your party in this chamber do you brought in a bill repealing the import duty of 67 cents per ton upon foreign coal you admitted that that was the best you could do under the circumstances and all you could do but you did it and when you repealed that import duty upon coal which was put there in the interest of the coal trust you found yourselves in the position your president has so often of late found himself to wit vindicating the principles of the democratic party which you are so fond of saying is incompetent and unfit to administer the affairs of this nation there are two practical ways to deal with monopoly first remove the protection it now enjoys against competition second put in the penitentiary men who persist in violating our antitrust laws for lmore than ten years the democratic party has been protesting against these very conditions which the president admits exists today the oppression of these trusts is nothiug new the corrupt men of vast wealth the many wealthy malefactors the very wealthy criminals the corporations robbing the people these have existed for years they are not a product of the year 1908 or 1907 they have been holding high carnival for years unchecked unbridled unwhipped of justice in 1s96 you had the audacity to charge these conditions to two years of democratic rule in your platform that year you summarized all the woes of this country and solemnly reminded the people that in a time of profound peace mr grover cleveland a democratic president had issued bonds it is remarkable how silent our republican friends have now become respecting bond issues in time of peace in the year 1900 your platform was exceedingly short it was composed of two words stand pat where oh where in all this land is the republicau to be found today who is willing to echo these two words so popular in the year 1900 stand pat is there a single republican in this house to day who is willing to rise in his seat here and now and tell the country that he is willing to stand pat no doubt that deep down in your hearts some of you still believe that was a good platform because upon it you rode to victory stand pat comes down to us as a dying echo never again to be repeated by any republican unless a reactionary shall be nominated at chicago but what do you say about all these conditions of which your president speaks in his message today how about your wealthy malefactors how about younr corrupt men of vast wealth how about the standard oil trust and its oppression of the people how about your corporations desiring to rob the people how about all these terrible conditions of which your president speaks in his message is there a single man in this chamber who will charge that the democratic party is responsible for the existence now of these corporations and these criminals what laws did we pass during the two years we were in power which made these things possible when the president frame i that indictment the prisoner in the criminals dock was his own party no other party could be responsible for lie and his party have enjoyed uninterrupted power from the 4th day of march 1897 down to the present time but one of the most amazing statements which has been made upon this floor was uttered by our very genial friend from the state of michigan in the concluding sentence of his speech delivered in this chamber some days ago the policies of theodore roosevelt declared he were conceived in patriotism and born of republican parentage this statement was followed by applause on the republican side of this chamber the railroad rate bill considered one of the most important measures which has become a law during the last six years our friend contends is a republican measure pure and simple in the first place i will say that surely our friend has forgotten the fate of a bill which in part bore his own name in the fiftyeighth congress that gentleman achieved early and enviable distinction in having his name attached as joint author of the railroadrate bill which during that congress almost unanimously passed this house why did that bill not become a law his party had an overwhelming majority in this chamber and in the chamber at the other end of this building the president stood with pen in hand ready to hffix his signature but the eschtownsend bill never became a law it died in the committee room of a republican senate but during all these years bear in mind the republican party has been anxious to enact into law railroadrate legislation which would guarantee to every shipper a square deal then again in the fiftyninth congress what happened remember that the republican party was still anxious to regulate railroads after much investigation what was known a the hepburn bill was reported it was not entirely satisfactory to this side of the chzz ber but it was the best legislation we could get i was one of those who did not believe that it would afford adequate relief to the small shipper and rising in my place upon this floor i undertook to warn the country that the bill would afford no relief whatever to the small shipper unless it conferred upon the interstate commerce commission the power to pass upon any rate or practice of its own initiative my eloquent friend from missouri who will i believe be speaker of the next ilouse of representatives did me the honor to listen to the remarks i made at that time it is of course now gratifying to me to read in the message of the president the suggestion that the interstate commerce commission should be empowered to pass upon any rate or practice upon its own initiative and that it should also be provided by law that whenever the commission has reason to believe that a proposed advance in a rate ought not to be made without investigation it should have authority to issue an order prohibiting the advance pending the examination i deem it only proper to say just here that i was represented in certain newspapers as being opposed to the hepburn bill i never was opposed to it but was heartily in favor of the best legislation i could get i did warn the country at that time that so far as the small shipper was concerned the hepburn rate bill would amount to but little i leave it to that class of shippers to decide whether i prophesied correctly i think my friend from georgia did the same thing of course it must be gratifying to him as it is to me to see our position vindicated now by the president of the united states in a message to the congress but i am diverted from my subject just for the moment during all of this time bear in mind the republican party was exceedingly anxious for railroadrate legislation well the bill passed the house almost unanimously it went to the senate and then what happened i assert here and now that all of the opposition to that measure in the senate with possibly one or two exceptions was confined to the ranks of the republican party i challenge any man to rise now and dispute the truth of this assertion day after day passed and the bill was not reported out of the committee weeks passed and still the bill was not reported out of the committee oh how anxious the republican party was for railroadrate legislation and when the bill was reported who had charge of it the chairmaii of the committee which had it under consideration the man whom the country would naturally expect to have charge of the fate of the bill on the floor of the senate not at all not at all when the bill was reported to the senate lo and behold the country witnessed the strange spectacle of this important measure put in the hands of a minority senator a distinguished democrat from the state of south carolina so anxious has been the republican party for the enactment of some legislation regulating the practices of our great railway systems that not one word has ever been recorded in a republican platform demanding it a democratic candidate for president has been demanding it for years a distinguished democrat from the state of texas was the author of the first bill which ever passed congress which attracted the attention of the country democrats fought all these years to get legislation guaranteeing a square deal to every shipper whether he ships by the ton or by the carload but according to our friend from michigan the republican party is entitled to the credit for the enactment of this legislation it was conceived in patriotism born of republican parentage nevertheless the hon benjamin r tillman of south carolina was the physician who presided at the birth of this infant when after many trials and tribulations and many days of peril it saw the light of the senate chamber in the fiftyninth congress just a word in conclusion inasmuch as my time has almost expired i have observed with regret recently a disposition on the part of certain gentlemen on the other side of the aisle to attempt to revive issues long ago settled and prejudices long ago buried we live in a new era any attempt to wave the bloody shirt in this chamber will not divert the attention of the people of this republic from great problems pressing on us for solution the leaders of both the great political parties are great and i believe good men they are not dissimilar in some respects i cheerfully concede to the president honesty and sincerity of purpose it ill becomes any gentleman here to attempt to ridicule one of the greatest and best neni this generation has produced william j bryan the leader of the democratic party there is one great difference in the position occupied by these tvo men with respect to the political parties which they are leading one is attempting certain reforms through party leaders who have little sympathy for the reforms he is adveating the other has behind him the rank and file of a great party whose representatives here almost to a man are in full sympathy with the reforms he is advocating in this campaign under the leadership of this man for the third time we shall appeal directly to the voters of this nation a prominent republican facetiously remarked the other day that bryan is the best asset the republican party has at present yes he is the best asset this nation has in one individual citizen whether he shall ever occupy the highest office in the gift of the people of this nation or not he has lived to see what few statesmen have ever lived to see in the history of the worldhis reforms advocated by his political opponent the present occupant of the presidential chair no life can be pure in its purpose and strong in its strife and all life not be purer and stronger thereby this man has been twice defeatedonce fairly once un fairly as i believeand the great office of president is filled by another of different political faith he is but a private citizen yet his strong personality and his influence for good are felt all over this land even by theodore roosevelt president of the united states"], [0.04152148962020874, 0.9584785103797913, 1, "gentlemen of the committee i am doing this because i know that if you will only take the pains to look through the data that i will place in the record that you will wonder that the human mind can become so accomplished in perpetrating fraud and acts of deceit i think it is doubtful if anybody has ever found so many ways to commit frauds and deceive in trade and commerce as the tobacco trust it is the most scientific thorough and perfect monopoly the world has ever seen i think it is really interesting to study its unique machinery or read of its stealthy noiseless and majestic performances and i dare say every lawyer and every citizen of intelligence in the civilized world who is familiar with the action of this combine expresses profoundest astonishment that such a michine was even devised by man i am unable to give all the facts we hope to do so later when they are officially published but i am able to submit today and place in the record some of the landmarks and you can easily imagine the rest

corruptionist these and similar concerns must be trimmed down or sooner or later our people to a man will be in a state of monopolistic paralysis last night i was reading in a new york tobacco journal a statement that the porto ricans are crying out against this monster and i think it has reached its hapds down into fair cuba and the statement is made that this has been the cause of a great deal of the troubles and the quarrels which have occurred among the cuban people in the course of the hearings on the free leaf tobacco bill one witness testified on two different occasions that neither he nor his firm were connected with the tobacco trust yet only a few weeks ago one of the officers of that concern called under oath the name of that party and of the firm that employs him stating that the firm has been a member of the tobacco trust since 1903before this witness testifiedand it is now said and i am glad to hear it that this witness was kept in ignorance of his firm being in the trust if this is true think of the firm now there is another case where a member of a tobacco organization has appeared about congress fighting what is known as the tawney aiticoupon bill he has stated so mr campbell president of this organization recently said that his firm was not a member of the tobacco trust yet it has developed in this suit that it is a member of that trust and so the

that state but the federal supreme court upheld the law passed by congress saying tiat an organization like that should not use the mail we did not stop it until congress had invoked this remedy then

stop it it has not been stopped yet and that speech was delivered on monday july 25 1892 now let me read a few paragraphs from it becausa i am sure you would rather hear from that great man than hear from me although this speech is many years old he says first i have shown these future contracts to be absolutely null and voidas being mere wagers as to the price of cotton on a future day and hence they are not legitimate dealings he further said this monopoly is in restraint of trade and commerceinterstate foreign and domesticand it as shown controls the whole business ie continuesit is shown if anything can be shown that these dealings in futures though actually carried on only in two places in two states in the union do because they relate to a product not present at the locality of the trade and need not be present anywhere affect materially affect the commerce in this product everywhere now mr president i have shown this to be an obstruction to commerce i have shown that it is a business carried on in only two places in the united states in which giving the same number to now york as to the new orleans cotton exchange only 600 of the people of the united states can engage i have shown that it is so interwoven and interlocked with interstate commerce in cotton and foreign commerce in cotton that the witnesses say if you disturb it you disorganize the whole system now what

myself but i want to do it honestly i want to do it along constitutional lines and i want to do it in harmony with that fundamental american principle of equal rights to all and special privileges to none sir for years i have been advocating legislation to restore our merchant marine and for years the republican majority in this house has turned to my appeals a deaf ear the republican party is responsible for the present deplorable condition of the merchant marine in 1896 the republican party wrote in its national platform a plank to restore the american merchant marine by discriminating

products he should be guilty and fined or imprisoned as provided therein now of what value is that going to be if you allow a monopoly or trust or some combination to buy up an official and get that official who compiles these figures to make a false compilation and that false compilation is issued to the farmers of the country for instance that the production of cotton is greater than ever before or that the production of tobacco is greater than ever before or that the production of wheat is greater than ever before now you provide that a man who gives out that information shall be fined and imprisoned but you nowhere have a provision that if a man falsely compiles such information he shall be imprisoned and fined this is no political question and i appeal to my friends across the aisle that you who represent the farmers do not desire to vote upon this floor that the trusts of the country may buy up sone employees and get a false report issued as was issued upon the tobacco crop two years ago the agricultural department issued a statement saying that the production of tobacco would be greater that year than any preceding year by 25 to 30 per cent the tobacco trust at once sent its agents throughout the country and they said to the farmers you want to sell your tobacco you are pooling your tobacco and holding it back for a bhtter price but you dont want to do it the farmer said why not they said look at the report of the agricultural department compiled by your ofiicials which states that the production of tobacco will be greater than ever before tobacco will go down in price what was the result the farmers of my section of the state sold their tobacco believing that report to be true and the trust profited by that false informhtion to the extent of many thousands of dollars and the farmers who love their country in peace and defend it in war are in this way robbed of the product of their toil now the man who gets the advance inforumation of the

wish to be discourteous to the gentleman but i have only so much time and i would be very glad to proceed it has the power to repress all measures it does not favor and virtually to pass nearly all the measures it does favor it is true that the rule of the committee must be approved by a majority of the members in theory this seems to be satisfactory but in practice is there a man that takes any thought but that as a matter of course the rule will be adopted why because this committee with the speaker as chairman has in its power in many ways to induce members to vote that way it controls the appointment of committees it controls their right of recognition it controls the fate of measures upon which the legislative fortunes of members largely depend naturally under such circumstances the committee is sustained as a matter of course except perhaps in extraordinary times when the people bring pressure to bear on members in accounting for the strange submission of members to present conditions it has been emphatically and frequently stated that it is not due to jiefficlency nor want of integrity nor lack of patriotism on the part of the personnel of the ilouse in part it has been charged to the changing membership in part it has been said to be due to the motives fear or hope for the speaker and the committee on rules have it in their power to reward or punish members in many ways as already suggested there is the sword of damocles hanging over the head of every member who dares rebel against the established order in my humble judgment having conferred with many members i do not believe that this submission is entirely accounted for in the ways stated the members of this house believe that we must have rules and that any rules are better than no rules we voted for the rules because it has been found impractical to change the rules satisfactorily in a few hours discussion at a caucus or for that matter during the first thirty days of the opening of congress with committee appointments hanging over the heads of members as was found i think some years ago to be the experience of the distinguished genteleman from iowa who made a contest along these lines if parliamentary reform is to come it must be brought about through a large portion of the membership of this house on the republican side acting with a large portion of the members on the other side members having the courage of their convictions on both sides mutually agreeing beforehand upon some programme for parliamentary reform this is not so great a task tile vast portion of our parliamentary law is entirely unobjectionable so far as it is parliamentary it has grown with the growth of our country and is peculiarly adapted to the requirements of our constitution and american institutions the only quarrel is with the political power that has been put into the parliamentary practice it is difficult to explain the effect of the rules on the membership without going into a technical discussion i have tried to picture to myself the effect in a number of ways it might be made clear i have thought if one would fancy that all the members had gone home disgusted with the rules save fifty who may be said to have legislative power i think fifty would be a maximum number it is a fact that each member may pass some private pension bills it is true that members are quite generally recognized to pass bridge and other minor bills under unanimous consent but on the vital measures it is safe to say that less than fifty members have any real legislative power indeed it may be truthfully said even these fifty may be reduced to threethe majority members of the committee on rules and these three may be further reduced to onethe speaker in the last analysis it may be shown that he alone independently possesses real power and the other members shine more or less by light reflected from the speakership i may use the figure of speech merely as such and say that the other members are satellites that move about the speakership in fixed orbits we know and they know that if they deviate from the prescribed orbits they are in danger of an eclipse and may be submerged in the darkness that envelopes the less favored members again conditions may be imagined if we compare the house to an umbrella the handle is the speakership whoever secures control of the handle controls the umbrella whoever secures control of the speakership controls the house the ribs of the umbrella are the spokesmen of the speaker the ribs have braces the spokesmen have friends the whole membership is the cover the umbrella moves up or down as the holder presses the spring so the person that holds the speakership controls the house the people see only the outside of the umbrella the machinery within has been arranged by the rules the minority party was intended to perform the function of the fastener on the outside of the umbrella but as the button so to speak has been destroyed by the rules the minority party is now a useless legislative flap again it may be imagined that the rules of the house confer upon the speaker the power of hypnotism and while the minority members may not be said to be rendered entirely speechless they are perfectly helpless the majority members obey the will of the speaker at times they break away but not for long they are soon brought back under the spell there is no question but that the speaker has the power of hypnotism over the majority under the rules but passing over to the consideration of tile presidents message i wish to call attention to what the press has had to say with reference to it i have here some of the leading daily newspapers that we all receive i will not take time to read extracts from the news columns or the editorials tho gist of it all is that there is an issue squarely between the congress and the president it is said that the programme of the leaders of the house is to do nothing and the president wants legislation speaking for myself i desire to say that i do not believe that there is any issue between the congress and the president i believed and now i am certain of it after the speeches i have listened to in the last few days that the great majority of the republican memlbers of the house are with the president if there is any issue and time will tell it is between the president and the rules of the house i agree with the newspapers that say that this donothing policy is not wise either from a personal or party point of view we can not as individual members go back to our constituents and point with pride to tie passage of some pension bills special or general or to many appropriation bills we must pass the remedial legislation advocated by the presi4ent i do not believe that it is well for an individual to fool his fellowmen i do not think that he can do it and succeed very long i do not believe that it is well for a political party to appear to be fooling the people we can not do that and hold the peoples confidence we must dispel any such appearance and pass remedial legislatioll why not then take up the consideration of the presidents policies why not consider remedial legislation in the interest of the people why not revise the tariff to the extent at least of removing the protection now afforded to some of the notorious trusts and combinations of the country why not pass a bill creating a tariff commnission to investigate atnd report a leasure to the next session of congress why not consider an income tax as recommended by the president to adjust the burdens of taxation among the people why not consider an inheritaice tax so as to return a part of the swollen fortunes of the predatory classes to the people from whom these fortunes were unrighteously taken why not consider amendments to the antitrust laws in order to strengthen the department of justice in the prosecution of some of these gigantic coibinations that oppress the people why not consider measures for the control of corporations which the president says is so needed at the present time why not empower the interstate commerce comllissioli to fix a valuation of the railways of the country in order to ascertain the only proper basis of rational rate making why not consider measures for the suppression of gambling in stock and dealing in futures practices that depress prices oil the products of the people at times disastrously which gambling spirit everybody recognizes was the cause of the present panic why not enact some if not all of the many policies of the president we would then have done sometihing as mesmbers of the house to which we call point with pride and then too there would be no question of our party success il the coming calmpaign just a word of a personal nature i am but one member the least of all the members in point of ability yet i have some rights and some corresponding duties as the representative of my district wleni was a candidate for a membership ill this house i pledged ill platform declaration and in public speech that i would sustain to the best of my ability the policies of the administration and i have been ready to redeem that pledge i took lny seat in the second session of the f ifty nimith congress and listened to the splendid message of the lresident but so far as i call recall now the only policy of the president that received consideration in that session was the matter of spelling and in the language of the street the house didnt do a thing to that i excused the leaders of the ilouse because it was the short session believing that during the long session the presidents policies would be permitted to come lip for consideration but sixty days went by we had done little more than pass pension bills and one or two appropriation bills the democrats charged us with wanting to kill time the republicans laughed and then came the special message the country knew what we were doing the president knew what we were doing he would not submit to it so he sent in the special message and i thank god lie did and i hope he will send many lore special messages to this congress we have been through this contest in wisconsin we know what it means i was not misled by the character of the free literature that i was getting from all over this country it was easy to see that there was a concerted action on to beat back this great reform miovemient championed by president roosevelt le understood it and he had the courage and the foresight at the right time lie seat its a message that stirred the nation and stirred this congress and we are going to get some legislation as the gentleman frol iowa pointedly said why can not these policies of the president be considered at this session why can not i as a member of this house be permitted to redeem my pledges to my people what is to hinder us i pause for reply why because welllet me read what speaker reed has said lhe knew the rules of this house he knew the possibilities of them and i want to commend what he said to the membership of this house this was written after he was defeated or rather after his party was defeated a democratic congress was coming in and he was warning the country of what they would be likely to do and what they could do under the rules speaker reed said there are many interests which are concerned to perpetuate the rule of the few the southern menmay we not translate a little here and say wall street over in new york and its ramifications over the country the southern men are fearful that this nation will some day awaken as it has once before awakened from the false idea that commerce is all and that peace and quietness ought to be purchased at any price to tie nobler idea that human liberty is beyond all price and that the government of all by all is the very foundation of our system tlere are some men wio desire when tbis happens that the few shall be so intrenched in forms and usages that they may keep tie many entirely out of control tie same may be said of all vested interests and vested wrongs these are all enlisted on the side of repression now i want to quote the paragraph which follows because here he is specific whereas in the other he was general but the great immediate power which hs for so many years prevented the manifestation of the power of the majoritythe power which hs kept the control in the hands of the few is tile combinaton or concert of old members who knowing the rules and being skilled in all the arts of killing bills without being caught and of depriving the community of what it wants while exhi iting zeal the other way tire enabled to govern the house and perpetuate their own rule but lest it be said that he is merely talking of a concert or combination of old members in the minority let me read what follows and i commend it to the new members so that they may know just what mr reed saw would happen to them when they adopted the rules ile says it will be an interesting spectacle in the new house to watch the process by which the new members will be persuaded to surrender their rights to go gently under the yoke and to witness their wonder and perplexity when they find that somehow or other they can not do what tiley want to do even after they have convinced the majority that it will be the right thing to do they will tien find that the gentlemen who have so sedulously hedged them in to protect them against the wicked republicans democrats have reserved for themselves a veto power greater than is intrusted by the wisdom of the constitution to the wisdom of the president they will also find that there is no greater fallacy than the idea that majority and minority are predicated of political parties only and in tha t connection i will read another sentence from another article of his in which lie shows how these rules have been franied along the years he says ever since the slavery question came to trouble the peace of the country tie rules of the house have been framed with the view of rendering legislation difficult the southmay we not again translate and make it applicable to the present time the south was anxious that there should be ample means at its disposal to stop any measure detrimental to its cherished institution the question conmes into the mind of any tihinking mai if the south if the democratic leaders were keen enough in their day to protet through rules their vested interests are they of wall street and they who represent them any less keen to maintain and extend the stne kind of rules lest a special message of the president should disturb vested interests and vested wrongs ff democrats canl do something republicans can always do it much better whether it be bad or good but let us look at this from a comluonsense point of view we will soon be in the throes of a congressional election there will ibe a contest in each of the respective plarties to determine the nominees and finally in each congressional district 40 000 voters will decide by majority vote who shall represent them in the hall of this house to record their will and express their wish at the next congress the same old motion will bemade to adopt the rules the country should know the membership of the house should know what the effect of the adoption of that motion will mean for at least one congress it will mean that the adoption of the rules places manacles upon the legislative hands of the member places a gag upon his tongue and clamps upon his brain for all the purposes of vital legislation in the interests of the people he is helpless to initiate laws he is helpless to deliberate upon laws and ie will have only a qualified right to vote which vote a caucus will at times attempt to control we are now to enter a presidential campaign there will be a prelimin ry contest to determine who shall be the standard bearer of the democratic party if it is not already settled there will be a prelimiary contest to determine who sh1all be the standard bearer of the republican party then these two nominees will engage in a tremendous contest for the election speeches will be made by the mile campaign literature will be distributed by the ton editorials will flood the country millions will be spent business will be demoralized and the people will be excited what is it all for to elect a president for what purpose to make appointments to organize the army the navy or other departments of the government these are organized now from the bottom to the top what is it all for it clearly appears from the platform declarations and from the speeches that it is to continue or change policies of government that means legislation the president of the united states will send his message to the congress as he is directed to do by the constitution he will tell the congress of the needs of the country but it will be in the power of a few in the power of one intrenched in the forms and usages to use the language of speaker reed to defy to ignore and to defeat these recommendations i wish to say to my republican fellow members who believe in the roosevelt policies let us look to the rules of the house president roosevelt has been trying to cultivate oranges for many years in the frigid climate of the committee on rules but what has he gotton but the proverbial lemons i wish to say to my republican fellow members who believe that secretary taft is the proper man to carry out the roosevelt policies look to the rules of the house i wish to say to my republican fellow members who believe that governor hughes is the logical successor to the president to carry on the progressive movement look to the rules of the house i wish to say to my republican fellow members who believe that senator la follette because of his constructive statesmanship as governor of wisconsin and because o his legislative achievements as united states senator is the rightful standard bearer of the millions of american citizens who believe in the reform movement look to the rules of the house the policies advocated by the president are indeed of vast importance to the american people but the most important the most pressing the most agonizing need of the country today is not one of these policies but parliamentary reform in the house it is fundamental it is a condition precedent to the passage in this house of all popular reforms we must give them the right of way we must remove the barriers the obstructions that have been placed in this house by the rules lest the great reform measures before the country be knocking knocking knocking at the doors of congress and there be little or no response for years to come the messages of the president are important because they emphasize the needs of the country in a vigorous energetic and patriotic manner for which theodore roosevelt is famous but i submit in conclusion that the greatest good the message will do for the country is to direct the nations attention to the immediate importance of parliamentary reform in the house in what has been said there has been no reference to personality or partisanship i respect the present speaker who was a member of this house when i was only a toddling child 3 years old i have the respect for him that should be had by a new member for a legislator of thirtyfour years of service in this house i represent however a different generation i recognize that he may not look upon the rules or the reform movement as i do and he may not be as ardent an admirer as i am of president roosevelt speaker cannon may not become president history is against it only one speaker of the house was ever chosen president of the united states speaker clay tried and failed speaker blaine tried and failed speaker reed tried and failed the people do not choose for this high office men who love arbitrary power yet the speaker has a great opportunity before him he can not reluctantly but voluntarily willingly gladly sustain president roosevelt in this great movement for the restoration of popular government in this country with the president hb will then hold a high place in the hearts of his countrymen but the speaker can do even more before he lays down the mantle of long legislative service he has it in his power to restore representative government in this house let him do that and the people will say for all time to come well done thou good and faithful servant arrendix a"], [0.9235913753509521, 0.07640862464904785, 1,

individual views to this house i purpose to say that i am doing it in the discharge of what i conceive to be an important duty the committee on the judiciary and at times this house has been charged with failure to pass certain what have been called important measures and the one that i have in mind is one of considerable importance to many and as i have read different newspaper statements in regard to the same and as i have heard individuals expressing themselves i have made up my mind that as a general proposition the most important question has never been considered by those who have been talking so readily and so hurriedly in regard to it the only thing that has prompted me with reference to the matter i propose to discuss has been an important constitutional question if there had been no constitutional question involved i think the house might possibly as far as my vote is concerned have b eii permitted to pass upon it but i have felt in my position that i owed a certain duty to the house and to the country and i have not been favorable to reporting certain measures because of the very grave importance of the constitutional questions involved i do not want it understood as far as i am concerned that there has been any desire upon the part of myself or the committee on which i have so long served to smother or prevent consideration of these important questions but as i have said i felt that the questions were not only constitutional but of very great importance to this country and it evidences how little the average man of this country knows with reference to those great questions in discussing it i simply propose to present to the general public the bills themselves and the nature of the bills and the important questions lying within them i want the people of this country to judge for themselves and at least give the committee on the judiciary of this congress credit for being at least honest with reference to these great matters i know a great many of our friends say as they pass along that it is useless to inject a constitutional question but a few days ago i sat and listened to a gentleman who has obtained fame in the supreme court of the united states discussing one of those questions and he made this remark he said i am absolutely sick and tired of hearing about a constitutional question they have forgotten that the american people are in power in this country and that it is a question for the american people and not for any individual not for any committee or any congress of the united states to say what is constitutional or not i saysaid he speaking for himself and i trust himself onlythat the american people are greater than the constitution of the united states i could not possibly agree with that gentleman i have been brought up to believe and my education in this house has been such that the constitution of the united states is the highest law in this country a supreme law that ought to control each and every gentleman when lie comes to act with reference to the federal government and with reference to the states i have no sympathy with any attack in favor of the states as against the federal government and i am bitterly and unalterably opposed to any attempt on the part of the federal government to interfere with the rights of the states but as this question comes to us today we are confronted with grave constitutional questions the labor interests of this country that are very dear to us all come here and say we have certain propositions which we have prepared which we submit for the consideration of the congress of the united states and we insist upon having those views written into the statute books of this country as a member of this house i have felt like giving consideration to the very deep anl important constitutional questions involved and i have no interest in this question beyond the great constitutional question involved i want the people of this country who are interested in the perpetuity of american institutions to know what questions have been presented to the committee on the judiciary i want them to know that every gentleman upon that committee has carefully conscientiously and earnestly considered each and every one of these propositions for himself i am not at liberty to reflect the views of any gentleman upon that committee i speak for myself only i want to leave behind me the reasons that have actuated my vote and my actions with reference to these very important questions i am one of those in this country that believe that these great and important questions have long since been neglected by the american people since the civil war we have heard nothing with reference to these important matters i do not want it understood that by reason of the settlement of the vexed questions involved in that war we no longer have a dual system of government that we no longer have a federal government and no longer have a government of the states we can not perpetuate this country except we preserve the rights and powers of the federal government and the rights and powers of the states and when we depart from these constitutional lines anarchy will result we have had these great and momentous questions pressed upon us i have earnestly and seriously considered them and i speak for nyself only i do not want it understood for a moment that i reflect the views of a single gentleman upon the floor of this house i have earnestly considered every bill brought into the house affecting this great question i have brought here every single bill that involves the great questions between labor and the capital of this country and i desire in the brief time allotted to me to rapidly present my views upon this important question the bills are as follows a bill in relation to restraining orders and injunctions be it enacted etc that no writ of injunction or temporary restrainlag order shall be granted in any

constituting such contempt with a statement of whatever defense or extenuation the accused offered thereto and the sentence of the court thereon that upon the return of an officer on process or an affidavit duly filed showing any person guilty of indirect contempt a writ of attachment or other lawful process may issue and such person be arrested and brought before the court and thereupon a written accusation setting forth succinctly and clearly the facts alleged to constitute such contempt shall be filed and the accused required to answer the same by an order which shall fix the time therefor and also the time and place for hearing the matter and the court may on proper showing extend the time so as to give the accused a reasonable opportunity to purge himself of such contempt but pending the trial and until the final trial and termination of the case the accused shall be admitted to ball in such sum as the court may direct after the answer of the accused or if he refuse or fail to answer the court may proceed at the time so fixed to hear and determine such accusation upon such testimony as shall be produced if the accused answer the trial shall proceed upon testimony produced as in criminal cases and the accused shall be entitled to be confronted with the witnesses against him but such trial shall be by the court or upon application of the accused a trial by jury shall be had as in any criminal case if the accused be found guilty judgment shall be entered accordingly prescribing the punishment that the testimony taken on the trial of any accusation of direct contempt may be preserved by bill of exceptions and any judgment of conviction therefor may be reviewed upon direct appeal to or by writ of error from the supreme court and affirmed reversed or modified as justice may require upon allowance of an appeal or writ of error execution of the judgment shall be stayed upon the giving of such bond as may be reonired by the court or a judge thereof

shall not affect any procedure for contempt pending at the time of the passage thereof a bill to regulate commerce among the several states or with foreign nations and to amend the act approved july 2 1890 entitled an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies a or i thsact nothing in said act approved july 2 1890 or in this act is intended or shall any provision thereof hereinafter be enforced so as to interfere with or to restrict any right of employees to strike for any cause or to combine or to contract with each other or with employers for the purpose of peaceably obtaining from employers satisfactory terms for their labor or satisfactory conditions of employment or so as to interfere with or to restrict any right of employers for any cause to discharge all or any of their employees or to combine or to contract with each other or with employees for the purpose of peaceably obtaining labor on satisfactory terms 0 0 the only question is as to their constitutionality those interested for and against the several bills have very ably presented their respective views upon the merits and i very much regret that the important constitutional question that i believe disposes of all the bills alike has not been discussed what is said with reference to the bills has no relation whatever to the district of columbia or the territories congress is asked to surrender its protective power over trade and commerce in order that crime if committed may go unpunished to deprive the court of the power to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life liberty and property to declare that what is now a crime against persons and property shall not be criminal in order to permit persons so disposed to interfere with the constitutional right of the citizen to enjoy life liberty and property to declare that what has always been considered vested valuable personal and property rights guaranteed by the constitution shall not be entitled to protection to deprive the citizen of the power to protect his property to tear away the very substructure of government erected to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life liberty and property the bills present several important questions of constitutional law is the judicial department of government coextensive in power with the legislative department of government can congress deprive the courts of judicial power conferred by the constitution does congress possess the power to prevent the judicial branch of government from administering the law of the states for the protection of personal rights and property rights between citizens of different states when not irf conflict with the constitution or the laws of the united states does congress possess the power of preventing the citizen from enforcing in the courts of the united states personal and property rights derived from state laws not in conflict with the constitution or laws of the united states whether the case be commenced in the courts of the united states or commenced in the courts of the state and removal into the courts of the united states is not every citizen entitled to the full protection of the judicial power of the united states both at law and in equity in all cases not in conflict with the constitution or laws of the united states except as to rights conferred by a rule of law does congress possess power to deny to any citizen the full protection of the full judicial power of the united states for his life liberty property and rights and subject his life liberty property and rights to the will of any person does congress possess the power to subject the life liberty property and rights of any citizen to the will of any other person does congress possess the power to take from the citizen rights and remedies given by state law when not in conflict with the constitution or laws of the united states is it not both possible and probable that if a court is prevented from issuing an injunction it may place it beyond tile power of a court to pronounce a judgment that can be made effective therefore does it not follow that to refuse a party an injunction it might amount to a denial of justice and deprivation of rights rendering a judgment ineffectual is not the granting of an injunction an exercise of judicial power vested in the courts and extended as provided in the constitution does congress possess the power to prevent a citizen from obtaining from the courts state or national protection to life liberty or property according to the due course of law as administered in the courts of law and equity does congress possess the power to provide that any person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances does congress possess the power to discriminate to such an extent that the legislation would be a denial of the equal protection of the law can congress deny one that is allowed an other under like circumstances does congress possess the power to say that no contract entered into between different parties no matter what it may provide for shall be deemed to be criminal does congress possess power to legalize crime does congress possess the power to surrender its protective power over trade and commerce does congress possess the power to surrender its protective power over trade and commerce in order that personal and property rights may be destroyed and the citizen deprived of the power of protection to life liberty and property does congress possess the power to regulate or in any manner interfere with contracts unless the same in enforcement would regulate or operate as a restraint upon interstate commerce does congress possess the power to deny to citizens of the united states equal protection of the law does congress possess the power to deny to citizens any remedy in law or in equity for any injuries or wrongs which they may sustain to person or property a great many of the ablest students of history and constitutional law agree that every government must in its essence be unsafe and unfit for a free people where a judicial department does not exist with powers coextensive with those of the legislative department montesquieu said there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive powers in every wellorganized government with reference to the security both of public rights and private rights it is indispensable that there should be a judicial department to ascertain and decide rights to punish crimes to administer justice and to protect the innocent from injury and usurpation as a general proposition i apprehend it will be conceded that congress can not change the law of any state not intending to include a case of a state exercising a concurrent power in aid of commerce when the subject of the power is local but according to the rule given us by hamiltonthis exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of state sovereignty would only exist in three cases where the constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the union where it granted in one instance an authority to the union and in another prohibited the states from exercising a like authority and where it granted an authority to the union to which a similar authority in the states would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant 32 federalist the bills seek to deprive citizens of the constitutional right to the enjoyment of life liberty and property and seek to prevent the courts from protecting the citizen in the enjoyment of life liberty and property it is a fundamental proposition of free government an elementary principle of law older than our government and older than any state in the union a constitutional right given to every citizen by his state that he is entitled to a certain remedy in the law for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive to his person or his property completely and without denial promptly and without delay conformable to the laws nd this valuable right is guaranteed and protected by the constitution of the united states and there is no power in congrvss to prevent the exercise of the remedy or take it away or abridge it or deny him the equal protection of the law and is not in i conformity with the constitutional requirements of equality of all men before the law it will be important and valuable to learn how far congress can go in depriving the courts of judicial power conferred by the constitution to a proper understanding of this question it will be necessary to ascertain the extent of the power of the courts of the united states and the power of congress over these courts this will have to be learned from the constitution believing as i do that congress can not erect a court of equity and then deprive it of its judicial power i shall at the outset invite attention to some cases requiring notice to be given on an application for an injunction the question first arose in the case of the state of new york v state of connecticut 4 dallas 1 the case was decided at the august term 1799 first statutes at large chapter 22 page 333 approved march 2 1793 section 5 provided that no writ of injunction shall be granted il any case without reasonable previous notice to the adverse party or his attorney of the time and place of moving for the same and the court held an injunction will neither be granted by the court nor a single judge without reasonable notice to the adverse party or his attorney the same ruling was made in mowrey v indianapolis and chicago railroad company 4 bliss 78 17 federal cases no 9891 p 930 where the court said the injunction ordered on the 28th of may was decreed without much consideration on my part i followed a practice which has long prevailed in the courts of the state of indiana but on further reflection i think my order for a temporary injunction was premature equity would seem to demand that in cases of emergency where irreparable injury would follow unless an immediate injunction were ordered the national courts should have power to grant temporary injunctions without notice of the application for them to the party enjoined but the act of congress of march 2 1793 forbids that any writ of injunction shall be granted in any case without reasonable previous notice to the adverse party or his attorney of the time and place of moving for the same 1 stat 335 in view of this act as well as of the fiftyfifth rule in equity of the supreme court it should seem that no special injunction can be granted by this court but on due notice and in the case of new york v connecticut 4 dall 4 u s 1 the supreme court has decided that an injunction can neither be granted by the united states courts nor any judge thereof without due notice to the adverse party or his attorney i therefore dissolve the injunction ordered on the 28th of may the same ruling was made by mr justice daniel when holding court in the state of arkansas in 1855 in the case of wynn v wilson hempst 698 30 federal cases no 18116 p 751 the constitutional question now presented was not raised therefore not considered in these cases the material provisions of the constitution are as follows all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and a house of representatives art i sec 1 the congress shall have power to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court art i sec 8 subdivision 9 the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish a a a art iii sec 1 the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority to all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to all cases of admiralty and maritiine jurisdiction to controversies to which the united states shall be a party to controversies between two or more states between a state and citizens of another state between citizens of different states between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens or subjects in all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls and those in which a state shall be a party the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction in all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make art ii sec 2 it will be important and necessary to understand what is meant by the words judicial power much has been written in defining the meaning of the same many writers agree that it is authority to hear and determine rights between persons and the state and persons mr justice miller very carefully considering this subject in his valuable work on the constitution page 314 in part said it will not do to answer that it is the power exercised by the courts because one of the very things to be determined is what power they may exercise it is indeed very difficult to find any exact definition made to hand but he comes to this conclusion it is the power of a court to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision the entire constitutional provision on this subject might just as well be considered together mr justice story said that the enumerated power found in article i section 8 subdivision 9 is but a repetition of what is contained in article iii the framers of the constitution not only provided a judiciary but declared that the national judiciary ought to possess powers coextensive with those of the legislative department journal of convention 69 98 121 137 186 188 189 212 federalist nos 77 78 2 elliots debates 380 394 404 this branch of the subject can be better understood by referring to the leading case of martin v hunter 1 wheat 304 in an opinion rendered by mr justice story in 1816 after discussing the constitutional provisions herein cited the learned jurist said such is the language of the article creating and defining the judicial power of the united states it is the voice of the whole american people solemnly declared in establishing one great department of that government which was in many respects national and in all supreme it is a part of the very same instrument which was to act not merely upon individuals but upon states and to deprive them altogether of the exercise of some powers of sovereignty and to restrain and regulate them in the exercise of others let this article be carefully weighed and considered the language of the article throughout is manifestly designed to be mandatory upon the legislature its obligatory force is so imperative that congress could not without violation of its duty have refused to carry it into operation the judicial power of the united states shall be vested not may be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish could congress have lawfully refused to create a supreme court or to vest in it the constitutional jurisdiction the judges both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices dur ing good behavior and shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office could congress create or limit any other tenure of the judicial office could they refuse to pay at stated times the stipulated salary or diminish it during the continuance in office but one answer can be given to these questions it must be in the negative the object of the constitution was to establish three great departments of governmentthe legislative the executive and the judicial departments the first was to pass laws the second to approve and execute them and the third to expound and enforce them without the latter it would be impossible to carry into effect some of the express provisions of the constitution vow otherwise could crimes against the united states be tried and punished how could causes between two states be heard and determined the judicial power must therefore be vested in some court by congress and to suppose that it was not an obligation binding on them but might at their pleasure be omitted or declined is to suppose that under the sanction of the constitution they might defeat the constitution itself a construction which would lead to such a result can not be sound the same expression shall be vested occurs in other parts of the constitution in defining the powers of the other coordinate branches of the government the first article declares that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states will it be contended that the legislative power is not absolutely vested that the words merely refer to some future act and mean only that the legislative power may hereafter be vested the second article declares that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america could congress vest it in any other person or is it to await their good pleasure whether it is to vest at all it is apparent that such a construction in either case would be utterly inadmissible why then is it entitled to a better support in reference to the judicial department if then it is a duty of congress to vest the judicial power of the united states it is a duty to vest the whole judicial power the language if imperative as to one part is imperative as to all if it were otherwise this anomaly would exist that congress might successively refuse to vest the jurisdiction in any one class of cases enumerated in the constitution and thereby defeat the jurisdiction as to all for the constitution has not singled out any class on which congress are bound to act in preference to others the next consideration is as to the courts in which the judicial power shall be vested it is manifest that a supreme court must be establishld but whether it be equally obligatory to establish inferior courts is a question of some difficulty if congress may lawfully omit to establish inferior courts it might follow that in some of the enumerated cases the judicial power"], [0.9119003415107727, 0.0880996584892273, 1, "an error was made in stating that the appropriation is larger than the

the rule to debate the question and to have it well understood i do not agree in general with the remarks made pro and con on this proposition to repeal the bankruptcy law there seems to be a misconception somewhere in relation to the law the original idea with the framers of the constitution of the united states was not to establish a system of collection particularly that was an incident only the fourth clause of the eighth section of the first article of the constitution of the united states merely grants as one of the powers of congress the right to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the united states not to establish a method of making collections that was not the idea at all but it was to prevent in the different states different forms of bankruptcy proceedings and it was denied in the debates on the adoption of the constitution of the united states that it was intended to affect the matter of insolvency laws in the different states and it took about seventyfive years for the supreme court and other federal courts to reach the definite conclusion that in some way or other the bankruptcy law of the united states operated not to set aside the state insolvency laws but simply to suspend them while there was an effort being made to enforce the bankruptcy law of the united states england has been struggling with this question through many centuries i differ with my friend as to the date in which she commenced she began in the thirteenth century and they legislated up and down trying to ameliorate the very severe collection laws that allowed the creditor to put his debtor in prison where the debt was less than a pound creditors not only seized the property of the debtors for its payment but their persons and put them in prison william shakespeare in his time is said in his history to have done this it was through the operation of barbarous english collection laws that we got bunyans pilgrims progress written in an english jail the effort was to get a bankruptcy system to afford relief from these severe provisions of the english laws some of which we had over here in the colonies and the earlier states in england a bankruptcy law was the result of a long struggle first to secure a measure of relief to unfortunate debtors it was not until 1542 that a bankruptcy system anything like satisfactory was enacted by the english parliament but it was not until august 1 1849 that it adopted a comprehensive statute on the subject the former act was in the time of henry viii the act of 1542 was directed in part against debtors especially a class known as illicit traders described in the act thus who craftily obtaining in their hands great substance of other mens goods do suddenly flee to parts unknown against all reason equity and good conscience it was criminal in nature as to such traders but it like all others looked to an equitable division of the debtors property among all his creditors it was not until in queen annes reign that the bankrupt law of england was amended taking away its criminal nature and the bankrupt became entitled to a discharge with the consent of a majority of his creditors even of this bankrupt law lord loughborough remarked thatthe law upon an act of bankruptcy being committed vest his property upon a just consideration not as a forfeiture not on a supposition of a crime committed not as a penalty and chief justice shaw of massachusetts in describipg the english system says it isan adversary proceeding against a defaulting trader upon doing certain acts indicative of present or impending insolvency these bankrupt laws provide generally that upon a traders doing certain acts considered acts of bankruptcy a creditor may apply for and obtain a commission out of chancery under which the whole of a traders property is sequestered and taken into the custody of the law 0 0 the proceeds of which a 0 are appropriated to the payment of all the bankrupts debts if sufficient therefor otherwise to pay them in equal proportions 0 the same law further provides that if the bankrupt will honestly and faithfully cooperate in the proceeding if lie will disclose all his property and effects and aid the officers appointed for that purpose by information and by all means in his power and do all the duties required of him in the premises lie shall be absolved and discharged of all debts and receive a certificate as the authoritative evidence of his right to such discharge but for this bankruptcy act providing for absolving a bankrupt from all debts upon the conditions named the framers of our constitution would not have authorized congress to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy in the united states when our constitution was adopted 1789 the idea was that we were not giving to congress the power to make a bankruptcy law and some of the courts afterwards held that the only bankruptcy law that would be constitutional under our constitution was the bankruptcy law of england in force at the time the constitution was adopted but that has been overridden by the courts finally and though it took a long time to get over all these things we have gotten rid of the oppressive portions of the old bankruptcy laws and we have done a great many things so that instead of the bankruptcy law of the united states being now an oppressive one upon the debtors it is one that gives them effective relief my friend from missouri cries out to have us vote to repeal the present law because he says it would be a mercy to the poor and the debtor it would be turning over the debtor to the fierce operation of the state insolvency and collection laws such as exist in many of the states of this union and offer him nothing in return in the way of a discharge in bankruptcy i believe my friend from indiana says there are cases where men get a discharge and start in business again well that is the very object and the benign effect of a bankruptcy law he says dis honest men get the benefit of it that may be so sometimes but i have no idea that 5 per cent of the men who get the benefit of the law are dishonest which leaves 95 per cent of honest men to start again in life and have a chance to start free from executions in the hands of sheriffs and constables and it ought to be borne in mind by members that a dishonest debtor can not if the law is properly administered get a discharge under the bankruptcy law of 1898 we have had our troubles the first bankruptcy law was passed april 4 1800 it had a limitation of five years upon its existence but on account of peculiarities that soon arose and the great complaint that came up from states in the union that were enforcing barbaric execution laws against debtors they repealed that law december 19 1803 in less than four years it was the people who wanted to enforce those barbarous colledtion laws which we inherited from mother england and who sent some of the better men of the country to prison because they were not prosperous and kept them for years or within prison bounds that secured this early repeal the great simon kenton the noted indian fighter of kentucky and later of ohio was in prison or kept within prison bounds for months if not years of his life under a law of the kind that they wanted to enforce instead of the bankruptcy law of 1800 robert morris the greatest of our revolutionary patriots who financed and out of his own resources and by his own credit maintained the army under washington in the field especially in the yorktown campaign later went to prison for debt and neither he nor his estate have ever been reimbursed we waited fortyone years to august 19 1841 to get another bankruptcy law and the same cry was again raised against that and it had an existence of only about two years it was repealed march 3 1843 we waited until 1867 and then we got a more perfect and benign bankruptcy law that did a great deal of good in this country it lasted eleven years and was repealed september 1 1878 congress passed another july 1 1898 with many improved provisions in it corresponding largely to the 1849 permanent bankruptcy law of the kingdom of great britain that is the law that we should address ourselves to to amend and cure its defects and perfect it for the benefit of the honest man who is unfortunate in his business transactions"],

common stock only unfortunately instead of being an organizer and an insider like my friend from massachusetts i was an outsider to whom a certain amount of this common stock was sold the 1 7 000 000 of common stock represented nothing in actual value but it was divided around among those who put in their properties perhaps my friend got some i do not know whether he did or not if he did not other organizers did of course i do not think the people in the coinpany ever supposed it would be possible to pay the interest on 10 000 000 of bonds dividends on 22 000 000 of preferred stock and also on 17 000 000 of common stock but it was perfectly possible to sell that to an eager public and for that purpose during two years dividends at the rate of 4 per cent on the common stock were paid and during that time i have no doubt that all the insiders my friend included disposed of their common stock with the greatest rapidity there is a thing which we can always notice and that is when it comes to some specially profitable provision of any tariff law to some specially possible combination of business interests no party lines are drawn our friends the democrats quite as much as the republicans are glad to avail themselves of that opportunity and to reap the profits and so in the international paper company one of the towers of strength in that corporation was mr roswell p flower who was as we all know a tower of strength in the democratic party a democratic governor a great financier down in wall street and a great banker there and i remember in connection with this modest investment that my friend and myself made in that common stock that it was selling at 40 to 50 and paying 4 per cent and it looked nice i saw an interview in the paper with mr flower at one time where he called attention to the organization of the international paper company wherein he told how cheaply they had gotten their plants at what low prices they had acquired their property from my friend from massachusetts and elsewhere and as a result what future profits would inure especially on the common stock after paying the dividends on preferred with the profits of this organization i remember that because on that statement my friend and myself made our modest investment a year or two after that when the stock was selling at 20 when dividends had ceasedand they have ceased from that time to this timemr flower was called away to his fathers i remember looking with interest at the inventory of his property and we discovered that among other assets amounting altogether to many millions there was just exactly if i remember correctly one share worth 100 of the common stock of the international paper company the stock we bought i presume was supplied to us by mr flower or other insiders out of a benevolent desire to let the public into a good thing i have seen that four of those who were largely instrumental in the formation of the international paper company died leaving fortunes in excess of 1 000 000 and at such results i am not surprised well now about the profits and this illustrates the possibility of profits in our great land because it was made not only from dividends on the large volume of preferred stock but the 17 000 000 of common stock which was sold at an average of 40 per cent was disposed of to the public while dividends were being paid so that would be called a byproduct of this corporation and that would yield a profit of 7 000 000 which is not to be despised so the company was launched it was badly launched because it had a great number of plants some of them of very small value bought at a high price and it was a badly managefj business formerly active competition from all the world stimulated activity the manufacture of paper improved and the price of paper lessened as a result of changes in the tariff the possibility of competition from any other country was shut off it was claimed that in having all of the plants or a large proportion of the plants gathered in one whole there would be great economy and great reform it has not been made it is no doubt true they are making more paper than ever but the fact is that they have not secured economy in making it"], [0.0006300806999206543, 0.49936991930007935, 0, "we will not have a vote yet there has been ample time given to those who are in favor of the resolutions

courts have invariably heldthe supreme court held last winter in the case of whitesmith publishing company v apollo companythat under the law as it now stands any reproducer by mechanical means of music may appropriate the copyrighted music of any composer without compensation the composers of this country have received not one dollar for the use of their music by reproducing devices of which millions and millions have been sold i doubt if there is a member of this house who has not received letters from his constituents begging him for some legislation on this question it is very difficult to solve that question gentlemen for this reason while we desired to give to the composer some compensation for such use of his music we felt that there was great danger that unless that proposition was safeguarded a great musical trust would be formed the preliminary steps in the formation of such a trust had already been taken we have solved it in this way and we have solved it we believe so as to be fairly satisfactory to both interests first we allow the composer to prohibit the reproduction of his music by mechanical means but if the composer reproduces his music by mechanical means or if he permits anybody else to reproduce it by mechanical means then everyone who desires may reproduce it upon payment to the composer of 2 cents on each mechanical reproducing
