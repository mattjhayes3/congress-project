what lay ahead for maryland schools and indeed the entire state she advanced through the county school system and constructed a legacy that can be felt in every classroom in maryland today thanks to her leadership and participation in countless school reform efforts in other states that legacy is also felt across the nation dr grasmicks reform efforts were well under way when she was named maryland superintendent for schools in 1991 at that time i was in the maryland general assembly her immediate goal was to establish accountability standards for teachers administrators and individual schools she challenged the status quo by proposing and successfully establishing teacher standards students standards and annual schoolbyschool evaluations she fought for unprecedented increases in state funding for education and school construction at times and i know this for a fact her plans met resistance and criticism but she backed up her reform efforts with real progress in student performance and is that not what really counts she exhibited courage by forcing state takeovers of underperforming schools and has used her pulpit to bring every county school system into her reform initiatives nancy grasmick has simultaneously served as the maryland special secretary for children youth and families also since 1991 at her urging the position was established to bring together the

yield myself such time as i may consume i rise to request that the important development assistance fund which is a fund that much of the appropriations for development assistance around the world is a very important instrument for development in africa the house has taken a step backwards by eliminating the earmark for the development fund for africa which was in legislation up until 1994 but we are not asking for the earmark to be replaced since it was removed but we are asking that 220 million be added into the development assistance fund which would fall under the development assistance fund for africa the dfa although we are not asking for the earmark now what i am saying is simply that during the 1990s 1993 and 1994 when the development from the dfa was designated we actually appropriated 850 million in 1994 804 million in 1993 so we had a continued increase in the development fund for africa the 1998 level was 700 million in 1999 it was approximately 700 million this year it has dropped to approximately 500 million so we are asking that 220 million be allocated within the development assistance to be earmarked for africa it seems as we have been talking about all of the problems in africa we have been talking about the aids pandemic we have been talking about the need for loan forgiveness it seems like it is a move in the wrong direction to reduce the development fund for africa the monies that are designated although not earmarked because these funds go to assist in famine prevention they go in to helping dialogue in countries to ward off ethnic strife they go into many very very important issues that help to make stable countries in africa i might mention that during the last decade about 85 to 90 percent of the nations in africa have gone under democratization we have had elections in practically every country many people have the misconception that there are dictators still in africa but that was in the past we have had elections in mozambique and in south africa we have had elections in namibia and kenya we have had elections in senegal we can go on and on and on so there is no longer these dictators who speak with the one voice i have talked earlier about the fact that we did have that problem in the past during the cold war where we created mobutu when we went and destabilized patrice lumumba and took him out of office with our united states intelligence operation and put in mobutu who of course supported the south african apartheid government of p w botha he supported ian smith in rhodesia who had the same sort of government he supported the southwest africa which did the same thing this was a mobutu that we put in because of the fact that it was during the cold war we can go on and on in africa but there have been elections in most countries we are looking for elections in the former zaire the democrat republic of congo in the future we have seen elections in most other countries so it seems to me that in order to alleviate poverty which is of course one of the great problems in africa in order to look at the anmount of funds that go into africa the population of africa is about 700 million people we are talking about 500 million less than a dollar a person in africa where we have seen other places around the world with much smaller populations getting billions of dollars so it seems to me that in order for us to look at africa 16 of the 18 of the poorest countries in the world are there while we are reducing the amount of funds available as i have indicated it is going against what we should been doing in this new millennium it is really not supporting new presidents who have been elected and are going through structural adjustments like in mozambique where they have had a growth in their gdp of about 10 percent annually as a matter of fact these countries different from what people believe that in the sadc countries which are 14 countries in south africa each of these countries has had an increase in their gdp from 4 to 12 percent even the country of botswana has had a balanced budget and has put more money in at the end of the day than it has spent so my appeal is that we increase the development fund for africa to put it to the levels that it was 5 6 and 7 years ago rather than to remove and have the money used for other parts of the world so i urge that this amendment be accepted i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0015734434127807617, 0.5015734434127808, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume this amendment is very simple it assures that the integrity of a law that the unitedstates congress passed the indian gaming regulatory act or igra is preserved and that states have the right to ensure that their concerns are fully adjudicated in the courts my amendment ensures that the states of florida and alabama have the right to have their cases fully adjudicated in the federal courts before the secretary of the interior allows tribes to set up casinos in states that do not allow casino gambling under igra in order for indian tribes to engage in casino gambling tribes must have an approved tribalstate compact however in april of 1999 the department of the interior set forth a process whereby indian tribes may bypass state governments and appeal to the secretary of interior to allow them to set up a casino this is the subject of a court case my amendment simply states let the case run its full course before the secretary approves a casino operation in a place like florida or alabama which do not allow casinos florida and alabama have filed suit against the department arguing that the department does not have the authority to issue these regulations in the first place these regulations trample on the rights of states and what could be worse deny the states their full day in court on three separate occasions the people of florida have voted against allowing casinos in their state now these regulations would establish a way for the tribes to bypass the will of the people of florida and open casinos this is not a bipartisan issue my amendment is supported by the republican governor of florida and the democrat attorney general i believe and the state of florida believes the department of the interior has exceeded its authority granted under igra by issuing a regulatory remedy on a matter that both congress and the supreme court have stated should be determined by the states my amendment would simply ensure that the state of florida has the right to have its case fully adjudicated prior to the department publishing procedures which would allow indian tribes to open casinos in florida what specifically does my amendment do my amendment says that the department may not publish procedures prescribed under the april 1999 regulations publications of these procedures would permit the tribes to open casinos my amendment allows the secretary to go right up to that line but may not cross it unless the courts have ruled in its favor why is this amendment needed some correspondence from the department indicates that the secretary will not issue these procedures until the case has been decided i am pleased to have in my possession a letter from the secretary dated june 14 in which the secretary says he will not publish those procedures until the courts have decided whether or not he has the right to do that i appreciate the secretarys letter which i believe is an endorsement of the language in my amendment they say the same thing i am nonetheless compelled to offer this amendment however because we will have a new administration in 6 months and we will have most likely a new secretary of the interior the next secretary is not bound by secretary babbitts letter the new secretary will be bound by the legislation passed by this congress that is why the adoption of this amendment is needed it will ensure that the policy i am advocating and that the secretary supports will be followed i am very appreciative of the secretarys support and i certainly support him in this position to reiterate my amendment maintains the status quo of igra it ensures that tribes can still use the current indian gaming regulatory act process to engage in class 3 gaming it preserves the right of congress to pass laws and major policy changes it continues incentives for tribes and states to pursue legislation to remedy differences over igra it prevents the secretary from bypassing or shortcircuiting states rights and it protects states rights without harming the tribes it does exactly what the secretary is calling to be done my amendment does not do the following this amendment does not amend the indian gaming regulatory act the weldon amendment does not affect existing tribalstate compacts the amendment does not limit the ability of tribes to obtain class 3 gaming as long as valid compacts are entered into by the tribes with the states pursuant to existing law i encourage my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
