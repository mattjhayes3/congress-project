good in theory but i submit there can be no intelligent competition unless the rates are based upon the principle of making good the difference in cost of production at home and abroad if the rates are so high as to be prohibitive there can be no compititlon it is equally true that if the rates are so low as to destroy home production there will be no competition fair competition can never be secured and maintained without legislation enacted with intelligent regard for the difference in the cost of production at home and abroad the gentleman front alabama is simply indulging in sophistry he recognizes the lameness of the tariffforrevenue theory if applied without regard to its effect upon industries he therefore approaches the republican doctrine of protection based upon the actual difference between the cost of production and he flirts with this theory calling it the competitive theory as though it could be competitive and not protective a nonpartisan tariff commission to ascertain and report to congress all the facts regarding production at home and abroad is the only way competition and protection can be secured and maintained but on what strange new theory has the committee hit when it puts a duty of 10 cents a bushel on wheat and admits flour free when it taxes cattle and admits meat free this alarming and extraordinary principle of taxing the raw material of the manufacturer and admitting free of duty the finished article of his foreign competitor is competition with a vengeance it is bum business sham statesmanship what chance has a miller of minnesota to pay a full price to the minnesota farmer for cash wheat at the terminal markets under this law what chance has the miller to compete with flour from england and south america if he pays the northwestern farmer the price apparently secured to him by the 10cent tariff on wheat the gentleman from alabama speaks of sane competition then he puts hobble skirts around the legs of the millers and blinders on the farmers while entering them in the foodsupplying contest of the world this is not fair all the smiles and suavity of the artful leader of the majority can never make it fair it is not fair to the millers and it is not fair to the farmers who never can get more for their wheat than the millers can afford to pay and compete with foreign flour we have in this country over 10 000 flour mills and they represent a capitalization of approximately 350 000 000 it is a stupendous lindustry it gives employment to many thousands of highclass men who can not afford to have their wages lowered to meet the competition of england nor to be thrown out of employment because the market for their output will be restricted it is thought that when the senate gets this bill that protection will be given the milling industry by placing wheat on the free list and thus enable the mills to obtain enormous quantities of wheat from canada at a low price this would put the millers on equal terms with foreign millers but it would be at the expense of the farmers of this country free wheat would hit minnesota and dakota especially hard because of the vast fields that lie to the north which raise wheat in greater abundance and at less cost does anyone think that hitting the farmer will help the men in town or make the lot of the laborer any easier is anyone so dull as to fail to see that the general welfare of the laboring mn as well as of the business man in the cities nst always and constantly depend upon the prosperity and productiveness of the farms there can be no conflict of interest between the farmers and the toilers in town their interests are identical if you make farm life hard and unattractive the young men and women of the country will congest the cities and make more fierce the competition of the city toilers furthermore it will make the farms less productive therefore farm supplies less plentiful therefore higher prices will be charged for food toeat you never can make the food of the earth cheap to city dwellers except by making farms pleasant and productive so that bounteous crops will be raised the cities of the northwest are especially dependent on the prosperity of the farms of the northwest a fiscal law like this designed to supply the great cities on the seashore with cheap nicat from south america and cheap bread from the mills and bakeries of england that can easily be delivered on the docks of new york on cheap ocean rates may make the cost of living less in that great city but it will drain much money from america as well as narrow the market of the northwest producer and knock off his prices what effect will this have upon our cities what keeps our cities going but our mills our commerce our transportation generally speaking the business of supplying the farmers with their needs and carrying the farmers crops to the markets of the world destroy the farmers crops and you cut commerce coming and going cut commerce in two and you destroy onehalf of the citys business and make the other half still and stagnant you injure labor also when traffic falls off the railroads aiid factories let out their surplus men when farms are unproductive surplus help and discontented farmers boys also congregate in the cities swelling the ranks of the unemployed men out of work stop buying from merchants merchants with diminishing sales dismiss their clerks clerks and factory hands and railroad men and discontented farmers glut the labor market lowering wages compelling strikes and disorder and breeding widespread discontent all caused by a selfish law our agriculture is stricken down and going down carries with it the countrys commnierce and the citys life the gentleman from alabama also says that his party is legislating in the interest of the consumer does he not know that in this country consumers and producers are identical in every wellordered community the consumer is also a prodine no man has a right to do nothing if he consumes the idle overrich and the tramp consume without producing but generally speaing you can not legislate adversely to the producer without injury to the consumer for they are identical the majority claim they are redeeming their promise to reduce the cost of living and in so far as they are helping consumers without at the same time inflicting injury upon the same consumers in their capacity as producers their efforts are commendable it is well to make necessities cheaper but what good are cheap things if you have nothing to buy them with it is good to lower the cost of living if at the same time and to a greater degree you do not lower the means of livelihood this bill is not wisely drawn for in too many paragraphs our saving as consumers will not equal our loss as producers leaving the balance of trade against us as a nation and making us constantly poorer as a people sending millions of our money annually to south america for meat and flour will never make us as a nation more able to buy food and clothing generally the cost of living should be reduced of course but do not begin at the wrong end and cripple the producer tariff rates are too high and should be lowered but not to the extent of draining our country of its cash mud putting our producers out of business hit the trusts as hard as you like for the trusts are largely responsible for the high cost of living the rakeoff by middle men inluding the freight rates and unnecessary machinery of distribution caused by the overcongestion of the cities the watered stock of corporations big and little and the waste and destruction of capital in needless pursuits is responsible quite as much as the direct tariff for the excessive prices paid by consumers in this country and the gentlemen on the other side are dreaming vainly if they think that this bill will solve the problem if this revision were fairly and wisely made it would aim to help and not hamper the farmers of our country the cities are too big now and contain to many nonproductive men like lawyers and doctors and bankers and brokers jobbers and journalists too many clerks in too many offices all occasioned by the artificial abnormal extravagant unhealthy and unwholesome life of the great congested cities it would be infinitely better for the race if the pure and invigorating life of the farms was made so attractive prosperous and easy that men and women would live there by choice congestion is disease either in national or physical life it induces pain and decay in the nation as it does in the body it always means ultimate destruction if not checked and controlled this bill encouraging cheap low living on foreign products in our seaboard cities is unscientific and utterly lacking in comprehensive statesmanship so far as its agriculture schedules are concerned it is tax from any angle and it is hostile to the farmer true it gives him free lumber but with free meat free flour and free potatoes putting him in competition with the plains of south america and other foreign fields he will have no occasion to enlarge his barns and granaries and have no money with which to build new houses but says the gentleman from new york we have lowered the rate on clap rugs and mats from china and japan mand we have put cash registers lifeboats and stones and sand on the free list the farmers of the northwest care little for japanese art at any price their cash requires no registers in counting they have all the stones and sand they need in their business the people of our cold country are entitled to have woolen blankets and woolen clothing at a more reasonmble price than they have been compelled to pay but it is not a square deal to put raw wool on the free list while still giving a protection to woolen manufacturers of 25 per cent on blankets 35 per cent on dress goods and 50 per cent on carpets the woolen trust with its lawyers and lobbyists and not the farmer with his flocks of sheep has always been responsible for the excessive cost of woolen goods this bill continues to protect the wool trust it will wipe out the sheep raisers of this country and our money will go away for mutton as well as wool and help the farmers in foreign lands the theory of this bill seems to rest on the principle of giving everything to the foreigner and getting nothing in return it would be better to encourage the production of mutton and wool in this country you discourage it in the face of the record since 1867 which shows that whenever the duties were below 11 cents per pound our flocks have decreased while on the other hand they have always increased during periods when the rate was 11 cents per pound or higher during the last four years of the time the 12 cents per pound rates of 1867 were in force flocks increased about 25 per cent during the six years of the time when the 1ss3 law of 10 cents per pound was in force they decreased 16 per cent during something less than four years of the licent rate of 1890 flocks showed an increase of 10 per cent under the law of 1894 for a like period while wool was free there was a decrease of 21 per cent in the flocks under the law of 1897 of 11 cents per pound there has been an increase of 46 per cent in the face of this record we may be able to eat cheap mutton while we idly sit and watch the passing of this nations diminishing herds of sheep but if our herds are destroyed and the packing trust controls the carcasses that come from argentina and australia will our mutton be either cheap or wholesome furthermore it is absurd to argue that free raw wool will substantially affect the price of woolen clothing under the present rate the amount of the tariff tax actually paid on all of the raw wool that is used in the making of an ordinary suit of clothes is about 75 cents it is the excessive rate on woolen clothing under the present law and not the rate on raw wool and the domination of the woolen trade by the trust that compels the consumer to pay from 5 to 15 per suit more than he should pay permit me time in conclusion to say that this underwood bill should not be recommended for passage in its present form it is wrong and inconsistent to tax woolen clothing while admitting raw wool free to tax wheat while admitting flour free to tax cattle while admitting beef free it is wrong to legislate our sheep raisers out of business to make the hazardous business of raising potatoes on a large scale more hazardous by the free admission of that important product it is wrong to put white men and women in minnesota working at fair wages making clean and wholesome mats and rugs out of wire grass in competition with the cheap low toilers of china and japan making similar rugs out of like material it is wrong to cut the rate of hay in two subjecting our farms to the vast prairies of canada and preventing our farmers from properly conserving their land by rotating their crops unless they do so at a loss it is wrong selfish and discriminating to tax the cheap furs needed in the north while admitting free the things required by the cotton growers of the south it is wrong and unwise to legislate against agriculture as this bill does it injures the farmer and laborer as well for in our civilization they must stand or fall together this measure is wise in many respects but it is fundamentally unfair to the north and especially the northwest it is a partial partisan law this bill will help the cotton belt and the congested seaboard cities it will help consumers with fixed incomes here and there temporarily but in the long result it can not serve this nation well because it will drain too much money to foreign lands lower the standards of our toiling millions in their futile effort to compete with lower types and set back and retard the growth of agriculture which is and must always be the heart of this nations national life the support of this nations strength and the source of all our real and enduring greatness"], [0.010066471062600613, 0.010066471062600613, 0, "the people of this country are just awakening to the fact that a minority party temporarily in power is about to take advantage of its transitory authority find place upon the statute books of our nation a tariff law the avowed purpose of which is to strike down the longestablished policy of protection to american industry under the specious argument of reducing the high cost of living it first attacks the products of the farm by proposing wholesale reductions of the present protective duty upon articles raised or produced by the american farmer leaving the agricultural interests of our land to withstand the tide of importation from canada south america and europe on these articles the custom duty under the proposed underwood bill is on an average but onehalf what it is under existing law dairy products receive woeful hurt foreign butter soon may be imported to compete with the american product by paying 3 cents per pound in place of 6 cents hay at 2 per ton in place of 4 apples will be called upon to compete with the great canadian and nova scotian crops with the protection of only 10 cents per bushel as against an existing duty of 25 cents milk and cream may under the underwood bill be brought across the canadian line at any point free of any duty to depress the price as against the protection afforded the farmer by the duty of 2 cents per gallon on milk and 5 cents per gallon on cream which the existing tariff law requires to be paid milk preserved or condensed will go upon the free list and thus bring the american dairyman into unequal competition with the foreign products what is true of dairy products is equally true of grains and vegetables produced on the american farm notably potatoes which under the present law are subject to an import duty of 25 cents per bushel will under the underwood bill be admitted free and so supplant the products of american soil when the underwood bill becomes a law those engaged in producing them must face a new rival and greater competition and this the democratic party frankly admits is for the purpose of reducing the high cost of living the farmers of the country are asked to accept this tariff bill and policy which lays the ax at the very root of the tree of their prosperity because forsooth the underwood bill proposes to place agricultural implements on the free list the democratic proposition is to remove the duty on the implement with which the farmer digs his potatoes and expect the farmer to so rejoice in the saving on the price of a hoe that he would welcome the flood of dutyfree potatoes imported to depreciate the price of his own product such logic could find no better illustration than in a proposition to cut ones throat to stop ones appetite i trust i have no narrow partisan spirit i know that the sincere desire of my heart is the advancement of the material moral and intellectual welfare of the splendid and patriotic people of the district which has honored me and of the grand old state of pennsylvania whose magnificent history records in glowing words a long list of great achievelnentsin behalf of civil liberty the difference between the two great parties is fundamental and is now more sharply defined than in any of the years past the republican party stands squarely for the principle of protection rightly applied it recognizes that all men with the mnost humble citizen stand equal before our law and that that equality can not be maintained except as by law we differentiate and protect him from the hordes of underpaid laborers of other lands whose conception of individual rights does not accord with our own the toiler in america is an american citizen this gives the highest honor which can rest upon anyone the toiler in other lands is not protected and cared for by such an equality of citizenship or privilege the living and the wage must necessarily be different and a protective tariff imposed by the federal government measures that difference and is calculated to keep and maintain every american citizen on the high plain and privilege of his american citizenship the democratic party adopting and from time to time altering a fleeting terminology has never successfully disguised its freetrade position and now that it is in power it proposes to remove the prop of a tax by which it means the protective policy and to open the doors of our ports to the free importation of foreignproduced articles except as in those instances where for revenue only a duty is maintained under the evanescent term competitive tariff a competitive tariff an unhappy though convenient term it covers a multitude of errors of commission and omission for a bill actually nondescript in its real nature and purpose built wholly upon theory uncertain in principle its schedules and rates based chiefly upon guesswork as are the estimates of revenue to be derived from it and return to the ad valorem system that opens the door to fraud it may as well be called a competitive tariff as anything else what does it mean if it has any significance is it not an invitation to foreign producers to come into our splendid home market with their wares and goods and compete with the products of our own farms and factories if not this what else can it mean this is democratic altruism this is democratic magnanimity seriously was ever a proposition so unbusinesslike or so fallacious in political economy natural competition is all right it has been called the life of trade but when this principle is extended artificially as it is proposed now to do in order as it is claimed for it to break down artificial props to business when it is extended beyond natural domestic zones it becomes a menace to home industry whether the zone be a village or the entire country now what does this competitive tariff theory mean from the standpoint of those advocating it that it is a theory is admitted by the author of the bill in his opening speech on this bill he said how do we arrive at a basis in writing a revenue tariff bill we adopt the competitive theory then the gentleman goes on to explain this competitive theory in this manner we say that no revenue can be produced at the customhouse unless there is some competition between the products of foreign countries and domestic products when we admit that some competition should exist in every line of industry then it is a simple proposition to compare the amount of imports coming into this country with the amount of goods consumed and you can ascertain at the customhouse whether there is any competition so here is the supposed basis upon which the rates in this bill were fixedbut the simple proposition as the gentleman calls it of comparing imports with domestic coisnmption no wonder the gentleman calls this a theory it is not only a theory but an iridescent dream as unsubstantial as the basis of every democratic attempt at tariff revision this bill is not based upon the simple proposition its author lays down on the contrary it is based on guesswork and is essentially devoid of a fixed guididg principle either as a tariffforrevenueonly bill or as a competitive tariff the gentleman practically admits this he says unfortunately we have not had the data in all instances to determine this but the president he says will be authorized to furnish the information annually and when exact knowledge of the amount of imports and the american consumption in any given article is secured we will be able to tell whether rates are conpeti tive in its platform in 1912 the democratic party charged that excessive prices result in large measure from the hightariff laws enacted and maintained by the republican party the republican party denied this and declared the steadily increased cost of living has become a matter not only of national but of worldwide concern antd further stated the fact that it is not due to the protectivetariff system is evidenced by the existence of similar conditions in countries which have a tariff policy different from our own as well as by the fact that the cost of living has increased while rates of duty have remained stationary or been reduced now with the power in their hands and about to be exercised when the protective system is to be wiped from our statute books conscious of the fallacy of its position the democratic party seeks a way to escape and the president of the united states and the democratic leader in this house now intimate that reduction in the cost of living will be gradual the democratic party now faces under its platform and its promises the duty of giving to the people under this bill cheaper food and cheaper clothes and at the same time maintain for the farmer good prices for his products and to the workingman the present or better scale of wages for his labor and to the employer such economic conditions as shall enable him to continne his business on such remunerative basis as that he may maintain it on terms of equality between himself his employees and the purchasing public i shall not now take the time to present the glaring inconsistencies of this bill nor the failure of the theory upon which it is supposed to be based nor even the method by which it has been constructed the payne bill was severely criticized both because of the alleged method of its creation as well as for its rates this criticism was expressed in many ways but perhaps by none better than the writer of the following in the north american review the methods by which tariff hills are constructed now become all too familiar and throw a significant light on the character of the legislation involved debate in the houses has little or nothing to do with it the process by which such a 1 11l is made is private not public because the reasons which underlie many of the rates imposed are private the stronger faction of the ways and means committee of the house makes up the preliminary bill with the assistance of experts whom it permits the industries mostly concerned to supply for its guidance the controlling members of the committee also determine what amendments if any shall be accepted either from the minority faction of the committe or from the house itself it permits itself to be dictated to if at all only by the imperative action of a party caucus this was penned by the then president of princeton university now the occupant of the white house what he now thinks of tariff making in the light of practical experience must fully confirm his preconceived notions however after all the democratic party will be judged not so nch by the methods employed in framing this bill as by the results accomplished by the bill itself it is an experiment which our democratic friends insist upon trying they are responsible but the people at large must suffer the consequences of their failure the great state of pennsylvania with its widely diversified interests has ever stood for the policy of protection the ftrmer and wage earner the merchant and the inanufacturer have all been the recipients of beneficence my state took the initiative in protective tariff legislation and the enactment of september 20 1785 is said to have furnished the model for the first tariff law enacted by the federal government in 17s9 the preamble to pennsylvanias tariff law reads as follows sec 1 whereas divesuseful and beneficial arts and manufactures have been gradually introduced into pennsylvania and the same have at length risen to a very considerable extent and perfection in so much that during the late war between the united states of america and great britain when the importation of european goods was much interrupted and often very difficult and uncertain the artisans and mechanics of this state were able to supply in the hours of need not only large quantities of weapons and other implements but also ammunition and clothing without which the war couldnot have been carried on whereby their oppressed country was greatly benefited and relieved sec 2 and whereas although the fabrics and manufactures of europe and other foreign parts imported into this country in times of peace may be afforded at cheaper rates than they can be made here yet good policy and a regard to the wellbeing of divers useful and industrious citizens who are employed in the making of like goods in this state demand of us that moderate duties be laid on certain fabrics and manufactures imported which do most interfere with and which if no relief be given will undermine and destroy the useful manufactures of the like kind in this country for this purpose i confess allegiance to that school of political thought upon the tariff question which has sought to place the interests of a great people above the petty graspings of mere partisanship a tariff policy which was bequeathed to us by our colonial ancestry and to the support and construetion of which the state of pennsylvania contributed thaddeus stevens a whig william d kelly a republican and samuel j randall a democrat these great men each in his way and time believed in and advocated protection to american industries here i this house these distinguished men upheld the american system and saw their hopes justified by constructive laws which they helped to pass and this country grow and prosper under the influence of beneficial tariff legislation in the days of randall we were practically united in pennsylvania on the tariff question democrats and republicans alike agreed that protection was necessary and should be sustained as a national institution our people believed in protection as a patriotic duty it was the sam randall democrats who in this house defeated the morrison horizontal tariff bill that spelled free trade that this policy has been beneficial to the united states one has only to place in evidence the industrial and commercial history of this country during the greater part of the last 50 years when with the exception of 4 years we had protectivetariff laws during the 4 years exception18931897we had a democratic administration and a democratic tariff and those who remember the suffering and misery of those 4 years do not want to return to the conditions then prevailing what is true of our entire country is also true of pennsylvania nothing can bless or injure other sections of this land without having a like effect upon the people of pennsylvania with our 8 000 000 people within a mighty domain of nearly 29 000 000 acres of land we have improved the magnificent opportunities offered by natural resources and the wisdom of selfpreserving laws to place the factory near the farm to give manifold and diversified employment to both capital and labor and to furnish a home market for the products of our husbandmen and beyond the limits of our own state we have found an enlarged home market for our excess products in exchange for which we have bought the products of our sister states that our people need but do not produce thus have we helped to enrich not only ourselves but our fellow americans in other states as well buying from foreign countries only those articles which are not produced here this has been and is possible only under laws embodying the protective principle this bill now before us however proposes to change our system and to subject our farmers in pennsylvania and other states and our artisans manufacturers and business men and their employees to the ruinous policy of foreign competition its framers tell us that the farmers are not interested in or desirous of a duty on their products that there is no good reason why farmers should fear from competition with the farmers of canada or of any other contry and that it would make no difference to the farmer either in the price he receives or the extent of his market but it would they claim cheapen farm products to the people in the cities if anybody thinks seriously that the farmers of this country want free trade in farm products and are indifferent as to protection he has only to refer to the recent revolt among the farmers against the canadian reciprocity treaty that treaty had for its purpose mutual commercial relations its chief purpose from the standpoint of those representing the united states in its negotiation was to reduce the cost of farm products to people in our cities and towns in exchange for certain concessions from canada which would open canadas market to our manufactured products our western farmers saw in this treaty a flooding of our markets with canadian wheat oats barley and other cereals and our eastern farmers saw injury to them in canadian garden truck poultry eggs milk butter and the like they rose up almost as one man against the treaty and the great agricultural papers and magazines opposed it as injurious to them as the farmers thought the canadian reciprocity treaty would be it at least did not propose to throw away entirely our home market without exacting some conditions favorable to our own people but the assault upon agriculture in this bill has not the saving grace of reciprocity for there is no compensation to any american industry for the losses inflicted upon our farmers by it this bill represents the logical position of the democratic party they supported as one man the reciprocity treaty because as they said it was a step in the right direction and they also voted against the repeal of the reciprocity hill and now they come along with a bill which goes farther thmn did the treaty and opens wide the door of our splendid home market to an invasion of canadian farm products if the farmers of the east and west rebelled at the polls against the treaty what shall be their attitude toward this bill i will leave this to our freetrade friends to answer for the farmers of pennsylvania i think i can say with certainty that they believe in protection they would believe in protection even if they themselves were not affected thereby for our farmers are unselfish in desiring a policy that they know will protect wage earners in our industries the farmers know that if those wage eaners aire thrown out of employment or have their wages reduced as the result of a tariff law that will encourage foreign importations as was the case under the last democratic tariff law then the farmer will lose his principal customer for when the mills and mines and factories are idle or running half time and wages are reduced the farmers suffer along with the workingmen farm values then become depressed farm products become a drug on the market notwithstanding the fact that the number of farms in pennsylvania decreased 2 2 per cent from 1900 to 1910 according to the united states census reports the acreage of improved farm land 4 1 per cent and the average size of farms 1 6 acres farm property including land buildings implements and machinery and live stock the latter including domestic animals poultry and bees increased in value during the same period 201 646 000 or 19 2 per cent these facts indicate the wonderful prosperity enjoyed by our farmers throughout the decade in which we had for seven years the dingley tariff law and for three years the present law and let me say here that the farmers of pennsylvania enjoyed no more than their fair share of the general prosperityit was not at the expense of the consumers of farm products for the farmers received but a just price as the reward of their industry in 1910 69 4 per cent of all the farms in pennsylvania were operated by their owners and part owners 3 5 per cent by managers and 27 1 per cent by tenants the percentage for owners and for managers being higher and that for tenants lower than in 1900 the owner class is increasing and the tenant class decreasing the total number of farms owned in whole or in part by the operators in 1910 was 164 229 of which number 112 156 were reported as free from mortgage indebtedness according to the report of the united states department of agriculture the value of all live stock in pennsylvania in 1910 was 163 000 000 divided as follows horses 619 000 mules 43 000 milch cows 1 146 000 other cattle 917 000 sheep 1 112 000 swine 931 000 the same authority shows that for the year 1911 pennsylvania farmers produced of the principal crops 63 858 000 bushels of corn valued at 43 423 000 17 462 000 bushels of wheat valued at 15 862 000 175 000 bushels of barley valued at 114 000 4 304 000 bushels of rye valued at 3 443 000 6 373 000 bushels of buckwheat valued at 4 397 000 15 120 000 bushels of potatoes valued at 14 062 000 3 148 000 tons of bay valued at 62 690 000 and 65 320 000 pounds of tobacco valued at 6 205 400 farmers of pennsylvania also produced in addition to the above staple crops according to united states census figures for the year 1909 vegetables not including potatoes to the value of 10 014 000 nursery products valued at 4 725 987 small fruits valued at 1 175 000 orchard fruits of which apples contributed about fivesixths of the quantity worth 8 678 000 grapes and nuts valued at about 1 000 000 dairy products exclusive of milk and creim used on the farm producing 42 809 000 of which 15 668 000 represents the value of butter the statistics as to wool production are incomplete but show a value of 1 306 000 the fowls of pennsylvania farmers in 1909 numbered 17 485 000 valued at 9 278 000 and they produced 70 903 000 dozens of eggs valued at 15 658 000 to produce their crops pennsylvania farmers according to the same authority for the same year paid 25 611 838 for labor on 63 per cent of the farms reporting which is one of the greatest relative increases in agriculture in that state during the decade 1899 to 1909 about onefourth of this amount was expended for labor in form of rent and board for feed of 64 per cent of farms reporting there was spent 19 203 160 and 0 801 605 for fertilizer now in the pending underwood bill there is an evident attempt to play the city against the countryto appear to be doing something for the socalled ultimate consumer at the expense of the farmer it has been pointed out however by several gentlemen who have spoken that the farmer receives not more than 50 per cent of the prices paid for the products he sends to market and yet he has to contend with as many difficulties relatively in the production of his crops as do those who produce the things he has to buy we should not forget that canadian reciprocity was brought forward in the same spirit stress was lid upon the promise that it would cheapen food to the people in the congested centers of population just as you say this democratic bill will do but the farmers who were not getting a fair share of the prices exacted from the consumer protested against a policy that would add injury to insult the secretary of agriculture mr wilson after an exhaustive investigation of this subject had this to say fom the details that have been presented with regard to the increase of the prices of farm products between farmer and consumer the conclusion is inevitable that the consumer has no wellgroundedi complaint against the farmer for the prices that he pays after consideration of the elements of the matter it is plain that the farmer is not getting an exorbitant price for his products and that the cost of distribution from the time of delivery at destination by the railroad to delivery to the consumer is the feature of the problem of high prices which must present itself to the consumer for treatmsent jit requires money and brains to run a successful farm no other business i dare say is subjected to greater uncertainties and risk and to add to the farmers h lndicaps the additional task of competing with the products of foreigners in what is and siould be tlie asmerican farmers honie marketthe very best in the worldis to my mind economic shortsightedness amounting to folly i stand for protection to the farmer in preparing this bill its authors have endeavored by an illconcealed effort to keep some duties on representative raw farm products in order not altogether as they hope to incur the displeasure of american farmers yet at the same time greatly reducing or placing on the free list the finished products this is illustrated in the case of cattle which is dutiable at 10 per cent while meats go on the free list wheat furnishes another notable example on which is a duty of 10 cents a bushel and flour goes on the flee list the following table is a comparison of rates under the present protective law upon certain agricultural products and provisions

produce in few other states in the union has the advice of jefferson in 1816 that we must place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturist been so well heeded as in the great state of pennsylvania our varied and important natural resources have invited the establishument and growth of many industries we have within our borders raw materials such as oil coal iron ore timber limestone clay glass sand natural gas tobacco and so forth in large quantities which are used in manufacturing in 1909 according to the united states census report pennsylvania had 27 563 manufacturing establishments employing ass average of 1 002 712 persons during the year who received 560 524 000 in salaries and wages of the persons employed 877 543 were wage earners these establishments turned out products to the value of 2 626 742 000 to produce which materials costing 1 582 560 000 were utilized the value added by manufacture was thus 1 044 182 000 which figures best represent the net wealth created by manufacturing operations during tile last ceusus year to select the industries in pennsylvania that will be affected directly or indirectly by this bill would be to select practically all of them i will therefore append to my remarks a table specifying 94 industries or industry groups which had in 1909 a product in excess of 700 000 000 in value in addition to the industries presented in the table there are 2 893 other industries employing 56 433 wage earners the value of whose products wans 211 025 000 plus the value addbl by manufacture of 75 276 000 of the total number of establishments in all industries combined only 21 3 per cent were under corporate ownership in 1909 as against 78 7 per cent under all other forms one of the most remarkable illustrations of the benefits to be derived from a protective tariff is to be found in the tinplate and terneplate industry in this country prior to 1889 says the united states census reports on manufactures the industry was of minor importance but by 1899 it had assumed such proportions that in the twelfth census reports it was for the first time classed as a separate industry it will be remembered that before the passage of the mckinley tariff law we were practically at the mercy of english manufacturers of tin plate from 1871 to 1891 we imported into this country 3 622 750 gross tons of tin plates the foreign value of which was 307 341 404 the mckinley bill put a duty of 1 85 and 2 2 cents per pound upon tin plates according to gauge this duty went into effect july 1 1891 what was the result importations which in the fiscal year 1891 were 1 036 489 074 pounds valued at 35 746 920 fell off in the fiscal year 1894 to 454 160 826 pounds valued at 11 969 518 and although the development of the industry was arrested by the wilson law of 1894 which cut the rates about onehalf the encouragement again accorded it by the restoration of the mckinley rates by the dingley act of 1897 enabled the industry to grow in this country and keep pace with the cousumption until now we produce practically all of the tin plate consumed here this has been done with no material increase in price so that the consumer has not suffered in the least the industry has been transferred to this country it has given direct employment to many thousands with american wages and to thousands in allied and kindred industries how did this tariff on tin plate affect pennsylvania let me answer by quoting again from an official authority the united states censts report of 1910 prior to 1889 the industry was of minor importance but by 1889 it was classed as a separate industry in the manufacture of these products pennsylvania rasks first among the states reporting more than 50 per cent of the total product of the united states in 1909 here is an industry in my state just 20 years old employing upward of 50 000 people turning out products worth 25 000 000 a year paying 1 400 000 in wages which never would have been established but for a protective tariff and yet democratic statesmen including mr cleveland characterized the duty on tin plate as robbery and idiotic statesllnliship this bill reduces the duty on tin and terne plates from 26 74 per cent the equivalent ad valorem under the present law to 20 per cent ad valorem on which our democratic friends hope to increase the revenue froln these articles and this can only mean increased importations to a market now supplied by our own establishnients where there is already competition pennsylvania holds the first place among the mining states in 1 909 its mining industries gave employment to 405 685 persons more than onethird of all persons employed in all mining enterprises in the united states the net value of the mine products of pennsylvania in that year was 345 960 603 the expenses of operating and development were 300 977 955 of which 210 531 202 was expended for salaries and wages the principal industry of the statecoal mininggave employiuent to 173 263 wage earners in the anthracite fields and 184 408 in the bituminous regions the net value of the combined product of coal was 296 396 507 almost equally divided the net value of petroleum and natural gaswell products was 36 126 096 which together with the value of coal constituted 96 1 per cent of the total net value of mining products in the state even if it were desirable it is impossible to refer in greater detail to the manifold industries of the state of pennsylvania n hich will be more or less affected by this bill that i have referred to them at all is merely for the purpose of calling attention to their great magnitude and to show at a glance the stupendous growth of farming manufacturing and minling in the state of pennsylvania a state whose people have always stood for protection because they have had material evidences of the wisdom of that policy but i share in the apprehension that exists in that state today that this bill which departs from the protective policy will affect disastrously the welfare of the industries of pennsylvania upon whom our people are wholly depesident and from which they are receiving benefits that enable them to live according to our american standards our people would rather bear those ills such as they have and hold fast to the substance of good times steady employment and good wages

amendment to compel the navy department to cease purchasing 12inch armorpiercing shells until they had proven that these 12inch shells could penetrate 10 inches of armor at a distance of 12 000 yards now let us see how the armorpiercing shell acts on the water this diagram is supposed to illustrate the aitmorpiercing shell fired from this gun pointed to strike the water near the vessel that is fired at if it strikes the water at this point it ricochets over the vessel if it does not ricochet it explodes instantly on contact with the water and the shot is lost it is a miss suppose this armorpiercing shell hits this is the angle of the trajectory and you see it comes over and strikes at an angle to the armor it does not strike the armor plate squarely we have been experimenting at indianhead with different charges of powder firing armorpiercing shells for years by these experiments at short distances they got a theoretical trajectory and because they pierced through armor plate under experimental conditions they have considered for years that they could pierce armor plate at 6 miles distance or 12 000 yards but when they experimented by actually shooting these shells at 12 000 yards they could not pierce the armor our subcommittee on armor and arnament of the committee on naval affairs and otherssaw this it is of record and everyone should be willing to admit it nevertheless it is insisted that we must go on building millions of dollars worth of those armorpiercing shells of the same alleged type that thes have been using we want them to experiment with this explosive shell which we have demonstrated will do as shown in this diagram notice this trajectory suppose this shell strikes near the target it will run on the water and will not ricochet and then it will sink and explode if it explode within 1 5 or 20 feet of the vesseland this has been experi mented with and provenit will cave inthat part of the vessel below the water line again if it hits the vesselfairly it will explode 180 pounds of a powerful explosive with disastrous results to the ship for 16 years the inventor of this shell has been working to get it before the attention of the navy department and has met with remarkable and almost inexplicable obstacles that was what that amendment was for the other dayto force these people to stop buying these armorpiercing shells of 12inch diameter until they demonstrated that they have an armorpiercing shell that will pierce armor at 12 000 yards and be an effective projectile the ex perience in europe shows that 12 000 yards is the

has been carrying out experiments on this question for the last two years and i have been the chairman of the special subcommittee conducting these ordnance experiments these experiments have covered the comparative strength and effectiveness of two types of shell designed for two types of attack the subject is still under investigation i will point out in a few moments just how far we have progressed in the investigation the investigation of the armorpiercing projectile has been substantially completed we have not made public and do not wish to have made public the detailed results of that investigation but i think in view of the statement of the gentleman from massachusetts the last time we were discussing this bill and the general impression produced by him today as to the power of armorpiercing projectiles i think it is only proper to state in order that there may be no question as to the effectiveness of the armorpiercing shell that the experiments were conducted under battle conditions at 10 000 and 12 000 yards distance that the plates used were modern plates 8 inches and 10 inches in thickness these plates were substantially thinner than the plates on modern dreadnaughts and the guns used were the 40caliber guns on the aliahassee which are not quite as powerful as the 50caliber guns mounted on two of our dreadnaughts but the relation of target to gun was such that it made the test absolutely fair and the results must be considered conclusive i may say that in the attack on this target with armorpiercing shells not a single shell penetrated in a way to explode behind the armor not a single shell penetrated the armor intact without breaking up and this was true with respect to either the 8 or 10 inch armor at even the shortest range this test established the fact that it would have been impossible for these shells to send a fragment through the protective deck or into the vitals of any firstclass ship at that range i do not hesitate to state that if a dreadnaught had been there in the place of the target it would not have been put out of acticn i will go further than that it would not have been as far as its vitals are concerned even seriously injured we fired some eightyodd shots and made 26 hits i believe we could have continued to fire until we made 100 hits without sinking an actual ship anchored there in place of the target and placed like the target at right angles to the line of fire and under the most favorable conditions for the shell i wish to state without going into details which we do not wish to be 4iade

what i assume he intended as a solemn warning in the following language we have established a bureau of foreign and domestic commerce that goes far beyond anything that these gentlemen desire to obtain in their tariff board and it is well for the country to know it it not only has the power to investigate the question of cost either here or abroad the amount of imports and exports and american consumption but when a great manufacturing institution is ready to threaten its laborers with a reduction of wages because they say there has been adverse action and legislation in congress or to reflect on the action of the government of the united states that bureau has the power to walk into their offices and ascertain whether there is real reason for their cutting the rates of wages of their labor or whether it is merely a selfish attempt to put money into their own pockets the statement has been made that this tariff bill will act on labor and affect the wages of laboring men i give you notice now that when the men from whom you bring that message endeavor to grind labor in the interest of republican politics there is a bureau of this government that is going to ascertain the reason why applause on the democratic side i at the time the gentleman from alabama uttered these words he had been under a severe strain for nearly two weeks piloting his bill through the house he had been compelled to listen to some very severe criticism of the measure and to the perfectly sincere and very emphatic statements made by gentlemen on both sides of the aisle to the effect that the proposed legislation threatened the prosperity and in some cases the very existence of great industries and consequently the rate of wages and the employment of many people the gentleman from alabama is goodnatured and a good deal of a philosopher and yet these criticisms ad warnings quite nat urally somewhat disturbed his usual imperturbable equanimity he therefore had perhaps some license for a little extravagance of statement under ordinary circumstances i think the gentlenman would have hesitated to warn those engaged in enterprises threatened by his bill that they must continue to operate without any reduction of wages without regard to the financial loss that such operation might entail in the heat of debate the gentleman attempted to convey the impression that any suspension of business which might occur or reduction of wages that might follow would be purely for political purposes and based on this false and unfair hypothesis he proceeds to utter a warning entirely unwarranted under the circumstmces possibly the bluff of the gentleman from alabama can be forgiven in view of the condition of its utterance the morning papers bring us however notice of a

another notable address recently made to the senate naval affairs committee by mr willard s isham a military engineer and expert and the inventor of a torpedo shell mr isham makes five very specific charges of inefficiency against the united states navy these charges were made on september 30 publicly and in the presence of high officials of the navy and they have not been challenged explained nor denied the graveness of mr ishams charges can scarcely be overestimated if they are unjustified they ought to be proved untrue by tbe navy experts if they are true our navy administration needs immediate investigation and reorganization here is an official copy of mr ishams address to the naval affairs committee of the senate gentlemen the main purpose of this brief presentation is to direct attention to some of the many defects in the matdrlel of our navy which neutralizing many good points destroy the efficiency of our navy as a means of national defense a further purpose is to disclose some of the contributing causes that have resulted in present conditions in the expectation that when these are fully considered a searchini investigation of our national defenses will result since the time when our government was established it has been recognized that an efficient navy operating on the high sea was the most practical means for the protection of our long coast lines against hostile invasion a navy to accomplish this purpose must be able to intercept and overcome any convoyed force before a port suitable for a base could be secured and made defensible and since it is obviously impossible to determine in advance the objective point of attack of an enemy it is necessary that our navy to be efficient must possess eyes as it is recognized that a blind fighter could never accomplish much in a combat with an active enemy hence an important adjunct to a fleet consists in scout ships for scouring the seas and ascertaining the strength location direction and speed of an enemys expeditionary force so that he may be met by a suitable force at such a point and at such a time that a tactical advantage may be secured and a favorable result obtained we possess no ships capable of cruising as scouts at a distance from our battle fleet which could not be quickly destroyed by the faster and more powerfully armed battleships and battle cruisers of other navies hence at the door of those responsible for the condition of our navy is laid charge number 1 1 our navy is inefficient because of its inability to scout out an enemy on the high seas our battle fleets are made up of battleships in which speed has been sacrificed for armor plate and from a strategical or tactical standpoint are no better than floating fortresses as they can never force a battle upon an unwilling enemy or interfere with any of his movements moreover no part of a battle fleet can be safely detached as a flying base for cruisers destroyers or other fast ships acting as scouts sinoc they might be cut off and destroyed by a concentrated force of ships having superior speed and armament hence it is that our battle fleets must operate as an entity and must possess the force necessary to meet at any time or place the maximum force which an enemy can concentrate against them this condition also results from the second defect in our navy 2 we possess no ships capable of operating at such a distance from our battle fleets as to screen its formation and strength from the scout ships of an enemy because of this defect our fleets are compelled to be always ready and are as a consequence never ready to meet an enemy to the best advantage this defect makes the defense of our fleets impossible at night since it permits a hostile torpedo flotilla to hover about them at sundown like a pack of coyotes around a campfire ready to rush in when the conditions are favorable against this attack our battleships are powerless as shown by lord charles beresford in the betrayal page 02 no guns heavy or light will protect a battle fleet from torpedo attack at night the only effective method of protection is to employ a large number of small cruisers to clear a w~lde area about the battle fleet at sundown these cruisers do not exist in the requisite number the small cruiser force must be disposed so that they form a protecting screen distant 120 or 140 miles on all sides from the battle squadron by no other means is it possible to move a battle squadron at night without risking its destruction by the attack of torpedo craft rear admiral twining late chief of the bureau of ordnance stated in the house hearings march 12 19 12 page 907 ithe torpedo boat continues to le held in great favor as a weapon of underwater attack and it must be admitted that no navy has at present an adequate system of defense against such attack if efficiently delivered torpedoes have been designed which can cut penetrate or displace the nets the searchlight is ineffective since a torpedo may be successfully launched at a range beyond its reach gunfire is ineffective against an invisible target and the torpedo boat can launch its weapon while still invisible to the gun the great naval expert percy scott who formerly championed the construction of battleships now declares them to be worthless and defenseless against underwater attack the european war thus far has shown that no commander dares to expose a battleship to underwater attack hence the charge is laid and should be investigated 3 our battleships are defenseless in a fog or at night moreover the results thus far obtaimed as to the naval operations in the european war seem to indicate that heavy ships are defenseless by day against underwater attack notwithstanding this accumulation of evidence our technical boards still propose to construct slow battleships and one week from today bids will be opened for three such ships that will cost 45 000 000 and that an investigation will show to be as worthless and as antiquated as the flintlock musket these defects in our battleships result from the sacrifice of active aggression for passive resistance a vital sacrifice in speed for an unnecessary increase in armor plate because of this our ships are compelled to fight fleets which make them an easy prey for the torpedo and which fired at the line of battleships will in one case out of four hit and sink a ship the napoleonic maxim that the thicker the grass the faster it is mown applies with especial force to naval warfare this is one of the fruits of armorplate domination in the construction of our navy had our battleships been constructed with such speed that they could cruise as fighting units they would have nothing to fear on the high seas from torpedo attack let us examine the advantages which this excess armor plate has given our ships since the remotest ages the art of war and the implements of warfare have developed according to certain immutable principles for example the boy david slew the giant goliath because lie could select a range for his attack where his sling was destructive but which range the slowmoving goliath could not lessen so as to make his ponderous sword and spear effective this principle has been expounded for centuries and employed to secure victories in all ages and it was recently reaffirmed as the basis of an argument for the sale of the idaho and mississippi that they were outranged by the larger guns of foreign fast ships hence charge 4 is laid and should be investigated 4 thirtytwo of our older battleships carrying guns of equal or lesser power than those in the idaho are inefficient for the purposes for which they were designed because they are outranged by foreign ships having guns of superior range and possessing superior speed a corrollary of this principle is that the effect of a missile weapon is not dependent upon its ultimate range but upon its destructive range the guns of the idaho and mississippi and our other 32 ships having the slime armament fire shell weighing 870 pounds about 22 000 yards yet these shell can not destroy a battleship at even onehalf this range which general fact is stated not only in the last british naval annual and in other technical journals but also has been proven by tests carried out by a special committee of congress and reported to congress by the chairman capt hobson on april 80 of the present year admiral twining in testimony referred to stated that hits could be made at a range of 16 000 yards the british navy last december sunk the battleship empress of india at over 16 000 yards and the account of the test in the naval institute proceedings for april of the present year states that holes were blown in her like lock gales showing the employment of torpedo shell since a p shell never make a hole larger than their diameter since then torpedo shell are used abroad that are effective at 16 000 yards or up to the limit of range fixed by visual conditions as stated by admiral twining the question naturally arises why these 32 battleships of our navy are not supplied with such shell so as to prevent them from being outranged as it is stated they would be in combat with foreign ships several types of torpedo shell were brought out in this country nearly 20 years ago the war department perfected one i presented one but neither type has been adopted the cry of danger was raised against one of these types that charge would have been accepted as honest lid either of the other types of torpedo shell been adopted and against which no such charge could be brought either of these shell could destroy any battleship without even exploding in contact with it as was established by experiments carried out by gen abbott nearly 20 jcars ago it was also proven by tests made with the army shell against a caisson representing a battleship and furnished by the navy department an account of which test is contained in ordnance and gunnery by lissak page 583 which shows that this shell would destroy a battleship at even a distance of 15 feet from it hence charge 5 is laid and should be investigated 5 ordnance officers of this country for the past 15 or 20 years have been in possession of safe torpedo shell that could destroy any ship at any range within the limit fixed by visual and other conditions but notwithstanding this such shell have not been adopted for the service and our ships have not been constructed either to employ them or meet the change that would result if other navies adopted them tests of these shell have shown that by means of them not only can ships be sunk at extreme range but also irrespective of their armor protection as their most favorable point of attack is below the water iire has this recognized destructive effect of torpedo shell which discounts the use of armor plate been the cause of the vigorous opposition to their adoption lias their use been opposed because their adoption would at once extend the destructive range of all the primary guns on all our battleships and thereby prevent such ships from ever becoming obsolete has their use been opposed because their adoption would destroy the basis of the permanent narval building program so dear to mnany those back of this opposition should be permitted to give the reasons therefor and these reasons should be weighed and tested by a searching investigation the immediate cafise for this request for a hearing in the hop of securing an investigation has been the arrogant act of the naval chief of ordnance who has refused to carry out tests with either of two types of torpedo shell in which i am interested and as requested by the house subcommittee on ordnance tests but who has at the same time carried out a test with one of these shell in utter disregard of the wishes of either the house committee or myself which for highhanded disregard for the interests of the navy and of this country stands without parallel in the history of his department and i am informed having thereby secured thle material for an unfavorable repoert the caisson employed in the test was blown up and destroyed thcreby preventing further tests to disprove the inaccuracy of the reports and conclusions obtained and uttered by the department it is recognized that a saw may be prov en to be worthless if tested as a means to drive nails likewise a hlammer may he proven worthless as a means for cutting off timber but a test to prove their efficiency shouldbho made under such conditions as they are designed tbeueadiaminformed bymany members of congress who received invitations to be present at a test requested by the house committee on ordnance tiests that they exp~ecied such test to take place i am also informed that if the subterfuge of blowing lip the caisson has been resorted to in order to prevent the result of an honest test from stopp ing contracts for battleships or shell the blame will be placed where it belongs the issue is not the isham shell or anybodys shell in particular the question is whether the ordnance officers shall prevent the use of any torpedo shell liecause they lessen thc demand for armor plate and for new ships this issue it is submitted should he decided by an nvestlgallon and by honest tests and it is believed that it will be so decided believing that the few serious charges herein made can be established by the honest officers composing 05 per cent of those in the service and that a searching invcestigation will result in great good to our navy i respectfully request that such an investigation lbe made it was my privilege to go dowvn the bay this week to witness some experiments with at shell containing a high explosive the invention of the mr isham referred to above to my mind the experients demonstrated the excellence of the invention and ipoint unmistakably to a changealmost a revolutionia naval wa rffa re up to this time it has been found impossible to devise a form of shell which would not skip along the surface of the water or ricochet as it is technically called t his falct niade it impossible to hit a ship below the water line with a shell alnd hence it was unnecessary to put armor plate below that line hence the submerged portion of the ship is especially weak against attack and a hard blow delivered under tile water is usually fatal this together with the secrecy wvith which its blowv can be delivered constitute the miain reasoits for thle sublmarine and the torpedo from shells wvhich ref use to go into tihe water before exploding the submarine is of course practically imniune but if a shell could be found to enter the water anti explode under the water the subanarine would be another othelloits occupation would be gone that is just what mr isham thas accomplished by a device which is unerring in accuracy and so siniple thatt one wonders why it wvas not discovered before every shell not fired at too short a range enters tile wvater on contact and equipped with a time fuse travels tinder the water a distasice of fromt 100 to 200 feet before exploding no shlip amnd no subimarine within a distance of 15 or 20 feet from this shell at the moment of expiosion could survive the effect is manifest the attacke is carried direct to tile weakest point of the ship and irreparable damage is done in this way every shlell becomes ai mine anti it is difficult to conceive of a defense against it such a shell takes the place of the torpedo anid in addition possesses tremendous advantages over it in the first place its cost is but a small fraction of the cost of the torp~edo in the next place it is far more practicable it will travei through the air in 15 seconds a tilstance which it would take tile torpedo at least 5 minutes to travel through the water in 5 minutes the ship may change its course s~o as to miss the torpedo but if th~e high explosive sheli is 1properly aimed the ship canm not in 15 seconds gain anything by change of position and in addition during the 5 minutes the torpedo is making its journey at least 15 shells could lie fired from a single gull and in the third place the shell has for its target the whole ship bothl above and below the water line whereas the torpedo has only the part belowv the ater line i do not believe we are in danger of b eing involved in wvar very soon i have the most atbundant confidence in the ability of the president and secretary of state bryan to avoid such a calamity it would be almost unpardonable that not even one of the great nations reamained at peace but if we

with poverty in addition to the disability of poor health when these men enlisted at their countrys call the property owners of this country made a solemn pledge that the soldiers their widows and

this or of any statute granting federal aid will not solve the problem indeed more will have to be done before good roads will be built throughout the country unpopular as it may seem i firmly believe that good permanent roads will only be a reality when the land adjacent to or in close proximity to good permanent roads is assessed for a proportion of the benefit which the building of such roads will give to such land the local authorities can not and will not alone build good permanent roads in any state the national government can not and should not alone embark upon such a project but i believe the final solution of this question will be the joint action by the federal government the state or local authorities and the owners of the land that lies in close proximity to the permanent roads constructed by such joint action we can eventually build a system of good roads throughout the country that will meet the demands of commerce and will be responsive to public sentiment"],
