and so forth of which example after example could be given are only too clear proof of this fact furthermore section 5 of the bill lays down a general policy with regard to stabilizing of prices in order to protect the consumer and at the same time safeguard the existing channels of distribution theoretically the latter were supposed to be safeguarded under the terms of the price control act but in actual administration as i pointed out before thousands of retailers wholesalers and processors have been lorced to the wall it is worth while at this point to quote the pertinent section of that act section 2 h the powers granted in this section shall not be used or made to operate to compel changes in the business practices cost practices or methods or means or aids to distribution established in any industry except to prevent circumvention or evasion of any regulation order price schedule or requirement under this act in view of what has happened in the last 6 months this particular mandate of congress seems to have been forgotten altogether there is no mention whatever of subsidies in the jenkins bill under the existing powers which have been transferred to the food administrator subsidies may still be granted in accordance with existing law subsidies may be necessary because of the severe dislocations in our economy which have already taken place but if subsidies are undertaken they should be undertaken in such ways and in such amounts as the congress itself prescribes after receiving the benefit of the recommendations of the administrator i was shocked to learn in our debate last week that the administration was contemplating the utilizing of lendlease appropriations for subsidy purposes i was even more shocked to find that suggestions have been made that the existing appropriations of lendlease the war department and the navy department might be drawn on to piece out reconstruction finance corporation funds for subsidy purposes at the very same moment that mr chester davis was appearing before a congressional committee to ask for an additional billion dollars for subsidies through the commodity credit corporation just what form subsidies would have taken from these other government agencies i do not know but perhaps they would have taken the form indicated in the recent department of agriculture release which showed that the war department was paying 10 cents a hundredweight over ceiling prices for potatoes in the state of maine and 5 cents per 50pound sack over ceiling prices in the state of texas thereby creating in this scarce commodity a governmental black market is it any wonder when the government itself is allowed to pay higher prices in openmarket operations than are the legitimate trades that hoarding should result and that farmers should feel entirely free to sell to the highest bidder whoever he may be the creation of a single control over food administration as provided for in the jenkins bill does not guarantee a solution of our problem of food supply and distribution but it certainly represents the first and basic step in our approach to a solution of this problem the bill would allow of an administrative setup which could function the present setup cannot function even though it were manned by the greatest experts in the world the jenkins bill is a stable base from which unified policies could be directed it is quite possible that the major pricing policies of the 0 p a will have to be reconsidered as a whole it is quite possible in accordance with the british and canadian experience that the government will have to take complete control of a few essential foodstuffs and carry them from the farm through to the consumer with or without subsidy in order to insure even distribution and a noninflationary price to the consumer no one can be didactic as no one knows with certainty as to what the supply of foodstuffs in this country will be after the coming crop season the british experience is not necessarily a criterion for our own administrative policies because the british begin with the fundamental knowledge that they must count on shortages in all foodstuffs we hope that our situation will not be as drastic as this we do know that there will be shortages in meat and dairy products we do know that we shall probably have some surplus of cereals but even the latter are being eaten into rapidly and a poor crop season might well wipe out the accumulated stocks on which we had counted as our principal background for the feeding of starving populations in the liberated countries however there are some things that we can foretell with accuracy now as long as the 0 p a keeps a ceiling price of 1 05 on corn and a ceiling of between 13 and 14 a hundred on hogs justso long will all the corn stay on the farms and be fed to the hogs with a ratio of this kind corn fed to hogs is worth 1 40 and no form of compulsion can force a farmer to ship it to the dairy herds of the east while it brings that price fed to thehog the dairy farmer in the east cannot get the requisite feed for his dairy herds he is told that he must produce milk at a price which in my state at least returns him no more than 89 percent of his cost of production in the face of these disparities to mention only one glaring example the consumers of milk including the hospitals and our children may soon find themselves faced with acute shortagesshortages which a more intelligent administration and distribution of our food supplies could easily have avoided in the brief time at my disposal it is obviously impossible to cover the whole field of rationing and distributing of foodstuffs i hope soon again either in person or with the aid of my colleagues of the food study committee to bring to the attention of the congress the vital need of our making a start at once in the direction indicated by the jenkins bill we as congressmen cannot administerwe can only point out faults in

ask that this matter be deferred in some way until april 1until it can be settled we should take some time to see what has been going on here is one case upon which this ruling is based but if you get a hypothetical opinion which is based upon a hypothetical question i do not think it will answer the question"], [0.000553131103515625, 0.5005531311035156, 1, "i do not think the gentleman meant that what the gentleman meant and what i am sure he will agree to was that on this subject that has taken our committee nearly 5 years to understand he and the other members of the subcommittee are experiencing the same difficulty we experienced for a long time after we began this work the point i want to make is this and i want our distinguished colleague from north carolina to listen to these observations i think there will be no contest about the fact that these charges are substantially correct i think that in the great majority of the cases these government employees will agree as they have agreed before our committee in the past 10 days that they were associated and affiliated with these various organizations or that they were the authors of various books pamphlets and speeches expressing certain sentiments which i have heretofore read to the house and which in my opinion clearly show that at least at one time they were not in favor of our form of government in no case has the author publicly repudiated his views as previously expressed we are not trying these people for crimes we are not seeking to impose any penalty it is just a question in my mind like this here is a man who not once but we will say upon a number of occasions has openly associated and affiliated with an organization which our committee unanimously found to be subversive and in passing let me say we have three republicans and four democrats upon our committee and everyone knows we have had some outstanding progressives on our committee such as the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from california and all of our reports with the possible exception of one were unanimous findings of the committee but you have more evidence than that the department of justice was unwilling to accept our findings so they established their own interdepartmental committee and this committee pursued its own independent inquiry into what organizations were subversive and they reached certain conclusions that were stronger than our findings so you have our committees findings you have the department of justice findings and you have the fact that certain government employees were affiliated with organizations that are subversive it seems to me that if you would require any committee to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a man is subversive or even to prove that he is a communist that you could never accomplish anything because manifestly the members of the communist party are secret members neither the f b i nor our committee nor any other agency has ever been successful in securing the membership list of the communist party all members of the communist party are instructed to perjure themselves they do not hesitate under oath to deny their affiliation with the communist party although we have conclusive proof that there are approximately 165 000 duespaying members so it would seem to me that in dealing with merely the question of whether or not these people shall hold appointive jobs that we in the congress should establish a policy that when any government employee knowingly or carelessly affiliates or associates with a subversive organization that he should not be given employment in our government let me show you how simple this is in the case of nazi organizations our committee of course has exposed a number of nazi organizations in this country suppose these 38 government employees had been officers and members of the germanamerican bund how long do you think it would take to strike them from the pay roll of this government yet the communist party by the findings of our committee and by the findings of the attorney general is just as revolutionary just as disloyal and unpatriotic as the germanamerican bund"], [0.0006582438945770264,

i want to get to the particular bill that was filed yesterday which i think takes care of the most serious part of the cost of living increase in this country at the moment as has been pointed out many times subsidies can be given many different names there is one form however which differs quite radically from the others most subsidies involve an easily computable loss to the government the particular type that i have in mind is different in that it does not necessarily involve any loss this is the socalled support price it is a device whereby the government guarantees to buy from the producer all of his crop not sold in the open market at a fixed price sufficiently high to insure maximum production this device was used in the last war by the united states grain corporation it is being used today in connection with certain necessary commodities the government in making this offer to purchase in effect guarantees a minimum price if the government is obliged to purchase a large part of the product it may or may not resell at a loss assuming that there is a demand for that particular product there is no reason why it should sell at a loss if there is no adequate demand for the product the support price should probably not have been fixed in the first instance this is a form of subsidy which it is of the utmost importance to maintain because the encouragement of maximumfood production today in many lines is absolutely vital its noninflationary effect is best stated by mr ickes in his letter to prentiss brown of april 6 1943 in which after advocating an increase in price of crude oil he made the following statement i recognize fully the dangers of price inflation but price inflation connotes an unwarranted rise in prices without promise of increasing supply my fear is that unless we are prepared now to permit some increases in oil prices in order to stimulate increases in our available supplies our reserves will continue to be depleted at such a pace that only a drastic increase in pricesperhaps several dollars a barrel as contrasted with a tenth of that amount if we act nowwill be required to find and produce the oil we are certain to need both during the war and after i am confident that congress is strongly disposed to afford every possible incentive to increasing production and in any discussion of subsidies we need to keep clearly in mind the fundamental differences between providing incentives to production and possible subsidies of one sort or another to that end on the one hand and subsidies designed to roll back retail prices on the other hand it is the latter which are now under fire and which are open to such grave objection what class in the community is today suffering from increases in retail food prices obviously it is the person of small fixed income such as the retired school teacher retired civil service employee the person with a small annuity the recipient of oldage assistance and so forth that is the personand as a group it is not an inconsiderable groupwhich is being badly caught today in the price squeeze most state and governmental employees have been given a wage increase to compensate for the squeeze most industrial workers have received wage increases which go far beyond the extent of the squeeze but nothing has as yet been done for the category of individuals such as i have mentioned in order to care for this group i have filed a bill h r 2997 which i shall also offer as an amendment to the bill reported by the committee on banking and currency increasing the borrowing power of the commodity credit corporation as reported by the committee the intent of their bill is to forbid the types of objectionable subsidy to which i have referred above but no provision whatever is made for the person who is being squeezed my bill is very brief and simple it authorizes the war food administrator to put into effect a plan whereby stamps which can be used for the purchase of specified foodstuffs will be issued to certain eligible persons the different state welfare authorities as designated by the governors of the respective states will have the power to certify eligibles within the following three classifications first persons whose family income has not increased by 20 percent or more since january 1 1939 and whose income is 1 000 or less for a single person 1 200 for a married person and 100 additional for each dependent second persons who can show that 50 percent or more of their income must be applied for necessary nutritive food third institutions or individuals who maintain persons in the first two categories or who maintain foster homes for children stamps can be issued to any individual only to the amount of 25 percent of his estimated budget for food and are payable to food distributors from the office of the commodity credit corporation stamps can be used in payment of only such foods as the administrator with the approval of the surgeon general of the united states specifies i have estimated that there are roughly 12 000 000 persons in the united states who would come within the eligible categories mentioned in the bill i have estimated further that the average amount spent by each of these individuals per year for food is between 200 and 250 the value of stamps to which they would be entitled would therefore come to 50 or 60 per year the total cost would run between 600 000 000 and 700 000 000 a yeara figure approximating that which the government is now spending on the attempted rollbacks on butter coffee and meat and a figure likewise approximating the cost of the recent bill which we passed in this house providing for overtime pay for government civilian employees let me emphasize certain features of this bill in the first place eligibles would be certified by existing welfare organizations in the respective states and the actual manpower required for this operation is almost negligible because the necessary machinery and personnel are already in existence the administrative problem would not be great and no new federal bureaucracy would haveto be created the administrator could of course in the issuing of stamps refuse to accept state certifications as beyond the scope of the broad limitations placed on eligibles in this bill there would therefore be little danger of padded eligible lists second a single stamp is all that would be required which could be printed in such denominations as the administrator might deem best and which would be simpler to handle than the blue and orange stamps used in the department of agricultures surplus commodity stamp plan third by making stamps in effect currency valid for the purchase of certain foodstuffs the administrator and the surgeon general of the united states could insure that they would be used only for the most plentiful or the most nutritive foodstuffs available at any given time in our markets i am convinced that the adoption of such a plan would be infinitely less inflationary and infinitely more desirable from a social point of view than the consumer subsidy schemes which it is apparent the administration wishes to try two billion dollars appears to be the minimum figure so far advanced as the annual cost for the latter and even if completely successful from an administrative point of view which i would greatly doubt would net each individual in this country perhaps 1 to 1 50 per month in savings no matter how rich or poor they were however if the administration is expectingto rely on food subsidies alone to stabilize or roll back to any given date the cost of food the cost might well run into the tens of billions to say nothing of the new army of federal personnel required for administrative purposes"],

gentleman from louisiana put in the record and which pointed out a new policy on the part of the veterans administration which seems to be of sufficient importance so that it should be spoken about on this occasion that policy is one of adjudicating benefit claims of veterans before they are discharged ftom hospitals while they are there to go over their case to bring in their records and to go over the records and find out what their entitlements are and to grant those men their compensation before they leave the hospital if that could be done with regard to every single man who is hospitalized it would answer a great percentage of their problems i want to congratulate the veterans administration on this move i myself happen to have been the author of a bill in the last session which was enacted by the congress which provided in brief that a man who had been in active service and the circumstances of whose service could logically be assumed to have led to the disability from which he now suffered would be assumed to be suffering from a serviceconnected disability the reason that bill was necessaryand i do not think it has led to nearly the results i had hoped forbut the reason that bill was important was precisely because this policy was not followed to anything like the extent it should have been namely the policy of adjudicating veterans claims before they left the hospitals or at any rate before discharge we have got to have legislation of a farreaching character for the benefit of men in this war"]]}
