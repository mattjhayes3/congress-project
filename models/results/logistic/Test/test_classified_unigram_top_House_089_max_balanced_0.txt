17th district of ohio are being excluded by the present federal farm policy under secretary of agriculture john a schnittkers statements on which this figure is based show that not only are the small farmers being cut out by usda policy but that they are also expected to get out of farming schnittker recently said that usda polidy is aimedat achieving parity income for adequatesize farms but not neccisarily small farims when asked to define adequatesize schnittker said that they were those farms with more than 10 000 a year in sales of the 13 752 farms in the 17th district ofohio 11 017 of them do not gross 10 000 or more a year mr schnittker went on to say that todays farm programs have been designed slpecifically to provide price and income protection primarily to farmers on adequatesize farms it is not clearly understood and widely accepted that most small farmers in the united states cannot attain good incomes and living standards from farming alone many will expand to larger farms but more will not what this means is that the small farmer will be forced out of business and by the agriculture departments definition of small farmer it means that if the policy set forth is successful only 1 out of 5 will be around to farm and frequent the businesses in the farm towns and support the schools and do all the other things in the rural community that now has five times the number of people this statement shows that with the 10 000 dividing line four out of five of the farmers in the area which i represent and in which i live are on their way out of farming this may be clearly understood and widely accepted by the usda but it will be quite a shock to these 11 000 farmers statements by mr schnittker are part of the policy that not only expects these farmers to get off the farm but which is forcing them to here is what happens to the 17th district and its eight counties when this policy is applied the percentages show the farmers who do not fall into the category of the departments policy depending on the county the percentage of farmers who are being excluded varies from a low of 64 3 percent in wayne county to a high of 94 7 percent in guernsey county these figures are not pulled out of the air the basis for the percentages comes straight from under secretary schnittkers remarks the numbers of farmers who have gross sales of less than 10 000 a year are taken from the latest agricultural census reports 1964 compiled by the bureau of the census these reports also state the total number of farmers s6 it is easy to figure the percentage of farmers who are being cut out by federal farm policy here are the figures for the counties in the 17th district ashland 76 3 percent coshocton 85 5 percent guernsey 94 7 percent holmes 77 3 percent knox 79 3 percent licking 80 6 percent muskingum 91 1 percent and wayne 64 3 percent only one county out of eight has a percentage below 75 percent and three counties have more than 85 percent of the farms left out by the policy it is also interesting to note that slightly more than 70 percent of this eightcounty area is farmland so these figures do not represent only a small part of the area but a very significant partsignificant to me and to the others who live there but not evidently to the departmient of agriculture mr schnittkers statements explaining what the department plans to do should actually come as no surprise after all this is the same agency whose director orville freeman advisedcandidates to slip slide and duck all questions of inflation from the voters these statements make it even more clear that the department of agriculture is attempting to institute policies designed to slip slide and duck the small farmer right out of business secretary freeman himself has stated how many farmers will in effect survive his departments policies1 million this means that some 2 5 million american farmers will have to leave their farms and earn a living in some other area the same mr freeman also told the candidates that if they were backed into a corner and had to take sides on the question of inflation they would be better off if they chose the farmer instead of the housewife he said this is because the farmer is better organized when it comes to choosing sides maybe mr freeman and now mr schnittker had better make sure the side they choose wants them some 80 piercent of the farmers in the area where i am from might have different ideas these farmers large or small are going to remember that this same department is the one which lifts cheese import restrictions to the detriment of the american dairy farmer and uses defense department cutbacks on pork buying to control the hog prices and promotes beef imports in competition with american farmers and whose commodity credit corporation dumped millions of bushels of wheat and corn on markets which were then bringing the farmer only 80 percent of parity and finally the department which

established and the amount of the liability to each individual employee was capable of computation with reasonable accuracy it was thought that taxpayers accruing vacation pay under plans which did not meet the requirements of the strict accrual rule set forth in this ruling would utilize the new reserve provided by the code this ruling was initially made applicable to taxable years ending on or

had the mandate from the people as you say with the overwhelming support you claim it will now have particularly from your party why did not the continuation come back to our committee with the additional authorization why did you not point with pride to the record of ara during the time it has been in existence you have not seen anything in the record to that extent and we now have a

appropriations bill the discussion on page 7 which states the committee insists this year as it has in the past that maximum utilization be made of existing facilities the previously mentioned program of the department of defense for the efficient and economical utilization of the real property holdings of the department makes this essential the committee is not satisfied that the department is giving adequate consideration to the use of existing facilities including interservice as well as intraservice utilization of the military base structure or to the use of those available in the private economy this is particularly true with reference to headquarters and administrativetype facilities and to research and development facilities as well as to those required for the maintenance and operation of aircraft and weapon systems many of which are common to more than one military service in this regard along with other base closures the department of defense announced in november 1964 that larson air force base in the state of washington would be closed effective june 20 1966 the department of defense has since stated that the reason for closing the base will bring about an economic savings which can be made by consolidating the 462d strategic aerospace wing based at larson with another similar wing to be based at march air force base calif larson air force base is unique in that it is one of the finest operational aircraft bases in the strategic air command in addition to having a modern complex of structures formerly occupied by boeing aircraft co it has excellent airport facilities larson air force base is an integrated city with its own fire protection system utilities streets homes recreational centers and a variety of structures it has a modern hospital and dental clinic 1 335 modern housing units and two fine schools i believe the committee on appropriations therefore is entirely justified in its concern that the department of defense may not be giving adequate consideration to the use of existing facilities such as at larson air force base for other military utilization in lieu of new construction elsewhere today i intend to ask the secretary of defense whether the fullest possible consideration has been given to the utilization of larson air force base for such purposes as described on page 9 of the committee report which states the industrialtype facilities of the defense department have a twofold responsibility one of which is to provide for the maintenance repair and overhaul of military weapons systems during socalled peace time operations the other is to provide a mobilization base for rapid expansion in the event of war i believe that in view of the obvious military requirements of our nation in which we are being called upon to make sure that we are prepared to meet any eventualities as a result of our involvement in the vietnam conflict that we must make sure we are utilizing our existing facilities in a manner consistent with our nations purpose"]]}
