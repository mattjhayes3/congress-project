unlimited coinage by the amendment of 1853 the silver dollar remained the standard as it had been from the foundation of the government the law was amended at a time when europe was busily engaged in discussing the adoption of silver monometallism but when in no country under the sun was there a movement in favor of adopting gold monometallism this couitry had its monometallists at that period but they were silver monometallists they had studied chevalier and the writings of an english economist and were convinced that the latter was right in asserting that gold would soon be only fit for the dustpan then as now new england corporations were the head and front of the scarcemoney contingent waterpower companies down east in order to shield themselves against a deluge of cheap gold money stipulated in leasesthat so many ounces of fine silver instead of so many dollars should be paid to them by their customers for waterpower privileges if in that period moneylending corporations had been as numerous and powerful as they are now the movement in favor of the demonetization of gold which succeeded in germany holland and austria would have extended to the united states but the truth is that prior to 1873 no movement of the kind was ever heard of in american politics and the contention that almost immaterial amendments of the coinage laws dealing solely with details and in no way affecting the financial system of the country has any relation whatever to the question under discussion seems to me stupid and preposterous i declare that now and here for the first time the congress has under discussion a bill which effectually and entirely eliminates the silver dollar as money of ultimate payment and thereby definitively establishes the single gold standard here for the first time the leaders of the republican party boldly doff the mask i do not care to thrash over the history of the passage of the coinage law of 1873 further than to state that at the time of its passage there was no discussion of the great question which has since so largely occupied the time of civilized nations for twelve years prior to its passage no specie had circulated in the united states and none did circulate here until five years later nobody was thinking about the coinage laws the men of business who were then 30 years of age or less had never known anything but a paper currency and as for the members of this house and of the senate it is a wellestablished fact that they regarded the bill as a measure dealing with administrative details and in no way vitally affecting our monetary system divers and sundry financial measures have heretofore been brought forward scores have been introduced in this and the other branch of congress but now for the first time a bill favorably reported by a committee after full examination unequivocally committing the united states to the gold standard is the subject of debate in this house under the provisions of this bill the silver dollar and the greenbacks are to remain a legal tender for all debts public and private except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract just as greenbacks are but all forms of currency including silver dol lars and silver certificates are made redeemable in gold henceforth the silver dollar now legally the equal of the gold dollar as money of ultimate payment is to be only a token differing in no respect from the greenback it is to lose its character as redemption money and become itself redeemable in gold it is the intention of the authors of this bill to forever close the door against bimetallism in the united states a system denounced when not ignored by the platforms of all political parties from 1873 down to this hour is about to be forced upon the country and this crime blacker even than the infamy of 1873 is to be committed by the representatives of a party that has never avowed such a purpose but on the contrary stands solemnly pledged to a contrary policy in my state and in yours in 1896 the republicans contended that they and not the democrats were the true friends of bimetallism they declared that mr mckinley if elected would maintain the gold standard as the surest and in fact the only way of securing bimetallism and not with a view to its ultimate and irrevocable adoption i hazard nothing in saying that in all the region lying west of the alleghenies this was the position of the republicans in the only national campaign in which political parties have divided upon this question when grover cleveland began his crusade against silver republican orators in all parts of the country denounced him as an enemy of bimetallism i have no doubt that scores of gentlemen on the other side of the chamber delivered speeches denouncing his policy to cheering multitudes of republicans here is a sample of the republican oratory of that period it is an extract from a speech delivered by william mckinley at toledo ohio february 1891 during all of grover clevelands years at the head of the government he was dishonoring one of your precious metalsone of our own productsdiscrediting silver and enhancing the price of gold he endeavored even before his inauguration into office to stop the coinage of silver dollars and afterwards and to the end of his administration persistently used his power to that end he was determined to contract the circulating medium and to demonetize one of the coins of commerce limit the volume of money among the people make money scarce and therefore dear he would have increased the value of money and diminished the value of everything elsemoney the master everything else the servant he was not thinking of the poor then he had left their side he was not standing forth in their defense cheap coats cheap labor and dear money the sponsor and promoter of those professing to stand guard over the welfare of the poor and lowly was there ever more inconsistency or reckless assumption this speech was extensively used in 1896 to convince republicans that if elected the republican nominee would not sanction the policy of cleveland and follow in his footsteps but would labor steadfastly for the restoration of bimetallism mr mckinley was right the merciless bankers oligarchy back of this measure then and through whose influence it is now about to be made the law of the land are determined to demonetize one of the coins of commerce limit the volume of money among the people make money scarce and therefore dear they would increase the value of money and diminish the value of everything else they would make money the master everything else the servant when these bitter words were poured out upon the head of mr cleveland when thousands of republican orators were hurling similar verbal thunderbolts at the corpulent stuffed prophet who pointed out the path which is now leading them to dishonor who would have dared to predict that seven years after the philippic i have read was delivered mckinley as president and a republican congress would become the willing tools of the national bankers trust and force upon the statute book a law fastening upon tne country the policy they so fervently denounced it must not be supposed however that this law imposes the hardships of the gold standard upon all alike it exempts national banks from the necessity of keeping their reserves in gold and considerately loads the government with that responsibility section 3 of the bill provides for a gold reserve of 150 000 00 and in order to keep it intact authorizes the secretary of the treasury to sell bonds for its replenishment silver dollars silver certificates greenbacks and treasury notes are made sight drafts against this gold reserve which thus becomes the foundation upon which is to stand the vast pyramid of bredit represented by all forms of currency including nationalbank notes the banks may keep their reserves in treasury notes silver certificates or silver dollars the government their gratuitons agent redeems these notes on demand out of this redemption decemniber 12 fund thus if the exigencies of business necessitate gold exports or an opportunity to make profits by shipping gold out of the country arises all bullion dealers have to do is to appear at the treasury or at the subtreasury maintained for theii benefit in new york and present for redemption in gold treasury notes greenbacks silver certificates or silver dollars any old thing that happens to be in their vaultsand the gold will be forthcoming and if necessary they can convert nationalbank notes into sight drafts on the treasury payable in gold think of it gentlemen we are to have the gold standard but our bank reserves are to be kept in token money the existing law requires national banks to keep on depost in the treasury a 5 per cent redemption fund and when it is impaired they must make good the deficiency and the note holder has no cause of complaint for having received from one treasury official in redemption of a nationalbank note silver dollarshenceforth mere tokens or greenbackshe may step over to the adjacent wicket and exchange the tokens for gold we are to have the gold standard for the people gold is to measure the value of their property and be the harsh standard for the measurement of all debts but for the ultimate redemption of nationalbank notes the government isto maintain perpetually a gold reserve of 150 000 600 and in my opinion this is the most atrocious and indefensible feature of this miserable measure why only a short time ago the wise men who concocted this monstrosity were fully convinced that if somehow the endless chain could be broken the financial problem would be solved they said that the government was in the banking business that it was coinpelled to maintain a gold reserve with which to redeem the green backs that thenthe greenbacks had to be paid out again and so had to be redeemed over and over again and that as longas this system was adhered to the country might expect to suffer occasionally and for protracted periods afflictions such as came upon us in 1893 and continued until 1898 and what remedy did they propose why contraction and enlargement of the privileges of the national banks of course they demanded the retirement of the greenbacks and treasury notes and the abolishment of the gold reserve this they said worild takethe government out of the banking business for three years this was the programme urged upon the country by the gold monometallists and what has it all simmered down to a bill which adds to the greenbacks and treasury notes which formed the endless chain they have heretofore said ought to be abolished the silver dollars the silver certificates and as i have shown conclusively the nationalbanknotes itincreases the gold reserve to 150 000 000 makes it a permanent institution and in case of its impairment authorizes the secretary of the treasury to sell bonds for its replenishment and this bill is the offering of the same tinkers who aforetime declared that the salvation of the country depended upon abolishing the gold reserve and taking the government out of the banking business having stated briefly some of the benefits that will accrue to the national banks under this bill i will now give my views as to how it will affect the everyday business of the masses of the people the gentlemen on the other side of the chamberhave not discussed this phase of the subject theymake a great ado about thebusiness revival which through dispensations of providence and in spite of atrocious governmental policies came just in time to save the farmers shopkeepers mechanics andlaborers of this country from utter despair and seem to think that this will be taken as proof conclusive that this bill is precisely what the country needs it seems never to occurto them that a single turn of fortunes wheel may bring on adversity hard times may and unfortunately will come again experience has convinced the country that what it needs issuch a change in the banking laws as will prevent severe contraction of the volume of money when credit is withdrawn and only money will save thou sands from sinking from affluence to beggary periods of depression with creditors clamoring for payment with debtors eager to sell property at any price with gold flowing out of instead of intothe country call for enlargement instead of diminution in the volume of money will this bill furnish it laying aside for the moment differences of opinion as to the coinage law and keeping in view only features of the measure which relateto the paper currency we should be sure that this enactment will cure instead of breeding ipanics before giving it approval i am thoroughly convinced that it will operate to contractthe volume of money when money is most earnestly needed who ever heard of banks expanding note issues or any other form of credit during a panic i believe that the only cure for a stringency in the money market is more money and if this position be correct then this bill is about the worst that could have been devised under its provisions currency when redeemed in gold must remain under lock and key and the gold thus abstracted from the treasury will be sent out of the country nationalbank notes presented for redemption by the treasury raiders will be redeemed in gold or what amounts to the same thing in greenbacks or silver which can be forthwith exchanged for gold so that by this bill treasury raiding is simplified under existing statutes in order to raid the gold reserve bullion dealers have been compelled to obtain and present greenbacks or treasury notes under the pending measure this is unnecessary when gold is wanted for export any and every thing goes and if the gold reserve be trenched upon the secretary of the treasury must sell bonds and lay in a fresh supply the taxpayers have not forgotten what it cost the government to furnish to the bullion dealers of new york the large sums of gold sent abroad during 1893 1894 and 1895 in paymerit of heavy adverse balances of trade due to foreign creditors when by a conspiracy entered into by the president of the united states and his secretary of the treasury and the national bankers of new york the great panic of 189394 was improvised as an object lesson for the purpose of influencing legislation we had an illustration of what may be expected from the operation of this law there occurred a sudden and enormous contraction of available currency at a time when nothing but money would stay the ravages of the storm it was the work of the bankers syndicate forced liquidation compelled the sacrifice of property everywhere thousands offered to sell but for want of money few could buy the country banks did everything in their power to relieve the situation but the banks of the great metropolitan cities evenwhen willing to extend accommodations used their means to prop up the value of bonds and stocks while the commerce and trade of a continent was withering and dying for want of money exceedingly low prices were the inevitable consequence this dirinished the exchange value of our exports enormously and correspondingly increased the balance of trade against us gold was exported in increasing quantities under similar conditions do not gentlemen know this bill would fail utterly to meet the requirements of the country foreign governments discourage in every manner possible exports of specie the plan of the american gold monometallist is to make the treasury of the united states an auxiliary of the business they have done this in the past without authority or law this bill makes it a compulsory duty in 189394 the new york bankerswho make a specialty of exporting bullion reaped a goldenharvest at the expense of the american people theysolicited the business applied to the treasury for the necessary gold to meet their requirements and it was forthcoming in exchange for greenbacks which under the law couldhavebeen redeemed in silver and the only consequence would have been a premium on london exchange why right now the bank of france is protecting its gold reserve by recourse to the means i have here pointed out to have resortedto it in1893 and 1894 would have entailed slight hardship upon thesmallnumber ofpersons and corporations owing balances abroad but it would have mitigated the violence of a financial storm which brought ruin tothousands i know it is contended that the bullion dealersraided the gold reserve because they lacked confidence in the ability of the government to redeem its obligations iin gold but the truth is they were money merchants bullion dealers carrying onthe business because it is profitable they made enormous profits and thetaxpayers footed the bills all they had to do was to call on the federal treasury through the new yorkbanks for such sums as they desired and it was handed over it was shipped out of the country and next day the new york papers pointed to the transaction as evidence that confidence was lacking in the ability of the government to payits debts in gold thus ikelheimer made money and clevelands objectlesson was kept constantly before the country when the gold reserve became depleted to replenish it bonds were sold and the raiders went to work again my recollection is that two hundred and sixtytwo millions was thus added to the interestbearing debt and not the least infamous phase of this scandalous proceeding was that out of these bond deals the conspirators who brought on the panic made princely fortunes the bonds were sold at prices so low that even goldbug papers that justified their sale and defended the financial policy of the adnlinistration denounced the proceeding as infamous and in this connection i direct the attention of the gentlemenwho are about to make these bonds as well as all others payable in gold to some pertinent facts with which the people are entirely familiar with the exception of the 8262 000 000 issued during mr clevelands administration the government bonds outstanding are a legacy of the civil war they represent greenbacks worth in specie less than 50 cents on the dollar by the passageof the creditstrengthening act making them payable in coin their value was doubled by the passage of this act you are about to make the bondholders another present of probably 200 000 000 do gentlemen on the other side of the house demand proof in support of this statement it is found in the history of mr carlisles unsavory backroom bond deals mr cleveland strenuously urged the passage of a law conferring upon the secretary of the treasury authority to sell goldbearing bonds to replenish the gold reserve and as an argument in favor of the enactment of the measure cited the fact that the coterie of favorites who in those days thrived so splendidly on the profits of backroom deals with his secretary of the treasury would pay higher figures by which on an issue of 62 000 000 16 000 000 would be saved to the government if only the magic word gold could be written in the contract congress refused to comply with his request and the purchasers paid the lower price for bonds payable in coin and now gentlemen you propose to pass a bill which makes all government bondsthose representing greenbacks worth less than 50 cents on the dollar when the loan was made and the bonds issued by mr cleveland under the circunlstances i have detailedpayable in gold upon what theory do you justify this feature of the bill do you expect to satisfy your constituents by the use of lofty platitudes and resounding periods about sound money and the best money and dollars of equal value and the necessity of maintaining the parity do you expect to win your constituents approval of this act of reckless profligacy by lauding yourselves as guardians of the credit and honor of the country you are about to place in the hands of the secretary of the treasury power to issue gold bonds so that in case of its depletion he can replenish the gold reserve thus a single officer of the government is to have power to lay upon this and coming generations everincreasing burdens of taxation mr carlisle carried on the backroom bond deals which his countrymen have neither forgotten nor forgiven under a statute long regarded as obsolete a statute enacted for a particular purpose many years ago and which had not been thought of for twenty years now instead of repealing that law you are about to enact one vesting permanently in the secretary of the treasury a power which in the past has been shamefully abused and which henceforth may be resorted to whenever the friends of the administration see fit to raid the gold reserve and compel an issue of bonds to replenish it without unduly extending my remarks i can not discuss at greater length the details of this bill viewed in its entirety the measure is a clumsy effort to establish the english system of finance in the united states it establishes the gold standard but does not require the banks to redeem their notes in gold in england 170 banks of issue called there provincial banks may redeem their notes in bank of england notes and ultimate redemption is attained by presenting these bank of england notes for payment the 150 000 000 gold reserve and certain other treasury assets set apart as a redemption fund by this measure and by its provisions separated from other treasury assets finds its counterpart in the issue department of the bank of england which is in effect a department of the british government as well as a department of a private corporation the difference between the english system and the one here proposed is that there the burden of the ultimate redemption of the corporations promises to pay is thrown upon the bank while this bill imposes that duty upon the government at this time i will not undertake to trace the analogy further it runs all through the scheme except in this that unfortunately the very best feature of the english scheme of finance is not included ireland scotland wales and english cities outside of london have local banks of issue some of which havebeen in existence for more than a century the notes of these banks circulate almost exclusively in the neighborhoods where they are issued forming a strictly local medium of exchange and measurably relieving the interior of the destruction of values andbusiness occasioned by panics which have their originin the puts and calls of the gamblers of the london stock exchange the american people know by experience that nationalbank issues have not in the past and will not in the future serve this purpose i believe that the government should issue the paper currency of the country the constitution vests in this congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof and power to issue paper currency is no less an attribute of sovereignty than the power to coin money i but the republican majority in this house is determined to retire the governments paper issues and are about to enact a law giving to private corporations this supreme prerogative they seem to have attempted to adopt in its entirety a scheme of finance in vogue in a foreign country and lacking time to fully discuss this aspect of the question under consideration i can only call attention to the fact that conditions here render it impossible for this country to avail itself of the best features of the english system and now a few words as to the levity with which the gentlemen on the other side nearly every one of whom has confessed that he is a recent convert to clevelandism have insisted that the passage of this bill will forever dispose of the question which separated the political parties in 1896 let me warn the gentlemen who indulge in this illusion that never were they more mistaken the question yet to be determined is whether the american people sanction a policy conceived by the small number who are benefited by the gold standard and which has visited upon mankind more misery than all the wars and pestilences of recorded times you are about to pass a bill intended to perpetuate a system devised for the avowed purpose of cheapening property and increasing the value of money and think it will be acquiesced in it never will be at its inception the movement in favor of monometallism was based upon the preposterous notion that governments were under obligations to protect the value of money and fixed incomes by barring out of the mints the products of the gold mines of california and australia this was to make money the mastereverything else the servant the question at issue has not changed the passage of this bill will not change it increased production of the gold mines will not eliminate it gentlemen say that bimetallism is a dead issue that hence forth gold alone is to be the money of final payment that even though the wisdom of entirely demonetizing silver might have been doubtful at an earlier stage of the discussion the recent large increase in the production of the gold mines has solved the problem and therefore there will be general acquiescence in the action about to be taken by the lb ckinley administration before entering upon a discussion of this the crucial question i desire to state in precise terms the basis of the demand for the demonetization of one of the precious metals when and where it originated and the motive underlying it i believe that with a full understanding of indisputable historical facts there would be no division of opinion among the masses in this country concerning the matter a great many republican orators and writers have contended that the lpeople the world over grew tired of silver that they longed to get rid of it and that to gratify this desire it was demonetized by legislation in other words they ascribe the adoption of monometallism to evolution the survival of the fittest metal and insist that silver was discarded because the advanced civilization had reached conditions where it was no longer suitable for monetary purposes this argument if argument it can becalled has been madeplausible by the fact that in past ages iron leather shells and other gross substances were used as money and each in its turn abandoned on account of its unsuitableness to serve the purposes of more advanced civilization in order to demolish this subterfuge and makeshift it is only necessary to call attention to the fact that in the earlyfifties when first the agitation in favor of monometallism began in europe its advocates made war on gold and not on silver long before that period ricardo the great english economist had advanced the opinion that silver was more suitable for monetary purposes than gold and supported his contention with arguments of great weight probably the most forceful of which was that the susceptibility of silver to subdivision into coins of small value adapted it to the daily transactions of ninetenths of thepopulation and the fact that by its use loss by abrasion was onetwentiethof that entailed by the circulation of gold it would require a volume to even cursorily review the history of this controversy down to this the last act in the consummation of a scheme the sole purpose of which always has been and now is diminishment of the worlds supply of metallic money the demand for the demonetization of gold nearly fifty years ago was incited by the rise in prices resulting from a large increase in the production of the gold mines germany austria holland and i think portugal actually demonetized gold and in europe the fear that it was about to become worthless as a money metal became so general that astute shopkeepers drew trade to their houses by hanging out banners offering to take gold for goods a decline in gold production ensued and the agitation ceased but not until writers in france germany and england voicing the sentiment of the affluent classes of that period had published numerous books and pamphlets urging the demonetization of gold as a measure made necessary by the tendency to rising prices everywhere prevalent the agitation in favor of monometallism was renewed in 1867 this time it was the discovery of rich silver mines that alarmed the money lenders bondholders and others living on fixed incomes extravagant stories had been sent out as to the wonderful productiveness of the nevada mines numerous conferences ensued and finally at the paris conference of 1867 at which all favor this measurei desire tosay first that history mpjtions no the great european powers and the united states were represented instance in which a plethora of specie has injured a nahion but an explicit demand for the adoption of monometallism was pro history does mention a score of great empires that have passed mulgated like that made by chevalier the french economist away for the want of it nowhere in the annals of the race is it and his colaborers in germany and england fifteen years earlier said that at a particular period a deluge of the precious metals this demand rested upon a single proposition it was said that in worked injury to its advancement but great writers concur in asmuch as bondholders money lenders and others enjoying fixed saying that decreased productiveness of the mines brought on the incomes would be put to greater expense by an increase in the dark ages sir history abounds in reference to periods during price of living therefore the upward tendency of prices must be which civilization languished because of a dearth of gold and arrested silver at this point i invite especial attention to a fact which it seems such was the condition of the world when this continent was to me effectually disposes of the contention that its unsuitableness discovered and when spanish treasure ships laden with gold and for monetary purposes occasioned the demonetization of silver in silver from the mines of peru and mexico poured into the chanthe published proceedings of the paris conference will be found nels of trade in europe a fresh supply of specie without which the report of a committee setting forth the grounds upon which there would have been a return of the dark ages an era of progthe demand for the adoption of monometallism was made lan ressand advancement began such was the condition of the world guage could not be plainer than was there employed fifty years ago when on account of diminished production of it is easy to see that the real value of the metals has diminished it is dif gold and silver in mexico and south america the stock of meficult to estimate exactly what the diminution is but whatever it may be tallic money b~came so far depleted that throughout the world it demands the attention of governments because it affects unfavorably all commerce was carried on largely by barter again new life was that portion of the population whose income remaining nominally the same undergoes a yearly diminution of purchasing power as governments cn imparted to civilization by rich discoveries in california an austrol the weight and standard of money they ought so far as possible to as tralia and again the world resumed its onward and upward march sure its value and as it is admitted that the tendency of the metals is to on this continent most notably but in a large degree in the redepreciate this tendency should be arrested by demonetizing one of them motest corners of

this century has far outrun the increase in the product of the mines it seems to have been reserved for this century to apply all that man had learned before to peaceful pursuits and to experience a realization of every hope indulged by the centuries of the past in all european countries there has been an enormous increase in the volume of exchanges domesti6 and foreign during this century there has been a large increase in the area of civilized states cities have sprung up surrounded by densely populated communities in regions which fifty years ago had not been explored it requires a larger sum of money to operate the worlds railroads now than it did to pay all the expenses of all the governments in the world one hundred years ago the daily expenses of the newspapers and printing houses in christendom now exceed the pay roll of the factories of the world a hundred years ago the great state of new york contains a larger population than inhabited this continent a hundred years ago the foreign commerce including imports and exports of the united states this year has exceeded the foreign commerce of all the nations combined a hundred years ago the inspiration of modern industrial development has spread to the orient and the sleeping millions referred to by the great napoleon as factors in the worlds affairs that were dormant but not dead have awakened from the slumber of ages industrial and commercial development is going on by leaps and bounds not in the united states alone but in every corner of the world and before i conclude my remarks i think i will be able to demonstrate that no matter what the output of the mines it is not and never will be sufficient even partially to meet the demand for metallic money why mr chairman stronger arguments for the doctrines contended for by bimetallists have never been made than have fallen from the lips of gentlemen on the other side of the chamber who have spoken in favor of this bill they have said over and over again that the revival in business which has recently taken place was attributable to an increased stock of the precious metals they have attributed rising prices to an increase in the per capita circulation they have pointed to the enormous quantity of gold brought to this country by the favorable balance of trade to increased issues of paper currency and the coinage of several millions of silver as blessings of incomputible value the gentleman from indiana presented and has printed in the record elaborate tables and voluminous statistics all going to show a considerable increase in the volume of money and he and other republican orators who followed him agree that renewed business activity rising prices increased production and vast additions to the wealth of the country have resulted could recognition of the quantitative theory of money be more complete and yet in 1896 you said we had plenty of money and denied that more would restore prosperity it seems to me that in trying to make a very strong case in favor of a bill that fastens gold monometallism upon the country the gentlemen have taken a position absolutely fatal to the theory on which the measure rests they have laid much stress upon the large increase in our export trade and with the native modesty of orthodox republican statesmanship have taken unto themselves and their party full credit therefor what may i ask have the p eliticians had to do with bringing about the more favorable business conditions now prevailing did republican stump speeches cause for three consecutive years beginning with 1896 crop failures in india russia the balkan states and austriahungary our rivals in the production of wheat thereby giving us a monopoly of european markets at prices made higher by abnormal scarcity this not republican speeches is what gave us a large favorable balance of trade and brought about accidental replenishment of our stock of metallic money without which prosperity would have been impossible by pointing to large imports of gold and consequent better times the repub icans admit that what we needed in 1896 was not confidence but more money it came to us not as a result of anything done by the politicians or national bankers but in payment for the products of the farms of the mississippi valley missouri kansas and nebraskathree states that cast their electoral votes for bryan and bimetallismhad more to do with restoring prosperity than all new england with new york thrown in for good count before entering upon an examination of the elaborate tables and voluminous statistics cited by the gentleman from indiana i desire to call attention to some wellknown economic facts the first and most important is that according to the very best authorities fully threefourths of the gold produced by the mines is absorbed by the arts or carried to oriental countries from whence it never returns now i know there is a disposition to brush this statement aside as incredible but facts coming constantly under our own observation as well as the history of the race prove its correctness gentlemen may say that this might have been true when the mines were producing a much smaller quantity than now but that south africa the klondike and cripple creek are so deluging the world with gold that now no such a thing is possible i think it is only necessary to casually examine this assumption to prove its incorrectness other factors besides the extent of the production of the mines enter into the problem it is in periods of depression that the largest additions are made to the volume of metallic money in hard times economy is practiced by a large proportion of the population protracted periods of commercial paralysis compel a great many to forego the luxuries the first pinch of hard times cuts down expenditures for things that can be dispensed with and as long as hard times continue economy is practiced during such a period the encroachment of the arts upon the stock of precious metals is at the minimum under such circumstances out of a relatively small output of the mines the money supply would be considerably increased the converse of this proposition is true general prosperity enables a large proportion of the population to gratify the whims of fashion or cravings inspired by love of the beautiful and unattainable it results that at the zenith of a prosperous era the consumption of gold is at the maximum and with large production the increase in metallic money is small and i think thatright here is found an explanation of what otherwise would be a mystery we are told that gold and silver are durable metdls and that since their preciousness is a motive for their preservation from destruction the aggregate stock is being constantly increased where then are the vast treasures that have been wrung from the mines by the toil and sacrifice of all the generations that have preceded us to my mind the answer to this question seems very simple as you walk down pennsylvania avenue keep your eye on the shopkeepers windows and then bear in mind that the display of jewelry and works of art wrought in gold and silver there seen are duplicated in every city in christendom in the palaces of the rich and in the hovels of the poor you may find an answer to this question which i think effectually disposes of the arguments made in support of this measure the sfatistics presented by the gentleman from indiana clearly prove tliat notwithstanding the large increase in the production of the gold mines mentioned by him so boastfully the addition to the worlds stock of coined money has not relieved the strain felt by the financial world in recent years nor ameliorated the intensity of the struggle which constantly for years has menaced the prosperity of nations and the fortunes of individuals the gentleman from indiana presents a table showing the production of gold from 1862 to 1898 inclusive according to this table the world produced during this period gold of the value of 5 082 935 800 mulhall gives the aggregate stock of gold money in the world in 1898 at 4 594 900 0u0 adding 150 000 000 as a liberal estimate of the sum of subsequent additions to that amount we have 4 744 900 000 as the aggregate stock of gold money now in the world do these figures not plainly prove that there is now in use in the world as money a great deal less than the product of this century do they not in fact prove that the worlds stock of gold money is at this time barely equal to the product of the mines during the past thirtyfive years they certainly do prove that gentlemen who have persuaded themselves that gold production has grown so large as to effectually settle the money question have reached that conclusion without investiuation or reflection and that some of the orators of the other sidewho have sneered at bimetallism as a dead issue may be pardoned on account of their want of information on this subject but in other respects the statistics presented by the gentleman from indiana are absolutely conclusive on this point according to the table showing the production of gold in recent years the mines produced during the past ten years in round numbers 1 785 000 000 in gold statisticians say that this years product will amount to over 300 000 000 let us place it at that sum this added to the product of the past ten years as shown by the table brought here by the gentleman from indiana makes the aggregate product since 1888 2 085 000 000 this is a very large amount of gold and if we accept the tableo as accurate and i know they are drawn from the most reliable sources within our reach it is equal to twothirds of all the gold money in the world in 1873 but i assert and shall undertake to demonstrate that studied in the light of current history these figures instead ofproving that it is safe to rely upon the gold supply for a supply of metallic money prove precisely the contrary i have called attention to the product of the mines during the past ten years for the purpose of inquiring of gentlemen on the other side of the house what has become of it it is true that recently our imports of gold have largely exceeded our exports but it is also true that during the tenyear period referred to we sent abroad nearly a hundred million more gold than we imported why is it then thatwhen the united states reclaimed less than two hundred and eighty million of the three hundred and sixtyfour million sent abroad during the past ten years all european capitals experienced the shock vhen the gold went abroad we were engulfed in ruin the gold recently imported into this country came to us in the ordinary course of trade and when it came to us a wail was heard in every countingroom in london berlin paris and st petersburg to prevent gold exports the imperial bank of germany advanced interest rates to 7 per cent so did the bank of england and france took similar measures to prevent gold leaving that country for three months or more the european papers have been discussing with alarm the prospects of further losses of gold what then becomes of the pretense that enormous production has settled the question if increased production has not relieved the situation what may we expect when production declines when the south african war broke out the london papers reflecting the views of english bankers indulged in gloomy forebodings as to the effect the loss of the product of the transvaal mines would have upon the money market and this notwithstanding the fact that over 2 000 000 000 has been produced by the mines since 1888 again i inquire where has it gone what has become of it while nominally all european countries have adopted the gold standard russia austria italy and spain use depreciated paper gold measures their debts but the money of commerce used by their people is paper austria has been on a paper basis ever since the napoleonic wars with no prospect of returning to the use of specie as long as the gold standard holds sway this observation applies also to italy and spain where paper has been the money of commerce for a considerable period and is likely to remain so indefinitely russia has the largest gold reserve in the world but ever since the crimean war depreciated paper has been the sole circulating medium in that country a year ago the great empire began the redemption and retirement of paper with a view to the resumption of specie payment and thereby became subject to the evils which for a generation have afflicted every nation in which the gold standard prevails 1 thus refer to the status of monetary affairs in european countries for the purpose of directing attention to the fact that whatever advantages have grown out of the enormous production of gold so frequently referred to in this discussion have accrued to the five leading goldstandard countriesthe united states france germany great britain and russia has the gold produced by the mines in recent years gone into the monetary circulation of these countries go read their newspapers for an answer read the foreign telegrams that appear day after day in the american newspapers and learn that all europe is threatened with a gold famine when recently the secretary of the treasury bought twenty millions of the government bonds in order to relieve the new york money market the london papers expressed thankfulness for the timely intervention and congratulated the capitalists upon the fact that this would relieve the stringency in new york and prevent our drawing large balances which stand to our credit in london banking houses and added that this would at least temporarily relieve the pressure in london but that at berlin pronounced stringency existed and that no means for the relief of germany were in sight since then it has transpired that the action of our treasury department has enabled new york to go to londons relief large shipments of gold are going from new york to the english capital and our bankers are adding to their large english balances notwithstanding the stringency at home and the fact that they could tomorrow draw on london for many millions they are exporting gold by the million to prop up the gold standard there the gen~tlemen on the other side of the chamber look upon this great question from the standpoint from which europe viewed it six or seven years ago then the balance of trade was against us and in payment we were compelled to send large quantities of gold to europe the result was great stringency recently the balance of trade has been against europe and part of our gold has come back to us and europe is threatened with a financial collapse i direct attention to current events for the purpose of again inquiring what has become of the deluge of gold that has poured out of the mines during the last ten or twelve years i declare that it has not placed even the strongest money powers in the world on a strong financial basis we contended in 1896 that there was not enough gold in the world to furnish the great commercial powers with a sufficient stock of specie everything that has transpired since then has proven the correctness of that position in conclusion i desire to state broadly what i conceive to be the real problem involved when first the bondholders and kindred classes demanded the demonetization of one or the other of the precious metals in order to make money scarce the fixed debts of the world represented a comparatively small sum i have seen in print the statement that at the end of the napoleonic wars the worlds fixed debts and dividendbearing stocks in quasipublic corporations combined did not exceed twenty billions it is probable that by 1850 the amount had doubled and recent estimates place it at from one hundred and fifty to two hundred billions including state municipal corporate and individual debts secured by mortgages doubtless the aggregate is at least one hundred and fifty billions placing the earning power of this enormous sum at 4 per cent per annum it exacts in dividends and interest every year the enormous sum of 6 000 000 000 under existing conditions a large portion of the six billionsat least twothirds of it and probably moreis added to the principal and so the world sinks eeper and deeper into the bondage of debt every year the total sum of fixed charges becomes greater the enactment of this bill is another step in the direction of compelling the world to go on compounding the interest on fixed debts thereby fastening perpetually upon theworld the grasp of the money power gentlemen usury is devouring the world everywhere the usurer is omnipotent i firmly believe there is not in the world a single government that is not absolutely controlled by financial syndicates corporations and millionaire bankers in this free republic they have seized control of first one political party and then another in order to work out their evil purposes they elect our presidents in many cases name the judges of our courts and in every state in the union employ the professional lobbyist to superintend politics manipulate conventions and control public policies they seduce the weak buy the vicious and by means of political enginery that only money will buy strike down and destroy whoever is bold enough to dispute their sway centralized wealth is a menace to human liberty in every part of the globe in these latter days it has achieved many victories beneficial to the few and oppressive to the many it has made kings presidents legislatures and courts the instrumentalities by which it is rapidly absorbing the wealth of christendom grievous have been the sins of truculent rulers and public officials who have yielded to its blandishments but of all the infamies ever perpetrated for its benefit the step about to be taken by this congress is the most infamous sir the impartial future historian will not fail to brand with dishonor the political party that is about to commit this crime by the passage of this bill the scheme devised by the bondholders and capitalists of europe fifty years ago receives the approval of the republican party it never has received the approval of the american people and it never will today you gloat over this victory achieved by the flagrant violation of the confidence of the people but a day of reckoning will come be sure thy sin shall find thee out throughout this discussion gentlemen have mentioned boastfully the general revival of business and industry throughout the country the inference being that the country is indebted to republican stump speakers for better times my friends prosperity is not the creation of politicians the men who toil and not the men who talk perform the labor and produce the wealth that blesses mankind to the miner who plies his weary task unblessed by the sunlight to the sailor who braves the dangers of the deep to the pioneer who fells the forest to the husbandman plowing in the field to the artisan to whose skilled hands we are indebted for every comfort that blesses our homes to gods creatures of the humbler sort the country is indebted for renewed prosperity if the eloquent gentlemen vho have so immoderately praised themselves and their party as the authors of prosperity will look about them without difficulty they may learn the cause of better times the source of prosperity is told by the myriad voices of busy industry the thunder of the locomotive the whir of factory wheels the song of the husbandman as he plows his field tell us whence it comes to those who toil and are content if so be it that poor privilege be given them be awarded all the glory which republican orators would take unto themselves blessed be they the fruition of whose devotion is read in the sheen of golden harvests and seen in the product of field forest factory mine and shop"], [0.02108687162399292, 0.9789131283760071, 1, "the constitutional questions presented by the pending bill have been so ably discussed that i shall pass by that with the statement that i fully agree with the minority of the committee the questions that i do desire to discuss briefly are so interwoven so dependent one upon the other that i find it difficult to discuss them independently they are imperialism and standing armies the first is the fruit of greed and love of power and the last a large standing army is the result of the fear of popular government by those who would wrong the people there has been much able discussion in this house and throughout the country on the subject of imperialism and there has been much confusion over the terms expansion and imperialism in fact they have generally been used as if bearing the same meaning the extension of the territory of a country which territory is adjacent thereto or sufficiently close and adapted or suitable to become a part of the government to be molded into states to be governed under the uniform constitution and laws of the country would be expansion the taking of a nation of people and their country by purchase from another nation which has no moral right to sell or by conquest which on account of its location and character of its people could not in the nature of things become a part of the government for the purpose of enforcing a government upon them without their consent is imperialism the one is american and does not violate the fundamental principles of our government and presents itself more as a question of expediency than otherwise each proposition depending upon its own merits the other belongs exclusively to empires and monarchies and is contrary to all the history and principles of our country and does not find support in the teachings of any of the great men who established this government for the benefit of mankind therefore in this discussion i shall confine myself to the philippine question and shallnot confuse the question of expansion or natural growth with the question of imperialism and force much effort is being put forth to show thatin the purpose of the administration to hold and govern the people of the philipipine islands they are but executing the teachings of jefferson jackson and the great democrats of the past nothing to my mind is farther from the truth of history nowhere in history can you find a declaration of these great statesmen patriots and democrats or any of them advocating the taking by conquest or purchase a nation of people on the eastern lemisphere and governing them by force after the manner of the kingdoms of europe as dependencies and the man who makes the claim is either misinformed as to the history of his own country or confuses the truth of the past with the false issues of the present so as to divert the public mind from the real question and real danger we hear much said by the advocates of imperialism about the louisiana purchase and the various acquisitions of territory by the united states in the past but what analogy can there be between these acquisitions to become a part of the united states practically contiguous territory and the acquisition of a foreign country in the eastern hemisphere and more than 8 000 miles from our shores with 9 000 000 people not intended to ever become a part of one homogeneous government under the same constitution and laws but to be subjects and vassals there is no more analogy in my judgment between the two propositions than there is between right and wrong between liberty and serfdom between a republic and an imperial monarchy the great louisiana purchase made in 1803 was a legitimate desirable and necessary acquisition to our country and was acquired under the direction of the great democrats of that day the third article of the treaty for the cession of this vast territory contained the following language the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the union of the united states and admitted as soon aspossible according to the principles of the federal constitution to the enjoyment of all the rights advantages and immunities of the citizens of the united states and in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty property and the religion which they profess also the treaties ceding to the united states florida california new mexico and utah contained similar provisions thesetreaty stipulations embodied the wise and patriotic thought of the immortals of the democratic party of that day they taught expansion and legitimate growth within constitutional limitations listen to the language of the treaty the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the union of the united states and admitted as soon as possible according to the principles of the federal constitution to the enjoyment of all the rights etc the purposes and the hopes of the wise men who were instrumental in securing these splendid additions to our country were to build up and establish a great and powerful compact nation of libertyloving people who would be able to defy and defeat the combined armies of the kingdoms of the world but the imperialist with a great manifestation of pride asks us what will we do with the territories acquired from spain under the treaty of peace my answer is that there is a policy distinctly american that can and ought to be pursued it is not a new or dangerous policy it has been tried in the past and that test bears the highest evidence of the wisdom and justice of the policy at the end of the war between this country and mexico in 1848 mexico was reduced to a state of almost anarchy what did this country do bolstered up a newly organized government until a treaty was made then withdrew from the territory and left the government in the hands of the people revolution after revolution followed in quick succession but we did not feel called upon to place them uncder the tutelage of this government and send our armies and force a government upon the people without their consent and now we can look with pride at the happiness and progress of the people of mexico with a stable and just government keeping step with the progressive nations of the world they were at our doors we subjugated them by the power of our armies but we did not make them dependent subjects of this government under the pretext that it was necessary to maintain our international obligations or in obedience to manifest destiny but we told them to organize and maintain their own free and independent government and enjoy the blessings of a government based upon the will of their own people we said to the imperial crowns of europe hands off let them work out their own destiny this course is and has been the manifest destiny of this government and if pursued in the future will add new glory and honor to the republic and strengthen the cause of human liberty throughout the world this was the democratic way that the republican administration would abandon when did we get this notion of governing foreign nations of people and of maintaining the peace in the orient how old is it with us some little examination of that question might be profitable at this time take haiti lying just beyond cuba where there have beenmany revolutions and much internal strife we have not interfered nor allowed any other nation to interfere they are much nearer to us than the philippines they are a part of the western hemisphere how is it with venezuela she has had many revolutions no longer than 1895 england under the pretext of a boundary dispute concluded to extend the blessings of english imperialism over a portion of that country what did the united states do they asserted the principles of the monroe doctrine over that country and compelled england to abandon her purpose or accept the alternative of a war with this country which she wisely declined this country then left venezuela to work out its own destiny this action on the part of our government met with almost the universal approval of our people this policy was then regarded in the light of farseeing statesmanship and as the outgrowth of an exalted and unselfish patriotism but now it is said the course we pursued toward mexico haiti and venezuela if followed as to the territory in the orient surrendered by spain would be monstrous and disgrace the nation in the eyes of the civilized nations of the world why such a radical change in ourpolicy what has happened to demand of us that we should abandon these high purposes of our government the one great distinctive feature that distinguishes our republic from the kingdoms of europe is this policy what gave birth to this new american idea that is scarcely twelve months old who is it that would have announced the present teachings of the imperialists two years ago who is it that would have announced these unamerian doctrines in the halls of congress even one year ago not one among all the representatives of the people here there is a cause for this rapid change and that cause in my opinion is not altogether what has happened or is happening in the philippine country but what has happened there has furnished the opportunity for certain forces and elements in this country to develop themselves and they have adopted the misleading terms of expansion manifest destiny and national duty 1 to cloak from public view the purpose to overthrow the principles of safety and liberty and destroy the love and veneration of our people for the constitution and the immortal declaration of independence now this brings us down to one of two propositions that we must accept if we determine to exercise permanent sovereignty over the philippine islands first that they thereby become citizens of the united states and are filipinoamericans endowed with the rights and privileges of an american citizen to go and come to this country as often as they may desire this i believe will be their status under our constitution and the present decision of our supreme court if carried out chief justice fuller in boyd vs thayer 143 u s says manifestly the nationality of the inhabitants of territory acquired by conquest or cession becomes that of the government under whose dominion they rass subject to the right of election on their part to retain their former nalionality by removal or otherwise as may be provided second if they do not in fact become a part of the united states by the exercise of sovereignty over them under the treaty they must be treated as subjects and governed after the order of monarchies by this government this i do not believe can be done under our form of government without violating the fundamental principles of the law of the land and overthrowing the uniform line of decisions of the supreme court since its earliest history if there existed no constitutional restrictions to prevent us from pursuing either of these policies i would still oppose them both to admit them as citizens and a part of this government would be disastrous to our people in many ways upon the present basis of representation in congress it would entitle them when they become a state to 53 members of this body to say nothing of the number of senators to which they would be entitled which would enable them to decide almost every disputed question in congress and to determine every closely contested election they would as citizens have the right of ingress and egress the same as any other citizen of the republic their halfclad hordes their cheap labor could come here in such numbers as to endanger the pursuits of our laboring people in their struggles for the comforts of life for themselves and their families but this is useless talk the american people will never consent to this and no man dare advocate it no star will ever be added to our flag representing an asiatic race this proposition being out of the way we are compelled to hold them as vassals and subjects to be governed by us by force or else we must liberate them upon such terms as will be fair to the united states and just to them and if this government undertakes to pursue the course of domination and subjugation followed by the european powers it will be in total disregard of the policies heretofore pursued by this nation and in violation or its constitution and laws it will be in effect an abandonment of the monroe doctrine and will be a complete revolution of our own government those who advocate this english colonial policy are forced to deny the most venerated principles of the declaration of independence and many of them openly and boldly challenge and dispute them they deride and challenge the wisdom of the political fathers who consecrated their lives their property and their sacred honors upon the altar of free government they would change the glorious history of the past and convict the revolutionary fathers of a mistake in resisting the oppression of great britain by now openly applying the same principles to a nation of 9 000 000 people in a foreign country that great britain undertook by her armies to enforce upon the colonies in america when they were scarcely 3 000 000 strong if this is not imperialism what is it the advocates of this doctrine squirm under the name imperialism and say they are expansionists if they are england and every other european country are expansionists upon exactly the same principles england germany russia france all hold and govern their colonies by force and if we by our military power undertake to permanently hold and govern the philippine people without their consent what differentiates those governments from ours if it is imperialism for them it is likewise imperialism for us if it is oppression and tyranny in them to govern other nations of people by force it is no less a crime for our own country to do the same thing before we can successfully put on the old clothes of the monarchies of the world made threadbare by the wear of centuries and direct the future of our government in the bloody pathway of cruelty and oppression pursued by them we must revolutionize our own government and repudiate its glorious history we must tear down the bulwarks of the constitution and repudiate the declaration of independence for whenever its sacred principles are read and learned by the governed colonies it will inspire in the hearts of the people the hope of liberty and teach them that it is a godgiven right to throw off the yoke of a foreign government that seeks to govern them without their consent fapplause it is an open concession that england was right in her effort to govern our ancestors in the days of the revolution in the discussion of this question it is claimed by the friends of imperialism that the permanent retention and control of the philippines is essential to the extension of our foreign trade and to my mind no argument made on this subject has less of real merit in it than this one they point with confidence to the fact that our export trade has greatly increased in the last year and would have this house and the country believe that our trade had increased in proportion to the destruction of our men in the philippines we have had no trade with the archipelago during this great increase in our foreign trade the ports in these islands have been under blockade during the whole time our trade has been entirely in the markets of the world that have been open to us for years and years and has not been favorably affected by our conflict in the philippines the opendoor policy in china which has been the case for years is now paraded as one of the natural results following from the acquisition of these islands forgetting that if we continue to control the islands we too must adopt the opendoor policy considering for a moment the question as to the dollars and cents in it it is a vastly losing bargain the entire imports of the islands in 1894 which were the largest in recent times amounted to only 23 558 552 if the importers realized a net profit of 20 per cent that would leave the entire profits at less than 5 000 000 if it should be increased tenfold the profits would onlybe about fortyfive millions we now have in these islands 65 000 men and officers it is estimated by the best military authority that the cost of maintaining an army in a foreign country will amount to 1 500 per man for a year at this rate our army in the philippines is costing us 97 500 000 a year so you see upon the basis of 1894 it would take the import trade twenty years to pay us for our expense during the year 1899 but in addition to oar army we are supporting there a vast naval squadron amounting to at least 25 000 000 a year making all told an annual expense of more than 120 000 000 but some will say that when you have subjugated the people you can withdraw your army notso the history of the world shows beyond doubt that there never has been an instance where the white race have held in subjection an asiatic race that it did not require a great army of occupation to do so and i believe the longer we pursue our mistaken policy the greater will be the loss and disaster to us but this is not all i can see in this policy dangers to the people of the south more appalling to me than the expenditure of a few million dollarsdangers that i believe will paralyze her progress and imperil her great agricultural interests i find sir in the report of majorgeneral green of the army 21 55 of the united states made in august 1898 the statement that cotton was formerly produced there in large quantities we find from an examination of the statement of the treasury department issued in 1899 entitled summary of commerce and finance that as far back as 1818 these islands exported not only homespun cotton fabrics but that they exported in one year 25 000 worth of longstaple cotton we also find that in that country there is a native tree that is known as the cotton tree which yields a coarse fiber resembling our cotton now these natural conditions so favorable to the production of cotton and so much so that the cotton tree grows without cultivationwho can predict to what extend these islands may add to the cotton stock of the world already the longstaple cotton from egypt has been coming in competition with our own cotton to such an extent that many southern planters have been asking for a protective tariff for several years this competition has greatly reduced the price of the long staple this year the price of this cotton took a sharp advance owing to the short crop in egypt and yet some people seem to believe that this increase was caused by the war in the philippines i find in this same report the following statement which i will quote longstaple cotton was formerly extensively cultivated in the province of llocos norte whence many years ago large quantities of good cotton stuffs were exported this industry still exists the cultivation of this staple was however discouraged by the local governors in order to urge the planting of tobacco for the government supplies the cultivation of cotton was discouraged by spain and almost prohibited in the islands in the interest of the tobacco monopoly from which the government could extort greater revenues ialso find that the coprah oil is produced in these islands from the cocoanutpalm nuts and that 53 750 tons of this oil was produced there in 1897 this oil is used for every purpose that the cottonseed oil of the south can be used for and may prove to be a dangerous competitor there are in these islands about 9 000 000 people of these about 6 000 000 are of the catholic faith and the remainder are heathens mohammedans and chinese the price of labor in that country will average from 2 to 3 per month and being in near touch with china her hordes may be turned into that country by the adventurers who will dominate the people there if we maintain permanent sovereignty over the islands under the treaty of paris in the story of the philippines written by mr fiske this statement occurs at page 66 the longstaple cotton could be easily cultivated and at one time there were cotton fields in northern luzon it only needs enterprise and common sense to make cotton raising a valuable industry now with this acknowledged natural condition in that country with its pauper labor capable of producing cotton and cotton goods in such quantities as to absolutely threaten this great industry in our own country is it wise in us to force conditions there that will build up this competition against our own farmers and manufactories i think not today the south in its development in manufacturing cotton goods is not only surprising her own people but has startled new england and she is warned that she must soon go out of business unless this rapid development of the factories of the south is handicapped in some way the east can not compete with the south where cotton fuel and labor can be had at the very doors of the factories many of these new england factories are going south many more of them that have collected tribute from our people for a quarter of a ceitury under the tariff system and have grown rich from the unreasonable bounty collected from our people are not willing to give up these splendid privileges without a struggle and i have all along been surprised that the republican representatives from the eastern states and their senators with them save two stood solid for a policy that they claimed would be of such a great advantage to the great cottongrowing south the contest between the manufacturing sections of the country north and east and the great producing south has not always fallen on patriotic and unselfish lines for years and years the south has paid the tariff taxes and the other sections of the country have gathered the profits into their own pockets and i do not suspect that they will look at the commercial side of the philippine question from a wholly unselfish standpoint the keen eyes of the trusts and corporations that have grown rich and arrogant from the benefits given them by class legislation see in the philippines vast opportunities if they can only induce the people under the leadership of president mckinley mark hanna steve elkins co to adopt the policy of imperialism which would require a vast army to be kept there to dominate the people while the trusts and corporations exploit the country the new england factories could be transferred there and cotton could be raised and manufactured by the pauper laborers of that country costing from 5 to 10 cents a day with a few bosses and experts to direct it and their products could enter the markets of asia and china at prices that would absolutely destroy our trade they could by utilizing that vast army of pauper laborers grow cotton and ship it to the united states far below the cost of production here and i firmly believe that it is this great promise that excites the cupidity and avarice of the great corporations and trusts in this country whose power is driving the present administration madly and blindly on to the disastrous policy of imperialism and oppression what would be the difference to our people whether we send our armies to the orient to guard the factories and protect these heartless syndicates at public expense while they dominate and speculate upon the people there and utilize their lands and cheap labor to destroy our foreign markets or permit this pauper labor to come here and drive our farmers from their farms and our mechanics and laboring people from the factories and shops either would be equally criminal in us we have prohibited the importation of pauper contract labor by law and i protest that we shall not now adopt a policy that will permit our capitalists to go to the philippines under the protection of our flag and build up a competition that will destroyour foreign markets such a policy would be a greivous crime against the army of burden bearers in this country the farmers and aborers of our country it seems under the wisdom of modern statesmanship as evidenced by the policies of the republican party are not only to be required to bear the great burdens of taxation without promise of relief and to submit to the extortions of trusts and combines at home without let or hindrance but are to be called upon to pay the expenses of vast armies to support the imperial policies of the president while other nations are to be plundered by adventurers but must see our own markets destroyed and our peace endangered and the perpetuity of our institutions threatened if not destroyed and yet those who underrate the intelligence and patriotism of the farmers laborers and legitimate and intelligent business men of the country flatter themselves that they can induce them to aid in their own destruction under the plea of manifest destiny you and your party deceive yourselves you do not know and appreciate the intelligence of our people they are not only intelligent and industrious but they understand to a remarkable degree the practical political questions of the hour they are acquainted with the matchless history of our government they love our institutions they stand ready to offer any sacrifice to perpetuate our institutions but no eloquence can persuade them and no power can compel them to abandon the wellknown principles and policies of our government and to acceptthe imperial policies of european nations the war in the philippine islands is a useless war for which the president and those under his control are responsible i believe after the most careful consideration that the alternative was forced upon the filipino people to fight or consent to become the permanent colonial subjects of the united states if that is not true the war was the result of the most masterly stupidity that ever marked the disgrace of a public officer there has never been a day from the beginning of this war that it could not havb been stopped upon terms not only just to the united states but with national honor our government said to mexico we will aid you to establish your government and when proper and just treaty agreements are entered into we will withdraw our armies and leave your government to your own people the filipinos are better equipped for selfgovernment than the mexicans were at that time they aided us in driving spain from the island of luzon they fought bravely and killed and captured more than 15 0030 spaniards yet our wise and benevolent president says to them surrender unconditionally and then we will tell you what we are going to do when they have at all times stood ready to lay down their arms upon an assurance of national independence upon such terms as the united states should suggest but still the cruel war goes on how easy how just how honorable it would be for the united states to say to these people struggling for national independence lay down your arms we will aid you to establish a government which shall be yours when established as soon as you shall by treaty stipulations agree to indemnify the united states for the amount paid spain an~d make such trade agreements as shall be deemed wise touching our trade relations reserving to ourselves if need he such harbors naval and military stations as may be necessary to aid our commerce and then say to the nations of the world as we did in the case of mexico let them alone while they work out their own salvation there has not been an hour since the treaty of paris was signed that the philippine people would not cheerfully accept these honorable conditions the treaty of peace with spain was signed at paris december 10 1898 more than a year ago and no war has been declared against any other nation by congress and yet we find the appropriations asked for the army and navy for the next fiscal year are enormous the estimates for the navy will reach 65 000 000 and for the army the enormous sum of 111 700 364 making a grand total of 176 700 364 estimating our population at 75 000 000 this will amount to a tax of a little more than 2 35 upon the head of every man woman and child in the united states or a tax of over 12 25 upon every family of five persons in the united states and the amount for last year is even greater than this but admit it is the same then for the two years of imperialism in the philippines it will cost an amount equal to a tax of 25 upon every family of five in the united states this sum may look small to you and your party leaders but it is an enormous tax upon the man who must support his wife and children by his daily labor either in the shop or upon his little farm when a man is compelled to use the greatest industry and strictest economy to make ends meet and then you put an extra tax upon him of 25 or 50 it means much to him it means that not only he but the wife and children for whom he labors so hard must want for the comforts of life and yet he gets no relief the poet miss landon has beautifully and truthfully said few save the poor feel for the poor the rich know not how hard it is to be of needful rest and of needful food debarred they know not of the scanty meal with small pale faces round no fire upon the cold damp hearth when snow is on the ground but this is not all that this unwarranted policy costs us every man that is wounded and the widow and children of those who are killed in battle or die from disease also those who become diseased from the service become pensioners upon the government and out of an army of 65 000 men in the philippines it is a low estimate to say that they will furnish a pension roll of 20 000 persons annually to say nothing of the senseless sacrifice of brave american soldiers worthy to die in a nobler and grander cause but the good soldier must obey orders it is not his privilege to question the right or wrong of a war it is his to do and to die great has been the sacrifice already how long will the administration pursue this blunder transports are arriving almost weekly laden with the sick insane and dead as the fruits of this policy i speak not alone for the filipino i plead sot so much for his home and country but iplead for american omes i plead for the brave boys that from a sense of duty to the commander in chief of our army who are called upon to make this useless sacrifice it is my own country that i would save from the fatal policy of empire and greed and lust of power we should profit not only from our own experience within the last year but by the present experiences of great britain today the little dutch colonies of south africa are holding at bay her embattled legions the two little republics in south africa with a total population of only 150 000 people are challenging the power of england and shaking her empire to its center already her list of casualties amount to more than 10 000 men and her supremacy is threatened by other powers and a conflict now with any of the other great nations would end in the overthrow of english power these brave people in their struggle for liberty by their bravery and courage have the admiration and deserve the sympathy of libertyloving people everywhere the hearts of the american people are with them but by your course in the philippines the lips of the administration are sealed and there is a padlock upon their consciences no resolution of sympathy for that brave and patriotic people in their struggle for liberty can be considered in this house the republican majority here if not in actual sympathy with england are handicapped by the advocacy of her doctrines of imperialism and must stand still and witness in silence the greatest military struggle of recent times for liberty and independence and not so much as express sympathy for the brave and invincible people of the little dutch republics this is not all of imperialism it means large standing armies at home before the war with spain our regular army consisted of only 25 000 men representative of that great army of citizen soldiery engaged in the busy walks of life to whom the republic must look for support in the hour of peril but now we are asked to make the standing army 100 000 strong how long will it be if we pursue the present policies until it will be increased more and more until it will become a burden sorely to be borne by our people and become a dangerous factor in our government and in the hands of an unscrupulous and ambitious president be the means of overthrowing our own government or oppressing our people but if we are to abandon the monroe doctrine and cast aside all the warnings of the great statesmen of the past from george washington to mckinley and engage in all the european controversies and struggles for supremacy in the east we must make up our minds that the military must become the dominating power in our own government and that great armids and a navy sufficient to dominate the seas is our only safety and that trade business and labor must be taxed to pay for their support i warn the people of the dangers of great standing armies their existence is repugnant to free government and will endanger the liberties of the people i will never vote to put any nation of people under such rule those of us who come from the south have reasons for our objections to military rule we know what it means to set up military control over a people we have had the bitter experience for four years we groaned under the rule of political plunderers and military criminals and so long as i shall live i shall never consent to place that scourge upon any nation of people on earth i am not ready to abandon the policy as declared by jefferson when he said peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none this has been and should continue to be the motto of this country in its foreign relations in this way we can extend our commerce to every port in the world without the aid of great standing armies with all their attendant evils and burdens i firmly believe that we should still hold to the wise declarations announced by the father of our country in his parting words europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very re mote relation hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course if we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scruplously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giwng us provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall counsel let us all hope that in the final settlement of these great questions the wisdom and justice of the american people will prevail and that our american institutions will be preserved as a perpetual inheritance to the people of this nation as long as governments among men shall exist let our best energies be put forth to secure to all our people justice and fair treatment giving each an equal chance in the race of life believing that our territory should extend no further than our constitution laws and institutions may go i am for the republic and against the empire if there be no objection i will ask permission to print as an appendix to my remarks certain authorities and declarations of statesmen in the past"], [0.021276235580444336, 0.9787237644195557, 1, "we have been making history very rapidly during the last three years old cruel spain had put her hand on the people of cuba who had been fighting for their liberty and to be freed from this cruelty and had almost won their coveted victory when they called upon the american republic to come to their rescue when the people of america realized their condition from every section of the country from every city town and hamlet came petitions to heed the cry of suffering humanity congress appreciating the condition and the cruelty of the old monarchy passed the resolution declaring for cuban independence without a dissenting voice gave the president of the united states the right to use the army and the navy to enforce the decree congress also voted 50 000 000 and placed it at the disposal of the president to be used as lie saw fit these great galleries aro und us were packed to overflowing and they like the people of the country cheered this patriotic humane act to the echo no one considering what the cost would be either in life or property but like the true american always ready to respond to the cry of suffering humanity we had but a small army and a very insignificant navy yet in less than one hundred days the brave american boys bade goodby to father and mother and all that is most dear to american manhood and responded to the call of the president until we had builded an army that was ready to do battle for humanity we also poured the money of the treasury into the navy department and builded a navy that was ready to go forth in search of the spanish fleet i need neither speak of the brilliant victory of admiral dewey and his small band of heroes in manila bay nor of the bravery sacrifice and heroism of the boys at san juan hill we were making history then that was american and of which we were all proud we were proud to see the republic of the fathers that had sprung from english tyranny and was founded on liberty and the spirit of the golden rule freely giving its best lives and expending its money without reward or the hope thereof that another people might be freed from tyranny and given that liberty which is sweet to every american victory that was most complete and glorious was won and almost without the loss of life but this victory brought with it responsibilities thus far the people were a unitnot a disloyal heart in the whole union we had stricken down the government of spain in the bay and the president of the united states extended our authority over the entire philippine islands the question arose what shall be the attitude of the republic to the new possessions this involved duty to the republic as well as to the people of the islands we had destroyed their government were in possession and confronted with the question as to what should be the future policy toward our new possessions the minority on the floor of this house backed by the sentiment of democrats everywhere insisted that the republic should be frank and open and declare to the people of the islands and to the world what its policy would be the majority said it was not time to declare a policy that we should wait until the people of the islands were conquered until they were subdued until they had surrendered all to our army with which they could defend their rights the united states was put in the attitude of saying that we were large enough and strong enough to remain and we will not tell you what we will dodemanding a surrender of everything for which they had been fighting this i submit if the people of the islands are made of the same kind of stuff americans are would tend strongly to arouse all the fight in them i submit that the position of the administration was neither just to the people of the islands nor to the spirit of our institutions had we statd a policy that was american based upon a hundred years experience as a republic and said to them we came here by force of circumstances while fighting to free an oppressed people our responsibility is to protect the people and the property of the islands until you can establish a stable government of your own one that will protect the people and the property we will not be the judge of what the form of your government shall be but only demand that it shall be stable we advise you however to fashion and mold it after the american republic when you have established a stable government which would relieve us of our responsibility we will withdraw our army and navy and bring them and the american flag home and say to cruel spain you must keep your hands off of this little republic and to the nations of the world you shall not pounce down on these people and divide their possessions among yourselves we intend to see it nurtured cultivated and developed into a republic that loves liberty and is contro led by the spirit of the golden rule i believe the people of the islands would have seen the justness of this policy and would have hailed us as their friends and deliverers and we would have had no war with them our republican friends said to them no we will not even tell you what we are going to do we demand of you unconditional surrender at the same time many who were high in the councils of the party the president himself said who shall dare haul down the flag thereby intimating to them that they never intended to withdraw and that they intended to make this the gateway of trade to the world you have the positions contrasted the administration saying that our gateway of trade should be over an unwilling and subjugated people the democratic party saying the gateway of trade should be through a little republic builded formed and fashioned after our republic i appeal to the candor of this house which appeals to your spirit of americanism do you yet say that you are not ready to state a policy are not the taxpayers who are already carrying a great load the fathers and mothers who furnished the brave american boys to follow the flag ave the boys themselves entitled to know for what this war is being waged would it not be well now to state a policy and see if we could not bring to an end this cruel war as americans would we not stand higher in our own estimation and in the estimation of the world if we could thus bring the war to a close save the millions of dollars and the thousands of lives and the innumerable heartaches and do it along the lines laid by the fathers a hundred years ago should we not do it many loyal americans believe that if the democratic policy was now adopted the war would be brought to a close within ninety days but the administration and the republican party have declined to state any policy the last republican national platform only said in substance we will give the people of the islands such a government as they are capable of enjoying who is to be judge of their capability the administration of course subject therefore to the changes of administrations and to no constitution or declaration by which the policy could be determined the administration is driven to the position that the constitution does not follow the flag that it is only extended to the islands by an act of congress if an act of congress could carry the constitution to the islands another act could withdraw it so that it would simply be an act and not the constitution at all have we indeed outgrown our muchboasted and oftenpraised constitution which defines the right of every citizen so that the humblest may know and have every right guaranteed to him that is given to the strongest and most influential is it true from a republican standpoint that we have outgrown the declaration of independence that the founders subscribed their names to pledging their future and their all for the principles therein contained is it no longer true that all government derives its just power from the consent of the governed but yesterday during the discussion of this bill the gentleman from pennsylvania quoted from the scripture when i was a child i spake as a child when i grew to manhood i put away childish things is it his position and that of the republican party that when the fathers of our republic were fighting for liberty it was for a childish thing that the constitution upon which our republic is based is a childish thing that the declaration is a childish thing i have not so been taught but have been taught to revere them and that they are the foundation stones of our beloved republic is it true that the manly thing is to ignore the constitution declare the declaration to be a lie and establish a gateway of trade over a conquered people i am glad i am not responsible for this position or for this part of the history written by the republican administration i would rather be responsible for a policy founded on the constitution and a declaration that every act of the american republic is measured by the constitution every act of the republic is governed by the spirit of the declaration of independence and teach other nations the spirit of liberty and help them to establish a government like ours while we have been making history with reference to our new possessions we have also been making history at home the fiftysecond congress appropriated 1 000 000 000 that congress was spoken of in derision everybody admitted its extravagance and demanded a reduction of public expenditures yet this fiftysixth congress will appropriate 1 800 000 000 who will say this is economy who will dare say that i shall not raisemy voice and oppose the extravagant appropriations every dollar of which the administration is responsible for not only are we making a history of extravagance but we are making history along the lines of the hind of government we shall have from the beginning of the republic to the close of the war of 1861 there was a policy that controlled the republic in the interest of state rights and human slavery a class of loyal patriotic men believed they had the right to own the liberty and earnings of a man because he was black they could read the bible and find a precedent it was not because they were less humane than other citizens but because their interests warped their judgments and they were unable to reason correctly now we go to the other extreme the doctrine of alexander hamilton is again revived and the doctrine of a strong centralized government is in controlthat a few men shall run the government and fewer control all the business of the country until by reason of legislation by the republican party along that line trusts have been formed by the thousands we have today combinations and trusts controlling stocks of over 8 000 000 000 not for the purpose of extending trade not for the purpose of opening new factories and new mines not for starting the fires in the furnaces already in existence but for closing down factories putting out the fires in the furnace turning laboring men out by the thousands to starve or crowd out some other laboring man in order that the combines and the trusts may control the output of the manufactories and fix the price thereon this enormous power has taken hold of every business and controls everything that the american people eat or wear or with which the country is developed until today many of the articles manufactured in this country are sold at a higher price at home than they are laid down in the markets of the world i am glad also that i am not responsible for this history and i want to say to the majority of this house that if the judgment of men is warped by the greed of gain and they are placed in power and control the administration the result on the republic is quite as disastrous as if it had come from some source less pretentious no gentlemen we must not stand idly by and see this power control thegovernment control business until we have lost our individual rights until we can no longer say equal and exact justico to all exclusive privileges to none it is the duty of the representatives on the floor of this house not only to oppose such legislation but to carry the result to the people of the country and make them know where the responsibility lies for eternal vigilance is the price of liberty a price that must be paid or liberty lost liberty is not like the weeds of the field that flourish without attention rather like the precious grain that dies without attention our republican friends are not content with this history they now seek to establish a greater monopoly than has ever been heretofore establishedto have congressconvened in extraordinary session if necessary in order that they may pass what is known as the shipsubsidy bill vote out of the treasury as a subsidy to a favored few 9 000 000 a year for the next twenty years i desire for a short time to discuss what i believe to be the most vicious bill that has ever been introduced in congress and in doing so i do not desire to discuss it particularly from a partisan standpoint the evil which is complained of affects us all alike and i take it for granted that every member of this house no matter what may be his party affiliations is honestly and earnestly in favor of the professed objects of this bill those objects are the upbuilding of our merchant marine engaged in foreign trade and the encouragement of our shipbuilding interests i do not believe there is an american citizen who would not deeply regret the decadence of our shipbuilding enterprises and the diminution of our foreign trade any measure which is calculated to cause american ships to increase in number and to cause the american nation to once more resume her proud position as the mistress of the seas would receive the hearty support of every member of this house and the reasonable cost of achieving so great a result would not for one moment be considered by the patriotic taxpayers of the united states if an increase of foreign trade an increase of american shipbuilding and an increase in the percentage of our foreign trade carried in american ships can be purchased then our business instincts would prompt us to close any reasonable deal that could be made but the student of this bill will look in vain for any provision which requires the delivery of what we are supposed to buy it provides for the opening of no new ports it provides for the establishment of no new lines of steamships it provides for no reduction in freight rates it provides for the running of no new ships it provides it is true for the building of new ships but these ships can be built forless than the subsidy paid and there is no provision which prevents them from being sold to foreign companies as soon as completed if our foreign trade were decreasing the necessity for some measure which would arrest that decrease would be apparent but as a matter of fact our foreign trade during the past ten years has increased more rapidly than that of any other nation on earth if our shipbuilding interests were decreasing the necessity for prompt and efficient measures for the upbuilding of that great line of industry would be plain our shipbuilding interests have during the past few years shown the largest percentage of increase they have ever shown the second largest shipbuilding plant in the world is an american plant the united states has the second largest merchant navy in the world when we prescribe remedies in the way of legislation for evils which exist we must first analyze those evils in the present case the evil is not in the volume of our foreign trade nor is it in our shipbuilding industry both are in exceedingly healthy condition the only source of dissatisfaction in connection with our shipping interest is that our foreign trade is conducted to a very large extent by foreign vessels it is a matter of just pride to every american that the stars and stripes should be the most familiar flag in the seaports of the world it is a matter for regret that our ships are more seldom seen on the ocean highways than they were half a century ago the fact that our merchant marine has largely gone out of the foreign carrying business is due to several causes the first of these was the decadence of the wooden ship and the substitution of iron vessels the next cause was that during the civil war our merchants and manufacturers were pushed to extremes in order to supply local demands and the english merchants and manufacturers taking advantage of this condition wrested a large share of the foreign trade from the united states this brought about a new condition which prevails to a very considerable extent at the present time the united states became an exporting and not an importing nation its exports were of agricultural products to the extent of threefourths of the total amount exorted the united states supplied food to all of the nations of urope its imports have decreased from 16 per capita in 1873 to 9 per capita in 1899 the exports increased from 7 per capita to 16 per capita the importers of the united states changed their manner of doing business they had formerly owned their ships and sent those ships to all parts of the world in order to buy goods as the nations of europe were compelled to send their ships to the united states in order to secure food the importer no longer sent his ships abroad but remained in his countinghouse and bought his goods from foreign exporters when their ships visited this country when the european wants grain or other american products he sends his ships to the united states laden with goods which are not ordered but which he hopes to sell he disposes of his cargo loads his ships with the american goods he wants and returns to his native country the new york importer has purchased his goods delivered in new york the american exporter has sold his goods delivered in new york and neither the american importer or exporter has any choice iu the flag of the ship by which the goods were transported when stephen girard and other noted early merchants in the united states were scouring the world for goods the american shipping interests were in the same condition as are now the english shipping interests the english merchant is an importer and not an exporter the goods he exports are sent for the purpose of exchanging for the goods which he desires to import that the british subsidyif subsidy it can be called it being a mere payment for services renderedhas nothing to do with the success of british shipping is shown conclusively by the fact that less than 10 per cent of the british merchant marine is subsidized in fact the vast proportion of the freight of the world is carried on tramp vessels the united states is a producing country it produces a vast amount of what it consumes the nations of europe are so densely populated that it is impossible for them to produce a sufficient quantity of food products to sustain the population the law of selfpreservation therefore prompts those countries to establish speedy and efficient means of transportation to and from the united states the united states upon the other hand has no incentive to send its grain to europe for the reason that the europeans will send after it the united states has no incentive to send ships after european goods because the european merchants and manufacturers will bring those goods to the united states the american consuls in foreign countries have without exception complained that the united states merchants and manufacturers show an indifference to foreign trade and do not enter into active competition with the merchants and manufacturers of other countries and yet notwithstanding this fact so great is the natural advantage of the united states by reason of its being the largest producing country in the world that our foreign trade grows far more rapidly than does the foreign trade of any other nation there is another reason for european countries expending money upon merchant marine which is unnecessary in this country under the same principle which prompted the united states to aid the union pacific railroad in order to establish speedy communications between the different parts of the country the european nations having distant colonial possessions have sought to establish adequate means of communication between those possessions and the mother countries it is a fact shown by the official record that a considerable percentage of american vessels now engaged in the foreign trade clear in ballast it is therefore not a lack of american ships which causes this small percentage of the foreign trade carried on american bottoms but this small percentage is caused by the fact that the freight is sent in foreign ships to increase the number of american ships would not increase the amount of american freight carried by them the foreign purchaser and not the american seller chooses the ship which is to carry the goods there is another condition which explains the difference between the american shipping interests and those of other countries i refer to the american coastwise trade the united states has a greater coast line than is owned by all of the european nations combined the european nations have comparatively little coast trade they therefore enter into close competition for openocean business the openocean businiess has brought about so sharp and bitter a competition that all of the nations complain of the decadence of their profits from shipping the vessel owners of the united states have a monopoly of the coast trade of the united states and that coast trade is growing so rapidly that competition has as yet been felt but little the result is that the american shipowner after looking over the condition of the foreign trade declines to enter upon the uncertainties of that business and goes into the business which offers sure profits he would do this even in case of a subsidy being offered established lines might to some extent increase their facilities in the foreign trade but new lines would not embark in the hazardous project of competing with foreign lines when the coastwise trade offers them protection from such competition this is not the first proposition for the subsidy of american ships engaged in foreign trade the united states has tried this plan upon several occasions and each time with disastrous results the collins lines the pacific mail the brazilian line and the venezuelan line were all subsidized and in no case did the subsidy increase our trade foreign countries have not had any more favorable experience with the subsidy plan of building up their merchant marine the state department last year sent to the consuls of the united states on duty in foreign countries asking them for reports upon the success of subsidies in foreign countries the following answers were received austra subsidized in 1891 during the past ten years there has been no appreciable increase either in the number of vessels or in tonnage and there has been a decrease in the number of seamen belgium no subsidy the merchant marine of belgium has shown a steady increase ever since 1859 and now consists of 90 971 tons as against 26 000 tons in 1870 deniark no subsidy the danish merchant marine consisted on the 1st of march 1899 of 3 170 sailing vessels of a gross tonnage of 186 000 tons and 505 steamers of a gross tonnage of 387 200 tons against 3 199 sailing vessels of a gross tonnage of 192 100 tons and 442 steamers of a gross tonnage of 276 800 tons on the 1st of april 1897 frane heavily subsidized the report of the committee of the house of deputies appointed to examine the budget of the minister of commerce for 1899 says we do nothesitate to say without any fear of contradiction that our merchant marine is in such a state of decadence that there is reason to be uneasy about our navy fleet it is no longer a question as is the case with the merchant marine of england and germany of competing with foreign ships in their own ports we have seen from the statistics of navigation that even in french ports we find it difficult to obtain a proper share of our own freight mr charles roux in his able study of the french merchant navy says the decadence which is menacing us is increasing every day and if we do not take care it is to be feared that before the formidable clan of foreign fleets our merchant navy in a very brief time will fall into complete ruin gemany subsidizes by postal contracts only the growth of the german merchant marine has been steady and satisfactory since 1870 in addition to subsidies there have been a large number of special favors granted and the government has practically built and established several of the steamship lines italy subsidized the merchant marine of italy is practically at a stan dstill netherlands no subsidy the merchant marine of the netherlands is now 374 213 tons an increase of 12 000 in the past year united kinodom generally reported subsidized but as a matter of fact not subsidized the official report says the government of this country does not pursue any particular policy for the purpose of promoting its merchant marine subventions are paid for the use of certain vessels as armed cruisers in case of war and payments are made for the carriage of mails united states no subsidy growth of merchant marine from 3 477 801 tons in 1890 to 4 338 145 tons in 1960 with the exception of england no country which grants subsidies has increased its merchant marine while all nations which did not grant a subsidy enjoyed a substantial increase in the case of england the subsidies so called are no more than mail contracts and are let out on bids it is necessary for england to sustain an extensive foreign mail connection in order to keep in touch with her widely separated colonies it seems singular that in all of the arguments in favor of subsidizing the merchant marine so much is said as to the resulting increase of shipping and foreign trade not one of those who have thus dwelt upon the advantages to be derived from more ships and a greater foreign trade has cited a single instance where a subsidy has ever brought about an increase in the nvimber of ships or of the trade they carried as a matter of fact the result of subsidies has always been to decrease the number of ships and the trade carried upon them the reason for this is obvious if a line is established and paid a subsidy the subsidy enables it to shut off competition by unsubsidized lines a subsidized company will run as many ships and no more as will pay the largest dividends it creates a monopoly in that trade a monopoly never seeks to extend its transactions in uncertain and untried fields a subsidy stifles competition it creates an inequality between the subsidized lines and those which are not subsidized that must of necessity result in the destruction of the latter it makes it possible for a combination between large ship companies by which a gigantic trust could easily be organized which would control not only the foreign trade but the coastwise traffic as well a combination of our largest shipbuilding plants and shipping companies with arge english concerns would make it possible to operate together in such a manner as to close out all of the individual shipowners and small companies in both the foreign trade and the coastwise trade the amount of subsidies islimited to 9 000 000 a year it would be a very easy matter for such a combination to so transfer its vessels as to take the whole of this amount from the start and ruin our shipping industry in reading over the bill it will be noticed that there is no agreement in the contract proposed to be entered into between the shipowners and the united states government other than that the shipowners agree to build additional ships in american yards the united states government wants an increase in american ships engaged in foreign trade and a reduction of freight rates this bill provides for neither it does not compel a single ship to be run nor do the recipients of the subsidy agree to make any reduction whatever in freight rates in buying a thing which costs 9 000 000 a year ordinary prudence would seem to dictate that some provision be made for securing what we buy after we have paid for it but there is no such provision in this bill it is a proposition pure and simple that if these gentlemen will use a part of the money as investments for their own benefit in americanbuilt ships we will give them 9 000 000 a year out of the public treasury for their individual profit and let them keep the ships they have bought they can run them or sell them as they see fit i can not vote for a measure like this it looks to me like a scheme to form a gigantic shipping trust which will ruin thousands of poor men now engaged in the shipping busifiess and place it in the power of a gigantic corporation to raise freight rates at will i am in favor of any measure which will tend to the upbuilding of our merchant marine i am not opposed to expending a reasonable amount of money if by its expenditure we can make our people a seagoing people i would be proud to hail the day when the stars and stripes float in every port in christendom i think it would be wise and prudent for the government to foster and encourage in any practicable manner the building and sailing of ships but i can not see that this bill if enacted into law will produce any such effect the history of the past shows it wouldnot this bill is an unfair discrimination against the toilers of the nation like much republican legislation it permits the big fish to swallow the little ones i desire to quote at some length from the speech of senator clay delivered in the senate of the united states december 13 1900"], [0.026670098304748535, 0.9733299016952515, 1, "i move to strike out the last word in the course of the debate on yesterday i asked the gentleman from west virginia a question i asked if ie lid not support the law passed by the fiftyfifth congress to erect a smokeless gunpowder factory for the government he did not deny he voted for it but said we ordered it built because we were then at war with spain as i remember the republican party as a unit in the house supported that measure and in addition to that i find on inquiry at the navy department that the secretary of the navy before the war and in 1897 requested congress to erect a powder factory war was declared against spain in april 1898 so the statement that we had a war on and hence ordered the building of this factory falls to the ground the historic fact is that congress by request of the secretary of the navy authorized the appropriation before the war now you will find that the secretary in his recent report commends the establishment of this powder factory in this language the government powder factory at indian head is progressing favorably it is neither expected nor desired to enter into competition at these works with private manufacturers except as to quality it being the policy of the department to foster the commercial industry uponwhich the country must largely draw for its supply i find in the secretarys report for 1897 on page 295 the statement of admiral oneil requesting congress to erect this powder factory i desire the house to listen attentively to the particular language that i shall now read admiral oneil said the bureau is of opinion that for national and economic reasons the department should own and operate a smokelesspowder factory at which it could produce a part of the powder required for the naval service and an item has been inserted in the annual estimatesafor this purpose the property known as bellevuu magazine on the potomac just below washington would be an excellent site and it is conveniently reached by water and by railroad and it is but two hours distance from the naval proving ground the present price of the smokeless powder procured by purchase is very high and the bureau believes it can produce it in large quantities at a greatly reduced price the success of the bureau with its gun factory encourages it to believe that it could do equally well in the manufacture of other munitions of war our gun factory he says is such a success he urges a government powder factory and ir secretary long indorsed his recommendation it will be seen that in the fiftyfifth congress on the recoimendation of mr secretary long we passed an appropriation going into millions of dollars to erect a powder factory including a smokelesspowder factory and what for in order that we might crush the monopoly that has had the united states government by the throat that he might get a better quality of powder that he might get more powder for the same amount of money that we might have the machinery in our own hands and not be the victims as we have been heretofore as in the case of our armor plate of the manufacturers mr long says page 22 in his report for 1897 that there was a lack of sufficient competition among private manufacturers we make naval clothing at our new york naval factory this is indorsed by mr long and the congress and yet the gentleman from illinois always alert about appropriations twitted

of the united states not only in this department but in all the others the gentleman from illinois made al earnest appeal almost with tears in his eyes a while ago to raise the salaries of the letter

always nine more standing at the door try ing to get in for every one already in there are hundreds and thousanih5 of them outside anxious and eager to get in where these men are serving such a laborious term of service for so little wages go to the departments of this government today and you will find them running over each other in each others way and if you want to do some service to tile taxpayers introducea bill that would turn out onethird and make the other twothirds d the work and then you can reduce the expenses and maybe raise the salaries a little bit but in the name of conscience stop this indecent haste in increasing salaries where in many instances they are already too high i want to say that i have no general criticism to make of the bill that has been brought in by the posoffice committee except as to one or two items in connection with amounts to be paid railroads and one or two others i believe it is just 1 believe it is right because it is a service rendered all the people fourteen millions seems to be a large sum for free delivery in cities and t wns but when you extend the same privilege to the people in the country i make no objection i took the position in the fiftythird congress that the people in the country had as much right td free delivery of mail as the people in the cities for they are the bone and sinew of the country i then began a war to that end and with others in the house notably mr williamrs of mississippi anl mr moses of georgia succeeded in that congress in getting an appropriation of 20 000 for free delivery in the country to the men who work on the farms and in the workshops in the fields and at the forge and this was the beginfing of the free rural delivery of any practical kind which has already resulted in disseminating knowledge into the backwoods of the country home since that time it has been increased by persistent effort from congress to congress to 100 000 then to 150 000 and then to 300 000

to quote from a letter written march 1898 to him by the assistant postmastergeneral mr shallenberger who in this letter says the railway mail service has improved since 1893 eight years since no one disputes that fact we know it is a fact and on all the railroads and on stage lines and boat lines we submit indeed all freight lines have improved in speed in the last ten years yea the last two years and they are not subsidized not at all general shallenberger says in these hearings page 452 that within that time since 1893 when he testified before this committee december 3 1898 almost every other road has increased the speed of its trains but they are not all subsidized but few are the southern being one but in this letter of mr shallenberger he does not say that this subsidy caused any of these roads to increase their speed he guards against any such language he says since 1893 the trains have run faster but does not say the subsidy made them do so on the contrary his letter shows that the unsubsidized train no 37 takes just thirty minutes longer time to run from new york to new orleans than the subsidized train and just one hour and fifteen minutes longer in running to tampa this you can read for yourselves in his letter to the gentleman from virginia at page 689 of the hearings here sir is your own evidence your own letter shall we pay thousands and thousands of the peoples money yearly to get a subsidized speed that we get in unsubsidized trains gratis is that just is it fair to the people who pay for it all our pay to carry the mail as freight to this southern road every year is 1 194 449 of which 171 238 35 is a subsidy to carry this mail from new york to new orleans when we see the unsubsidized train no 37 makes the trip in just thirty minutes longer time than the subsidized train again train no 35 subsidized now takes exactly thirtyfive minutes longer to make the new orleans trip from new york than in 1893 before it was subsidized how is that for reform and speed the swanson letter was written on march 3 1898 and beforeexactly nine months beforegeneral shallen berger deposed and said to the committee that since then he had for the use of this committee mr grant assistant superintendent of the railroad service prepare a statement from official data which he says is authoritative and to be preferred to any statement i can make from memory you can see this language and grants statement on page 451 of the hearings this official letter based on authoritative data gives the names of several lines that make better time without the subsidy than others with it and those which had dropped the subsidy were still carrying the mail in exactly the same schedules not varying one iota i quoted this letter here the other day in a speech it is not disputed grant says it is correct shallenberger says so this committee all of them but two out of seven agree thissubsidy is not needed and those twoone a member of the house and one a senatorsay it is necessary and neither prove it is so but quote shallenberger in the support of their position and shallenberger says he does not need or want the subsidy and winds up his testimony by saying there is now december 182i 3 no justification for the department paying the money to secure reasonable service and then he was asked this question at the conclusion of his examination you understand that their systems have reached thatpoint so that you can get just as good speed without the money as with it a that is the idea that is the departmental position is it yes it is not now necessary you see grant either and the actual visible running of the trains with and without extra pay shows and proves this and then shallenberger says this subsidy makes it harder to make contracts with the unsubsidized trains and for that reason also protests against this appropriation with this proof before us with great respect for those who for local or other reasons differ with us our duty is plain

inasmuch as we are now discussing the appropriations for the diplomaticconsular service i wish to make a few observations on the conditions governing the conduct of the civilized nations of the world according to the dispatch quoted above the english government which is considered the most powerful nation in the eastern hemisphere not only uses its own vast power and resources in the crushing out of the two boer republics but insists on the strength of the agreement about to be entered into with portugal that the portuguese government which has possessions controlling points of advantage to both the boer and british forces will assist the british government in the conquest and subjugation of the boer republics i think it is proper that the american people should be made to realize the great battle that is now going on in different parts of the world for empire and dominion the american people are by instinct liberty loving and humane and i can not doubt if an opportunity was given them to express their judgment upon the conflict now going on in south africa that they would sympathize deeply with the heroic struggle of the two republics against the british empire no expression of opinion has been allowed in this body and the american people ought to know the reason why why is it that the resolutions of sympathy introduced into this house months ago have been allowed to

states to the other in the purchase of horses mules guns munitions of war of all kinds while the representatives of the boer republic are denied that privilege is it not a tremendous indictment

representatives of the boer republics as are allowed to the representatives of the english government i make the charge on the floor of this house that the present administration as far as its official conduct can be determined in the present struggle between england and the boer republics has favored the cause of great britain i claim that when the war first broke out that it was the duty of the administration to cause it to be understood that the boer republics were entitled to the rights of belligerents and that they would not be molested if their representatives sought this country for the purchase of supplies for their army i think if this administration displayed that spirit of justice and humanity which is so characteristic of the american people and which for all time has so

fairly with the educated and wellpaid labor of native and naturalized americans that is the position this government may take with reference to the philippine islands when the question arises no such condition exists with respect to puerto rico with respect to cuba there need be no fear of a precedent because it is our purpose to grant to the people of that island a free and independent government then we shall deal with her by treaty or tariff laws as we deal with the other nations of the world that congress has the power to take care of the philippine question when it comes has not only been admitted by the gentlemen who have discussed the legal proposition but in the report of the majority of the committee which accompanies this bill we find the following on this question the representative of the beetsugar industry who appeared before your committee stated that the admission of sugar free of duty from puerto rico even should the product be doubled would work no injury to the beetsugar interests his fears were that this original bill might be regarded asaprecedent for free sugar from the philippine islands and eventually from cuba it is a sufficient answer to this that the substitute reported establishes no precedent on the contrary we expressly assert by this substitute the right to discriminate between puerto rico or the philippine islands and the united states cuba is to have a government of its own and there is no menace to the beetsugar inductry from that quarter surely the party which had the courage to provide adequate protection in 1897 for this new industryr can be safely trusted to foster it now it has passed beyond the stage of experiment and is an assured success so that the claim that this legislation is required as a precedent when we come to deal with the philippine islands and cuba is destroyed by their own report and arguments to summarize briefly there is no need of this legislation for protective purposes that is conceded there is no need of it as a precedent because if congress has the power to enact this law it will have the same power to enact a similar law for the philippine islands if we open our markets to the products of puerto rico the rich and fertile soil spoken of by the gentleman from new york will be made to bloom and blossom as the rose and enable them to pay taxes liberally for the support of their school system and home government every legal and humane reason exists for the defeat of this measure and the establishment of free trade between the united states and puerto rico president mckinley in his annual message read at the opening of this congress said our plain duty is to abolish all castoms tariffs betwen the united states and puerto rico and give her products free access to our markets is oru duty any less plain now than it was then conditions have not changed these people are now suffering poverty and starvation since spain has enacted a high and prohibitive tariff they have had no market for their products their lands are uncultivated their people are idle and men women and children hungry and suffering are looktng across the waters to us with all our wealth prosperity and happiness and are asking and pleading that we open our ample markets to the products of which their little island is capable demanding that we grant to them the immunities privileges blessings liberty and civilization we so bountifully promised and if this great nation is just and true to its promises if we want the future good will and loyal allegiance of these people and the respect of the rest

committed to bimetallism just as much as the democratic party was but my friend has suddenly undergone a transformation for in reply to a question from my colleague he heaped scorn upon the platform of his own party and declared himself an uncompromising champion of the single gold standard in the first congress that assembled after the election in 1896 a gentleman from new york by the name of lemuel eli quigg had the audacity to stand on this floor and utter just such a sentiment as that proclaimed by the gentleman from iowa in an instant the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from iowa now in the chair pounced with ferocity upon that unfortunate person and when they got through with lemuel eli his mother would not have known him if she had met him at the door the gentleman from iowa now presiding read the republican platform of 1896 denounced the assertion that it had pledged the republican party to the gold standard and declared that any republican who opposed bimetallism was an apostate to republican ism and faithless to the pledges of the republican party i thought it would be interesting to my friend from iowa to know what his distinguished colleague who is now in the chair thinks of his conduct i would be glad to know how many more recreants and apostates there are on that side of the chamber if there are any who disagree with my friend from iowa let them stand up it is interesting to see the entire republican party from the president down abandoning its platform and its pledges and rallying to a new war cry under the glorious leadership of lemuel eli quigg let us pause for a moment to ask whether in fact present conditions have vindicated the advocates of the gold standard in the last campaign let us see what was the issue joined between the republican and democratic parties in that campaign the democrats contended that the free coinage of silver would increase the prices of commodities and that rising prices meant prosperity our opponents admitted that the free coinage of silver would cause arise in prices but they said that the effect of this would be ruin and disaster the democrats declared that the effect of the gold standard was to depress prices and that this meant depression in trade and universal hard times the republicans admitted that the effect of the gold standard was to beat down the prices of commodities but they declared that this condition was favorable to the great masses of the people the real issue joined between us and the question of debate was between higher and lower prices wherever you went you declared it was your purpose to increase the purchasing power of the workingmans dollar by keeping down the prices of all the necessaries of life you appealed to the great army of pensioners throughout the country by telling them that the democrats would increase prices and thereby diminish the value of their income one of the greatest advocates of the gold standard made a speech in my city in which he said that he was glad that the prices of farm products were low and he hoped they would go lower because the lower they went the greater would be the purchasing power of the poor mans dollar now sir it is true that we have better times it is true that we have a measure of prosperity but it has come with a rise in the prices of commodities with a decrease in the purchasing power of every dollar in the country it has come through the very conditions which it was the avowed purpose of the gold standard to prevent it has come through the very conditions which you yourselves have said the free coinage of silver would create why sir your candidate for president mr mckinley declared that he was opposed to any policy that would reduce the purchasing power of the dollar or in other words to any policy that would increase prices yet you have the nerve to stand here and boast of the fact that prices have increased and that the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased has your policy brought this about if so i want to tell you that mr mckinley is opposed to it you solemnly promised in the last campaign that you would defeat the base conspiracy to increase prices and thereby reduce the purchasing power of the workingmans dollar and now you think you ought to have a chromo because you have failed to do it i had hoped to say something with regard to the real causes of improved conditions and also in regard to the increased gold supply so often adverted to in this debate but i see that my time is about to expire and i can not enter upon the discussion of those questions i

temporary advantage for the approaching campaign i can not think such claims are seriously made such statements and claims are not worthy of the men on the other side of this chamber not worthy the

at the trust a blow it is said that will not hit or hurt a blow a long way off it is said and yet if the other side will join with this the moral effect will be potent if the trust is that menace to our future which it is claimed to be this law will at least be a discouragement and if you will join with us the force of the blow will in my judgment be effectual the democracy in its platforms and through its leaders has asked for such legislation i call your attention to the platform of yourpartyin 1888 this was made when grover cleveland was president and is as follows judged by democratic principles the interests of the people are betrayed when by unnecessary taxation trusts and combinations are permitted and fostered which while unduly enriching the few that combine rob the body of our citizens by depriving them as purchasers of the benefits of natural competition this was simply a declaration no remedy was suggested in 1892 your party went still further and demanded a rigid enforcement of the law the sherman law a republican law you passed no law you did not even attempt to pass one you did not even introduce a bill you were content with the law put upon the statute books in enduring form by the republican party and then after four years of power evidently feeling that the scepter was to pass from you because of your failure to keep faith with the people you demanded in 1892 the enforcement by the republican party of the law you had not changed or tried to change here is your declaration we recognize in the trusts and combinations which are designed to enable capital to secure more than its just share of the joint product of capital and labor a natural consequence of the prohibitive taxes which prevent the free competition which is the life of honest trade but we believe their worst evils can be abated by law and we demand the rigid enforcement of the laws made to prevent and control them together with such further legislation in restraint of their abuses as experience may show to be necessary then in 1896 in the platform upon which mr bryan stood and upon which he asserts he will stand again you declared for control of the trusts by the federal government here again is your declaration the absorption of wealth by the few the consolidation of our leading railroad systems and the formation of trusts and pools require a stricter control by the federal government of those arteries of commerce later mr bryan in his speech at the chicago antitrust meeting spoke for a constitutional amendment similar to the one under consideration you repudiate his position simply because you fear that such an amendment would curtail some of the cherished state rights of some of the states of the union which in the judgment of some gentlemen on the other side are of more importance than the union itself the trouble with your party is that there are so many inharmonious and discordant elements within it that you could not carry out your purposes if you in good faith desired to do so and your only answer to the people is that the republicans too are following your example of holding out false hopes to the people judge not lest ye be also judged my friends i implore gentlemen of the other side to forget for the moment all party hatred party strife and party fealty to rise above party and cast one vote for the good of all let us rise to the old heroic heights rise to the level of our common manhood and declare and show that we will not be slaves to trusts or combines that we will not be unjust to capital and

in aid of navigation it is possible that some of the members of the house withhold their votes from amendments of this character for the reason that they do not understand thoroughly what the people of the arid and semiarid regions of the country ask of the general government in the matter of appropriations directly or indirectly in the interest of irrigation we hear a great deal about the

run to waste and cause destruction in the lower courses of the navigable rivers of the country calling for vast appropriations annually to repair the damage wrought and we hold that there is no valid

reservoiring of the flood waters of the west will not make it easier or cheaper to irrigate the arid lands of the west but will make it possible for the people of that region to utilize the entire flow of the streams in that part of the country we ask that the general government shall only undertake the admittedly public work of storing and conserving the flood waters preventing flo6d

the various propositions that were there submitted this statement is a true statement there were no differences of opinion that were material between the various leading republicans when assembled at st louis upon the question of what the platform should be upon the subject of the currency i hold in my hands a poll of the members of the committee on resolutions made before they had assembled and

majority of that committee were in favor even prior to their assemblage at st louis of putting into the platform a declaration in favor of the gold standard and that the only controversy that arose at st louis or has ever arisen since that time among republicans has been the question of who favored certain wording certain expressions certain mere verbiage in the platform but so it was that finally under the guidance of the distinguished senator from ohio senator foraker who had in his possession all the propositions that had been made two or three of which are accredited to myself and one or more to the distinguished speaker of this house out of all these propositions was molded the platform about which there was no dispute and which advocated a declaration by the republican party in
