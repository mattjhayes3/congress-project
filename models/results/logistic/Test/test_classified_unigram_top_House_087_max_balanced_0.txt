dared suggest that we follow the shoddy road of appeasement but this is the era of dogooders and fuzzy thinkers and what a hollow mockery recent events are making of this once proud nation the few short years i have been privileged to serve as a member of congress have filled me with growing alarm for the future of our nation i cannot help but echo the cry of those americans who try to follow and understand the tortuous reasoning of our government in foreign affairs what in the name of all that is holy is going on i ask the members of this house to stop and consider these facts first for the past 6 months perhaps longer the central intelligence agency was spending a reported 45 million to finance the abortive overthrow of castro second our government is engaged in persuading our reluctant friends in the organization of american states to impose sanctions on this bloody dictator third on may 24 1961just last weekthe governing council of the united nations special fund voted to send castro 1 147 000 in technical aid and assistance of which the united states voluntarily contributes 40 percent we spend some 45 million to overthrow castroand the u n sends him half a million dollars of our money in aid now we are engaged in trying to buy back our selfrespect with 15 million worth of tractors i am fully aware that this great civic effort has the backing of the president of the united states and of many members of congress i know too that many citizens feel that it is humane and are willing to swallow their pride and bow to castos demands well i am not and i do not think the majority of americans are such action establishes a precedent and opens the door for every smalltime dictator to demand tribute who will be next to levy such a demand upon this nation but is it any wonder that this comic opera dictator dares to tweak the eagles beak is it any wonder that this nation is becoming the laughingstock of the world certainly i feel sorry for the plight of the 1 200 cubans held as prisoners but what about the american prisoners that he holds or those reputed to be held by red china or russia or the property castro seized in cuba from americans and american firms i hear no offer ringing through this land to buy tractors to free the forgotten americans now in communist jails i hear of no great civic undertaking to reimburse those whose property was stolen i doubt that any member of this house would dare face the disabled veterans of korea or those exprisoners of war who languished for endless months in communist compoundswith the lame excuse that paying tribute to castro is the humanitarian thing to do it would indeed be humane to free the cuban people from the despots heel we could if we so chose starve him out of power we could burn him out or we could blast him out instead our friends in the united nationswhose loyalty we supposedly bought over the years with billions of taxpayers moneyvote instead to try and smother him with dollars our dollars i might add president kennedy stood before this congress and said the congress and the american people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization policies and control are necessary to insure the maximum coordination and use of all political economic and psychological resources in the attainment of our objective i have faith in the ability of the president to carry out his statement to the fullest but let this house remember that it too has a responsibility to the american people i do not believe that this congress should sit idly by while the fate of our nation hangs in the balance and a handful of bureaucrats and our international friends are busy sawing at the thread the law of averages would have it that our decisions in the field of foreign affairs would be right and consistent at least half the time i cannot believe that we are consistently wrong by accident we have suffered constant and humiliating defeats in our cold war efforts our inconsistencies are beyond belief stop and consider we spend money to destroy a dictator at the same time we are spending money to support his regime in power and as an act of contribution for our attempts to bring liberty and freedom to an enslaved people we send him 15 million in tribute we are engaged in a deadly battle with communism we spend billions to thwart its expansion at the same time we are sending hundreds of millions in aid to communist nations to help them grow stronger in the battle against us we refuse to recognize red china or to trade with her yet our closest alliesto whom we opened wide our treasury in their darkest hour of needfind the glitter of gold more rewarding than principle they carry on a lavish and growing trade with one of our most deadly enemies the

and take appropriate action first if there are those within the department of state the cia our united nations delegations our agencies and our bureaus whose inadequate and reckless decisions are our stumbling blocksthey should be removed quickly second if there are those within our government whose cold and calculated decisions are made with the full knowledge and intent to destroy our nationthey should be rooted out and prosecuted the action taken by the united nations special fund last week is one of many examples of our ridiculous policy and of taxpayers money being used against the best interests of this nation it is my intention to vigorously oppose the appropriation of funds in certain portions of the department of state bill later this week when this bill is before the house i

support the u n i urge the members of this body to heed the warning from their constituents who i know must share the same alarm as those i represent and that they press for appropriate investigation by the house to those americans who feel they must donate to the tribute fund to a bloodyhanded dictatori can only say that we should have learned by now that money cannot buy selfrespect any more

from pennsylvania lmr van zandt and the gentleman from iowa have in the past week set forth all the fundamental issues including the technical aspects involved in the 1962 version of the hanford plan i feel that it would be extremely difficult for anyone aside from our friends in the northwest whose constituencies would become beneficiaries of this proposed grant from the american taxpayersin fact it would be impossible for anyone after reading those analysesto accept the allegation that this is anything but an attempt to put across an undertaking that this very congress specifically emphatically and repeatedly rejected less than a year ago in 1961 we proved to the satisfaction of a very great majority of members of congress that the hanford power station would be impractical and uneconomic today we are asked to reverse ourselves and agree to the construction of the exact same facilities except that the cost has increased substantially in the intervening months now of course we are told that this threeparty arrangementwith the atomic energy commission the washington public power supply system and bonneville power administration participatingremoves the federal subsidy provision from the project nonsense put the washington public power supply system on its own and no one would buy a dimes worth of bonds to finance hanford if some of the allegations that have been bandied around by proponents are true then why must washington public power supply system enter into this weird agreement to provide more electricity to an outfit that already has surplus power and is another losing cause sponsored and kept in business by the unitedstates taxpayer washington public power supply system is already building other facilities in fact it has an application for a license for a 3 000 000kilowatt hydroelectric plant at nez perce or mountain sheep but no hanford is a proved loser from the start so the only way that this ridiculous scheme can now become a reality is to have washington guarantee to subsidize it by picking up the tab for bonnevilles losses here are the reasons why i am going to vote against hanford and for an amendment to kill it once and for all first i consider it most imprudent that this matter comes before us again after our experience of last year when we assumed that the issue had been settled at least for the life of the 87th congress second neither engineering nor research has provided any development to make the powerplant more efficient than it was on the blueprint last year if we are to continue to be harassed with this fantasy about waste steam then i suggest that we can save the taxpayer money by putting in turkish baths instead of taking him to the cleaners through an unrealistic powerplant third i refuse to subscribe to any plan whereby unitedstates treasury funds would give one region of our country a decided advantage over my constituency and yours in the competition for new and expanded industry we have many depressed areas in western pennsylvania and it is ridiculous to expect us to vote appropriations that would subsidize pacific northwest power thus making that area more attractive to plants and factories we are willing to compete fairly for new business but we cannot beat you if you are going to use our own money against us fourth with the northwest already swamped with surplus power paid for by the american taxpayer the new capacity at hanford would only serve to increase this surplus and give added emphasis to demands for federal transmission lines all over the country we who want to see our coal and railroad industries revived are not so naive as to believe that hanford power would not eventually move right into markets now being served by solid fuel thus hanford would not only deprive coal miners in the state of washington from the jobs they need it would also come east and snatch employment opportunities from states east of the mississippi river i ask my friends in the house to oppose hanford it is a bad project all around i have just read the following protest against not only the hanford project but more so against the method being employed in the efforts of its proponents to pass it in this fashion dear congressman we wish you to know that our committee on national legislation has again taken a position against the effort to authorize the construction of electric generating facilities in conjunction with the atomic energy operation at hanford wash we believe the further expansion of public power is wrong and certainly not in the best interests of the people of pennsylvania in the past you stood opposed to action to this end and we sincerely hope that you and your associates in the house of representatives will reaffirm your position on this important question on a direct approach this proposal was twice defeated it appears to me that this project has the proverbial nine lives of an alley cat the information on this project will not be available under the procedure to give the members all of the facts pertaining thereto i therefore oppose the present package deal unless we can successfully amend the legislation to restrict it to its original intent and purpose on two occasions during the last session of the congress members of this house spoke out in no uncertain terms on a proposal to convert a plutonium reactor at the hanford wash atomic installation into a public power project an appropriation of some 90 million to install the needed power generating facilities was defeated by substantial majoritiesnot once but twice the members of this house have made it abundantly clear that they are opposed to using this atomic installationbuilt for an entirely different purposeto enhance the nations rapidly growing public power empire to the detriment of the free enterprise electric power system and to the coal industry which provides the fuel for producing 67 percent of the nations electric power yet here we are today faced once more with the same old hanford public power project this project seems to have more lives than a cat its supporters refuse to let it die they are here today trying to do indirectly what the members of this house have said on two occasions they cannot do directly this is a subterfuge which i as one opponent of this project and as a member who voted on two occasions with the majority to kill it deeply resent today we are told that the project we are considering is entirely differentthat it will be a nonfederal projectthat it will not cost the federal government one cent some 800 000 kilowatthours of electric power will be generated at a federal installation through generating facilities ostensibly owned by a combine of public power districts in the state of washington the fact remains that by terms of this proposal a huge block of power will be generated by public agencies and thus there will be denied to private power companies in that region the opportunity to meet this requirement i am not always opposed to public power projects i am however opposed to those projects such as this which are of a backdoor nature if we are to have a public policy that the nations power needs are to be provided by the government then let us at least be straightforward about it some members say let us turn the whole job over to the tennessee valley authority the bonneville power administration or to some specially created federal agencies to carry out the will of congress if that be its will but i am violently opposed to expanding the public power sector of our economy through backdoor tactics or subterfuge i challenge the advocates of the amendment by the gentleman from california to bring this matter to the floor under its true naturethat is an extension of public power they will not do this they know this house would no more accept the conversion of the hanford reactor to a public power project today than it would last session the house is opposed to the hanford project when it is presented on the correct basis leaving aside all of the claims and statistics there is one overriding matter involved here today and that is whether the house wants to encourage the expansion of public power at the expense of private enterprise that is the only questionnot whether the federal government or some other public agency will be responsibleor whether the cost will be borne by the federal government or the taxpayers of some other governmental unit the principle is the same it is this principle of favoring public power over private powerthat i oppose we all know that the great west coast regionfrom the mexican to the canadian borderwill have to have tremendously larger amounts of power in the years ahead are private utilities to be foreclosed from sharing in this expansion if we approve the holifleld amendment today we are putting the private utilities at a decided disadvantage and we are also i might add foreclosing the very real possibility that in the not too distant future the vast reserves of coal in the west can be used to generate the bulk of electric power as it does in other areas of the nation some fuels economists have predicted that by the year 1975 coal will generate a substantial block of electric power in southern california the nations railroads are at work now on plans for hauling this coal from the mines to the generating plants at a cost that will make coal competitive with other fuels there is talk about a coal pipeline utilizing the roadbeds of the railroads but if we let the public power zealots have their way on this hanford project i believe we will be opening the door to the complete domination of this huge power market by public power groups if these zealots of public power can win approval of hanford however disguised it might be in the face of two votes against it by this house then i say any public power project can win eventual approval as fast as we turn down individual projects to expand public power their supporters will bring them back in through the back door dressed up in new finery and get them approved if hanford can be built through indirection then that will become the accepted manner of dealing with public power projects i say to my colleagues who have voted on two occasions to kill this hanford project do not be fooled by all of this talk about an entirely new project and an entirely new approach you opposed the hanford project last year because it was wrong the hanford project is just as wrong today i urge you to vote for the substitute if you stick by the votes you cast last year we can bury this hanford project once and for all so deep that no group can dig it up i urge you to stick with the vote you cast last year vote against the hanford public

attainment and unselfish contributionthen age becomes a blessing a badge to be worn with pride as i said in my remarks to this house last september 27 when i commented on hadassahs outstanding 47th annual convention in denver i have never ceased to marvel at the singular lack of selfishness and the magnificent spirit of devotion to a cause which characterizes this organization hadassah the womans zionist organization was born in 1912 when a small group of women met in the vestry room of new yorks temple emanue1 they initiated what has become one of the most significant group efforts ever organized to carry out humanitarian principles the minutes of this 1912 meeting long since have disappeared but this much is known the assembly was called by henrietta szold an american jewess who had traveled extensively through palestine now israel this great lady had developed the idea of forming small groups of zionist women with the intention of sponsoring health projects in palestine the stated purpose of hadassah as recorded at the time was to promote jewish institutions and enterprises in palestine and to foster jewish ideals since that eventful meeting 50 years ago hadassah has enjoyed an incredible growth in membership and scope of activity it is now an integral part of virtually every american community all americans have every reason to be proud of hadassahs achievements both as a guardian of american democratic principles and as a vital instrument for bringing to the good people of israel and countries in africa and asia medical knowledge and techniques that are pertinent to advancing the health of men women and children there the more than 319 000 american women who belong to over 1 300 hadassah chapters throughout the united states have contributed through

underway at the time and we are sure the finished product is indescribable we hope to see it with our own eyes in the very near future in addition to the tremendous scientific achievements which will be made under the aegis of this medical center the ladies of hadassah have also made possible one of the most significant contributions ever made to the development of modern art the synagogue which has been built on the grounds of the center features 12 magnificent stained glass windows created by one of the geniuses of contemporary artmarc chagall these windows represent the best in contemporary technique and reflect the inspiration of religious faith it is not surprising that the ladies of hadassah should have been responsible for such a flawless merger of art and science for a vital part of their philosophy has always been that cultural contributions go hand in hand with scientific advancement it takes no small amount of determinationand capitalto create such an institution as the hadassahhebrew medical center the ladies of hadassah raised nearly 20 million for this facility which in total cost about 24 million this represents voluntary contributions on the part of the membership the ladies should be enthusiastically commended for their generosity and sense of purpose in this effort even though i am sure there was considerable sacrifice on their part but again it is axiomatic that any project of this organization should be carried out with devotion to the cause and little regard for the personal sacrifices which may have been involved this idealism has inspired the ladies of hadassah to exert every possible effort to bring israel the most modern medical care facilities educational opportunities and public health institutions and to assist in providing the means for a fullscale war against the scourges of disease and poverty which afflict the less fortunate nations of the world their zeal in these objectives is equaled only by their participation and

have been the advancement of principles of freedom and human rights and the promotion of greater human understanding their local activities include keeping its membership fully informed so they may be

conference report a number of excellent provisions which will do a great deal of good for small business and small business investment corporations which are growing like topsy and with jet speed as of the beginning of this year there were comparatively few of these small business investment corporations as of june 30 there were some 300 there was testimony before our subcommittee by the head of the sba that they expect there may be as many as 600 of these investment corporations by the end of this year it is a tremendously growing part of our business economy and the future potential is astounding in the framing of the house bill we had the cooperation not only of the staffs of the majority and of the minority but of the members of both sides and of the agency itself the small business administration and of the national association of small business investment corporations we worked together in framing an excellent bill by its provisions the house bill made it possible for the smaller corporations to become more profitable than they have been in the past it also spurred greater growth in this vital part of our business community it did so by inspiring the investment of greater amounts of private capital in them perhaps most important at the momentthe bill provided for enforcement powers to be placed in the hands of the small business administration these are necessary in this untried field which is growing so rapidly unfortunately in the course of the conference apparently the house conferees agreed to this provision of which you have heard from the gentleman from new jersey mr widnallj and the gentleman from texas this was a wellintentioned provision i am sure the intention was clear as the gentleman from texas has said to arrange so the funds could be reserved for smaller businesses unfortunately as is often the case with wellintentioned provisions it will create in my opinion four or five results which are most unfortunate in the first place it will deter the growth of these small business investment corporations at the very time when they are growing most rapidly and when they are becoming a vital part of our business community it may even seriously hamper those that are now in existence particularly when they bring new issues to the public for investment secondly it will brakeif not stop dead in its tracksa beneficial trend in this field toward more and more private investment this interest has reached new heights at this time and is growing daily this congress and the small business administration and the securities and exchange commission will hear a great deal more about private investment in this business unless this particular provision deters it as it may third this provision may mean that in order to keep stimulating this vital part of americas business community it will necessitate more government money and therefore an unnecessary drain on the treasury for there is in this act and in the previous one the potential of a tremendous amount of treasury money if it is necessary note i have said there may be as many as 600 of these investment corporations by the end of this year and they are still in their infancy as you have noted from the statement of the distinguished gentleman from texas the government is allowed to place into these corporations some 400 000 under section 302 and some 4 million under section 303 so just take the figure of 600 and multiply it by these figures and you will find that the potential governmental investment although probably it will not reach that amountand i certainly hope not it could be tremendous unless private capital is allowed to do the job we all want it to do lastly this provision may well hurt small business rather than help it the reason for this is obvious if or when those who wish to borrow more than 500 000 cannot do so under this provision they will have to go to other sources clearly other sources will be available only at much higher rates thus this provision may make it impossible for small businesses to have the investment capital they need to go ahead so i say to you that this is a crude attempt to do good and by such a crude attempt it may easily do bad it is unnecessary we already have the 20 percent limitation and the small business administration itself has the power to designate what is a small business the provision does not have the backing of the national association of small business investment corporations there was no testimony on this matter whatsoever either in the house or in the senate in adopting this the conferees have discouraged the possibility of a tremendous growth in the very near future in this vital part of our business community i am very hopeful that this provision will not do this because the remainder of the bill is good i sincerely hope that if in the next several months we find that it does do what i predict it will do we will have the support of the agency and of the national association of small business investment corporations yea even the majority members of the conferees of the house themselves in eliminating it for the future so doing would be in the best interest of small business"], [6.23464584350586e-05, 0.5000623464584351, 1, "this amendment goes to the very heart of what we are seeking to accomplish permit me to repeat here at the outset the essential provision of the amendment the congress in adopting this amendatory language would direct that our foreign assistance efforts be administered so as to place their prime emphasis uponand i read programs providing for loans or loan guarantees for use by institutions and organizations in making repayable lowinterest rate loans to individuals in friendly foreign countries for the purchase of small farms the purchase of homes the establishment equipment and strengthening of small independent business concerns acquisition of tools or equipment needed by individuals for carrying on a trade or financing the opportunity for individuals to obtain practical education in vocational and occupational skills i believe that this amendment expresses the prevailing sense of the congress concerning the proper and most effective direction for our foreign assistance programs this amendment addresses itself to and comes to grips with four of the most frequently voiced objections to the foreign aid program what do we hear when we hear thoughtful and constructive criticisms of the administration of the program first of all i think we hear that too much emphasis has been placed in the past upon outright grants rather than upon repayable loans i think it has been a valid criticism in some cases second i think we hear that foreign aid money sometimes has not filtered down to the average people in those countries we are trying to assist third i believe we hear that the program has not always actively encouraged free enterprise the individual ownership of farms homes and small businesses and finally i believe we hear that too much stress has been placed on some of the big grandiose projects that are too far removed from the lives of the average people to have much real grassroots impact to a greater or lesser extent i think we must concede that there has been some validity in each of these objections now the key words in this amendment are repayable lowinterest rate loans while these loans might be made available either through private american lending institutions or through local institutions and matching guarantees by local governments their object is not governments but individualspeople this might be called a grassroots approach i think it is a free enterprise approach if we are to develop viable economies in these friendly nations of the world that we are trying to help then those economies will have to be based on widespread individual ownership and individual opportunity that is what we have proven in the past 175 years as a nation what the individual citizenry in these friendly countries has needed is not a handoutbut a hand in many of these countries the great bottleneck to developing healthy economies has been the utter lack of any system of available credit to a private citizen at other than usuriously and unconscionably high interest rates this is perhaps the most basic of the reasons why these countries are underdeveloped and why they remain underdeveloped for countless generations in many of these lands a person born into a low and modest situation has been condemned to remain forever in those circumstances he has had no opportunity no hope of ever bettering his own economic condition of creating a more hopeful future for his children no hope for education no hope of ever actually owning a little house or having a few acres of his own no hope of ever purchasing even the most rudimentary agricultural equipment no hope of ever going into any sort of business for himself or of achieving in any degree any better status this naturally has produced unrest it creates dissatisfaction with the government it has spawned revolution after revolution this is the vacuum into which castro came where 90 percent of the people did not own 1 inch of real estate did not have one penny of equity and could not get a pennys worth of equity in any real property because they could not get any credit this is the vacuum into which castro came with his cruel promises and patented panaceas this is the cauldron of longsuppressed aspirations that the communists have exploited where the people can see no hope of ever achieving their legitimate aspirations through the slow and orderly processes of evolutionary government they turn in desperation to revolutionary means and this more often than not works against the interests of themselves as well as of the united states the way to save and strengthen democracy in the underdeveloped world is to show that these legitimate aspirations of the plain people can be achieved and better achieved through the processes of free government it is to show that a strong and viable national economy can be built and better built upon the rock of individual opportunity it is not good enough simply to tell them that communism is the wrong way let us show them that there is a right way for there is a right way to achieve their legitimate objectives of improving individual opportunity for the average people it is the way we have followed here in the united states let us show them the right way consider what was done by father dan mclellan in peru where he started what was regarded as a futile and hopeless project among the indians in the mountainous country near puno peru the natives had no money had no credit and could not buy or rent land could not afford to buy

distinguished commissioned officers of the public health service this man is dr g halsey hunt who is leaving the position of chief of the division of general medical sciences national institutes of health after 26 years of outstanding service to this nation i am very proud for the record to show that this man is a graduate of brown university providence r i during his 6year assignment to the national institutes of health dr hunt directed programs of great significance and impact on several of our more crucial medical problems in this country today these include research in aging research in the basic medical and biological sciences the improvement of clinical research throughout the nation and the development of improved mechanisms to aid the medical research activities of our private institutions the house is aware of my interest in the field of aging because of the measure we initiated to hold the white house conference on aging in january last year research is a very major part of our concerns with the problems of the aged and dr hunt in 1956 was the first director of the national institutes of health center of aging research in 1958 he was named the first chief of the newly established division of general medical sciences and the center for aging research was assigned as a component of that division in the past 4 years the extramural activities of the national institutes of health in research in aging have grown from 274 research projects at a level of 4 5 million in 1958 to nearly 900 throughout the nation at a level of approximately 30 million there is no question that these programs already have provided real help for the citizens and will make even greater contributions in the future the division of general medical sciences was established to help fill a gap area in our medical research effort that is the expansion and improvement of the roles of basic biomedical research and research training in the conquest of mans diseases fundamental research and research training in the medical and biological sciences are the necessary first steps in understanding man and his diseases and in devising those therapeutic measures which can help him recover from his diseases and keep him healthy the great import of these programs under dr hunts direction on the american biomedical community is evinced by the overwhelming demand of our medical scientists for grants that would enable them to conduct research and research training in the basic sciences this is apparent in the growth of the division from an appropriation level of 26 637 000 in 1958 to 122 million today it is very correct and significant that there have been introduced in both the house and the senate measures which would elevate the dgms to the status of an institute of the national institutes of healtha lasting tribute to dr hunts skill he also played a key role in the concept organization and initiation of two programs of highranking significance these are the clinical research centers program which is improving and intensifying the levels of clinical research throughout the nation and the general research support grant program which is a mechanism for great flexibility and effectiveness in providing grant funds to private institutions for the encouragement and improvement of our research and research training programs his versatility is illustrated by the fact that in 1945 after 9 years as a surgeon in the public health service he was brought into the public health service here in washington to carry out a study on group practice his administrative accomplishments in addition to those as a surgeon were such that he became assistant chief and then chief of the division of hospitals in 1947 and 1949 respectively and from 1952 to 1956 he was associate chief of the bureau of medical services and assistant surgeon general an example of a success in each of these assignments is illustrated for example by his skill in maintaining a high level of professional standards in public health service hospitals across the nation despite severe budgetary handicaps such a varied and distinguished career on the part of dr hunt obviously bespeaks character and competence of a truly remarkable nature on behalf of the american people i would like to thank him sincerely for his productivity proficiency and dedication to the health of the nation and i want to
