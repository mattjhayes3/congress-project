of this country to reverse the verdict which they have entered that reversal to take place in two elections one in 1894 and the otherin 1806 second it will permit the sheepgrowers of this country in the event it is determined that free wool shall obtain to dispose of their flocks and herds within a reasonable period and not force them all into the market at once thus reducing prices it has been asserted that under a freewool policy the price of wool will be raised and that under a tariff the price of wool has not been increased in this country i desire to state a few facts that are worth more to our people than all the theories that can emanate from all the freetrade brains in this house take my own state we are immediately south of and adjacent to canada an imaginary line separates the two countries the one from the other we have exactly the same kind of soil on the one side of that line as on the other we produce the same kind of nutritious grasses in montana that are produced in canada the sheep in montana drink at the same streams as the sheep in canada the same sun shines on the sheep in the one country as in the other now in 1892 the woolgrowers of montana received for their wool of exactly the same quality as that which was raised by their canadian brethren on the other side of the line from 15 to 23 cents a pound while just across the line the canadian woolgrower received from 10 to 12 cents a pound what was the reason for that exactly the same conditions of climate of food of quality of market entered into the problem yet the woolgrower on the one side of the line received from 15 to 23 cents per pound for his product and on the other side the farmer received from 10 to 12 cents what was the reason of it the reason was simply this that the protective tariff compelled the canadian farmer when he came to our line to put down his good 11 cents a pound for the privilege of coming into our market and selling his wool to our people that and nothing else was the cause let me go to another point i recollect distinctly that on the 27th day of last august the distinguished chairman of the committee on ways and means rose in his place upon this floor and told the house and the country that if we would only pass the wilson bill repealing the infamous purchasing clause of the sherman law prosp erity would again knock at every mans door the spindles would whirl again in every factory in the iand mines would be unsealed industry would stalk forth in all its manhood and labor would receive employment in every part of the land i wonder if that prophecy ever comes to disturb the dreams of the distinguished gentleman from west virginia i wonder if today when he predicts such beneficial results from the pending billthis second iniquity of which he is the fatheri wonder i say if he recollects the prophetic pictures that were so beautifully portrayed by him when he was urging dpon this house that very measure i wonder after all whether

pacific shore and seemed to be of the greatness of the far western world no more impressive personality ever moved about the halls of congressthan leland stanford of california the development of our western coastwas made by an order of men who although they were born and nurtured among us of the east yet took on a certain magnitude akin to grandeur in their presence which may have been derived from the vastness and tremendous scope of the deeds which they performed and their extraordinary natural surroundings some of them seem like the big trees which survive in their mountains when mr stanford came to the senate he was past middle age but still vigorous and in the prime of his menal powers his great wealth made him conspicuous in the minds of the people but to those who came in contact with him there was no evidence in his bearing that he was himself conscious of its possession i do not believe that he thought at all more highly of himself or valued other men the less on account of the possession or the want of money no man was ever so little changed in his own nature by its influence his soul was too large to be misled by any adventitious circumstance of life his mental powers were very great he was capable of grasping and of analyzing the most difficult problems that present themselves in human affairs and naturally dwelt upon those which concern the fundamental interests of humanity he was a great social philosopher and few men had so profoundly studied the questions which concern the general welfare of mankind he had read much but had thought more and he had a native strength which made the thinking of others to him of small importance what he concluded as the result of his own mental operations was likely to be rightone of those men who can go anywhere alone he knew intuitively the principles of things and would surprise you with wonderful flashes of light manifested in the simplest ways and on the mostfamiliar and commonplace occasions and in entire unconsciousness that what he was saying might be worthy of note his manner and forms of expression were brief and simple his words most fit and his meaning always clear he came to the senate full of the wisdom of experience in dealing with great affairs he was a lawyer a bsiness man a statesman a founder of one of our greatest commonwealths traveled cultured and accomplished one of the ripest and strongest men of action in that illustrious body he was specially interested in promoting the welfare of the common people any measurewhichproposed toincrease their happiness at once commanded his attention and support the laboring man had no wiser or truer friend and he gave himself to the advocacy of those lines of social and industrial reform which in his judgment combined conservatism with advancement in that wise proportion which is essential to healthy growth and real improvement in society he knew that the great processes of nature are mild and gradual as well as irresistible in their operation and that they are irresistible because they are mild and gradual he recognized the destructive power of the earthquake and of war but he did not mistake them for primary causes on the other hand he comprehended that they are but secondary being themselves consequences of the slow and silent pressure bf the eternal nature of things and but incidents in the long train of continuous action whereby the ages accomplish real transitions he had that largeness of view which comes from elevation and in a reverent sense with him one day was as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day so he contemplated the condition of men as revealed in history and as he observed it under his own eye and experience in this and in other lands guided by an acute moral sense and controlled by warm and generous sympathies the deductions of his intellect ripened into benevolent and comprehensive action for the good of man upon a scale which for magnitude and prospective consequences is unsurpassed if not unequaled by the practical work accomplished in the whole history of the race by any other individual uninspired man he clearly saw the possibilities in human nature and that we are yet in our infancy the great elemental forces seemed to be revealed to him and he comprehended what they could do with this mysterious creature compounded of the earth and the heavensof inanimate matter and the soul of god he knew not all that we can be but he saw that the possibilities are infinite and that in this state of being it is within the scope of reasonable effort to so far regenerate and transform and elevate the condition of man that in this life even there would indeed be a new heaven and a new earth his belief in the unseen and spiritual was rather in the nature of touch and vision than of deduction from reason in fact i think that our convictions of another life are weakened by speculation and philosophy if one does not believe what his mother told him and that rather because he feels it than because he can prove it he has no faith trained in early life to the rigid creeds of the forefathers he grew away from their harsher and nonessential features but never lost their essence which is the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man to those who knew him intimately mr stanford seemed to live in both worlds at once and to be perfectly at home in either so far as could be judged by one who could only associate with him in this but there was an advantage in his comprehension of the unseen for it enabled him to fashion his great plans with a view to that other and higher state which to him was the unseen only in the sense that it is yet to come and is rather a natural and necessary development than an abrupt translation to another and independent condition and by no means necessarily disconnected from future life on the planet which is our present sphere of activity in all his anticipations of good to come the enfranchisement and elevation of woman to her proper and equal position with man in everything which concerns absldute freedom of soul and body was a primary condition it is clear that he considered the mother of greater consequence in the evolution of a perfected race than the father for to the influence of heredity she adds that of nurture and control in those early years which fix character and determine

at least six times since i have occupied a seat in this body the whisky syndicate having insisted repeatedly that the bonded period should be extended from three to five or eight years the pending amendment of the gentleman from tennessee proposes to extend the bonded period from three years to eight years i desire simply to say that i am opposed to such extension three years during which the whisky is aging and during which the evaporation is going on at the expense of the government is a sufficient period to grant such a peculiar favor as this the proposition now to add 1ve years more to this bonded period is destructive to revenue it is practically a loan by the government to the whisky distillers for five years without interest we can safely leave the bonded period as it is now without any further privileges to this special interest and especially ought we to do this in view of the necessities of the government"], [0.00069427490234375, 0.5006942749023438, 1, "yes sir with

compliments he attempted to give expression to his affection when i first came here i loved him i when he was still but as i became better acquainted with him my affection increased rapidly and the opportunities for manifesting it were so very infrequent that i had to love him when he talked or i could not get a chance to love him at all he has not been as happy tonight as usual perhaps i ought not to say happy because he is always happy when he is talking but he was not as felicitious as usual the gentleman stated in the beginning that he had received a pile of information on this subject so high but that he had not read it his word is good here he need not have made his speech in order to satisfy us that he had not read the information received we would have accepted his statement as proof without the additional evidence afforded by his speech my friend says that he does not want to inflict this injury upon our horses why my dear friend if he will allow me to address him in that way we want antitoxine admitted free so that we can make the pauper horses of the old country bleed and thus save our own horses yet my friend would insist upon a tariff on this article would prevent the importation of the article from abroad and thus compel us to torture our own horses for the production of this medicine more than that the gentleman says there is a division among physicians on this subject that some think this preparation a good thing and some think otherwise now how shall we settle that question it must be done by experiment we want free antitoxine so that experiments may go on that there may be every possible opportunity to determine whether this is a good or a bad thing this bill is in the interest of the public health it is in the interest of those who want to cure this disease it may be that experiments will not bear out all the expectations that some people have in regard to this remedy but diphtheria is a dangerous disease and if there is anything mannfactured anywhere on the earth which we can import and by so doing save the lives of those who suffer with this dieaded disease i hope the gentleman from iowa will not make a humorous speech to prevent this relief being brought to the people of the united states the gentleman says he does not want the horses to bleed the welfare of the children of our country is more important than the protection of our horses even if we could protect the horses by opposing this bill the bill has been introduced in good faith when the gentleman asked me whether i could give an explanation of the manner in which this medicine was made i told him that i would not attempt it i am not prepared to do it but i wanted consideration for this bill so that the subject might be explained i shall call upon several expert witnesses i yield two minutes to the gentleman from south carolina a member of the medical profession in order that he may explain the use of this medicine"]]}
