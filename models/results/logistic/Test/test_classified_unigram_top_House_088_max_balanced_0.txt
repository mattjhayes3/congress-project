my colleagues in voicing concern over the serious matter of communists dumping shoes in the unitedstates market the impact of these imports on the american shoe industry requires an attentive and realistic consideration which seeks to get at the heart of the matter my own study of the situation raises the serious question as to whether those responsible for our trade policy are aware of the full implications of what they are doing it has been suggested by one of our more alert political humorists that a communist is a fellow who borrows your pot to cook your goose in i can perhaps understand why we might occasionally give in to the goodneighbor impulse and lend out our pot to an enemy but it escapes me entirely why having discovered our mistake on more than one occasion we insist not only on giving away the pot once again but in asking the fellow to turn up the heat yet this is precisely the problem we face in the shoe industry what worries me is the fact that what is happening to the american shoe industry today can happen to any other industry tomorrow i am worried too by the fact that our existing means of dealing with dumping by foreign countries and especially by communist nations is woefully inadequate and cumbersome the problem in a nutshell is this shoes from communist bloc countries are entering this country at an alarming rate and are being sold at prices clearly below the cost of production the impact of our own shoe manufacturers who are already beleaguered by fierce competition from italian japanese and other sources is most deleterious and working american men and women are being deprived of jobs and job opportunities because communist governments subsidize their own shoe manufacturing i see a great irony in our current trade relations with sovietbloc countries we seem to proceed on the false premise that economic relations with these satellites can take place in a political vacuum as if we were exchanging a friendly economic handshake with a good neighbor to the mutual advantage of both parties i wish that were the case the fact of the matter is that peace and friendship and good neighborliness do not characterize the policies of satellite nations we deal instead with men and policies whose major purpose is to undermine the power of this country while simultaneously strengthening their own position i suspect that few people realize the technique of trading with a communist country and how it differs from normal international commerce we deal not with individual manufacturers or jobbers but with a governmentcontrolled trade agency which works handinglove with the state planning organ which in turn determines the political as well as the economic advantage of trading with the west let there be no mistake about it trade policy like everything else the communist countries do is viewed as a coldwar weapon to be used in the same way as a gun and we all know where that gun is pointed the very nature of these statecontrolled economies gives a builtin ability to dump surplus products in foreign markets with the normal market barometer of the price system gone from the planned economy its production runs a wide cycle betwen deficit and surplus depending on how close the supposedly omniscient planner comes to predicting salable output if there is a surplus in any given accounting period it can be dumped on the most advantageous market at any price no matter how outrageously low and it should be noted there is no day of reckoning with the auditors no worries about meeting a payroll and no stockholders to face the monolithic state simply assumes the loss as a cost of doing business the socialist way there is another means by which such statedominated economies are capable of dumping they can plan to do so at the outset when they set their productive quotas for a given period so that a specified portion of the output is earmarked for purposes of undermining another countrys domestic market this ability provides the communists with a potent weapon for economic disruption and they have not hesitated to use it the shoes we see before us today are the result of one of two causes either socialist economic inefficiency hiding behind a wall of government assistance or calculated infliction of injury either way we are the suckers either way we get stuck either we are in the foolish position of sandbagging a communist countrys stupidity or we are freely handing over the proverbial pot and begging for the heat to be turned on we should however note that such predatory tactics can be perpetrated only so long as we foolishly insist on pursuing a policy which allows such goods to come into this country unrestricted and without regard to the impact of an important american industry what irony we have here this country spends billions annually to insure the freedom of the world against the ravages of communism and yet here our foreign trade policy is in effect giving open assistance to the very governmental policies whose goals we say we oppose above all the congress spends many millions of the taxpayers dollars annually to alleviate the unemployment problem this house is now weighing the merits of the socalled poverty program a substantial part of which is devoted to a supposed cure for unemployment yet at this very moment we sit back watching communist imports do the very damage to our shoe industry that our appropriations are attempting to stop the left hand taketh away what the right hand giveth many americans are vitally concerned with this problem it may be just shoes today but tomorrow it will be more shoes and more the day after that until the great long line in front of the unemployment office is shod entirely with communist shoes and then i suppose it will be something else perhaps steel and for all i am able to predict i suppose someday we will be buying weapons of national defense from communist countries when its too late well wonder how it all happened now is the time indeed to look closely at our communist trade policy"], [0.923255205154419, 0.923255205154419, 0, "i wish to say to my

was a vital need in all of the 50 states of our nation and voiced concern about the inadequacy of our plans to ready the youth of america for their roles in the aerospace age at thesame time i pointed out that a medium already existed for this task the unitedstates air forces aerospace education program for schoolteachersthrough its civilian auxiliary the civil air patrol with the assistance of its reserve component on all three occasions i documented this opinion by reporting the progress that had been made in our new jersey program now in december 1963 i am privileged again to report on this topic and i am happy to say that we can report impressive progress we have initiated a plan that couldon a national scalegive the tremendous acceleration needed to educate all of our people to the critical overtones of aerospace technology in my earlier reports the emphasis was one of national defense or survival this need has not in my opinion been altered by events since my last report but now perhaps another can be added one which might have a more tangible immediate significance for some i refer to our growing problem of the technically unqualified unemployed this problem can never be resolved solely by retraining programs for adults we must strike at the roots of the problemby reorienting our youth before they go out into their vocations in a free society such as ours science can advance only to the extent its free citizens may choose to follow that demanding discipline as their lifework authoritative studies indicate that creation of facilities is not the full answerthat it does not result in a production of interest among studentsand that a need exists for early motivation there can be little dispute today6 years after sputnik i first orbited the earththat a large pool of sciencetrained youth is necessary to our society it follows then that the desire for science study must be cultivated at an early age to be specific in the elementary and secondary grades of our formal education system it is my considered opinion that a broad program of aerospace education for elementary and secondary school teachers themselves is an essential primary phase toward this overall objective in the hope that a complete report on such a program will encourage others to quickly shake off their selfindulgent inertia and indifference i submit the following facts about the fourth year of this program in general the fourth inservice orientation workshop conducted for public school teachers in bergen county n j followed the format developed since 1959 its success was due in large measure to the continued sponsorship and support by the bergen county education association and the new jersey wing civil air patrol based on a study of past experiences the workshop committee decided to make several significant changes from the preceding projects the first was to provide instruction in actual classroom use of knowledge and materials made available by the workshop the committee also defined the program as essentially for teachers in grades 6 through 9 as in past years the workshop was comprised of 10 sessions starting on march 6 and closing on may 15 held again at the paramus high school in paramus n j these sessions included the following topics and guest speakers first session march 6 status of flight and space technology by mr hiram haggett education

undoubtedly the highlight of the entire program was the panel forum on the economics of flight to main street held on april 3 for this double session the teacherregistrants were joined by many business and civic leaders to serve as a grassroots reactor group in addition to preparing teachers to guide our youth toward their place in our highly technological society the bergen county workshop served a second function that of a sounding board for this newly conceived program for orienting the american public to the impact of aviation today unfortunately the full potential of this town hall forum was not realized because of inadequate planning and coordination in contrast the contributions of the nine panel members were outstanding mr oscar bakke assistant administrator eastern region federal aviation agency deserves a note of special praise during an aerial tour of the greater new york metropolitan area mr bakke gave an excellent inflight orientation talk to a 60man reactor panel

report the transition to specific classroom application mentioned earlier was implemented by dr harbeck and dr robert e krebs also of the unitedstates office of education during the past year two new activities were introducedboth in englewood n j it is fitting that englewood be the site for these pioneering efforts in aerospace educationas it was here at dwight morrow high school that comdr walter schirra one of our first astronauts went to school the first of these projects was an experiment in presenting aerospace education to an organized adult education group it served as a pilot operation in development of local and regional resourcesto augment the national agencies which have been supporting our programs in addition it provided the base for a detailed guide on workshop programs to adult school groups and to single school systems a third benefit was the initiation of active support from the new jersey department of educationwhich was to prove even more significant later in the year richard scheetz dean laux and william guthrieof that officeaided in the planning and the latter two volunteered as lecturers the second project in englewood was a concentrated program for more than 100 selected high school students with a guiding faculty committee under the able leadership of mr waldro kindig principal for a full week the first 2 study periods each morning were set asidefor a total of 10 lecture and discussion sessions this was a unique experience for both students and faculty it represented not only new educational content but also exposed them for the first time to new unfamiliar teaching methods under the general title my life in the aerospace age the facultystudent committee had established six major areas of interest the students were then polled for their preferencesand the top three were designated for implementation it is encouraging to note that these young people named government and communications along with the more glamorous

encouraging to report that practically all concerned regarded the project as informative thoughtprovoking and interesting and indicated an increase in their interest in aerospace matters before

widespread need of aerospace motivation and instruction for our professional educators at the same time they emphasize the critical shortage of qualified leadershipso essential for even the barest minimum attempt at the expansion to other parts of the state this brings us to the final part of my report the plans for this expansionand the need for aerospace education on a nationwide scale even while conducting these largescale centralized workshops our cap air reserve planning group has been wrestling with the problems of statewide expansion their solutions could well be adapted in other statesto accelerate the telling of the full story to every american citizen based on the experiences of the past 4 years our planners have reached several conclusions first while the orientationtype workshops are valuable there has been limited carryover directly into the classroomexcept where predigested materials were included in the workshop program secondly this is due to lack of time and specialized technical background needed for research by the individual teacher third the educational community has little capacity for organizing and implementing a program alined to a pressing current need of societyrather than to the measured advance of the education art as a whole these conclusions lead us to an entirely new concept that of developing instruction teams and workshop leaders at the local leveland to prepare and distribute complete teaching units ready for next day use in the classroom the instruction personnel will be obtained from both the education community and the cap air reserve the workshop leaders will be carefully selected from local teaching staffs when trained the latter group will organize aerospace education for the entire teaching staff of their respective school systems the instructor teams will be scheduled for presentations of specific subject matterunder the direction of these local leaders they will lecture at the afterschool training sessions and provide handout materials for classroom use by the teachers undergoing instructions upon completion of these phases the emphasis will shift instruction of supervisory personnel would followalong with continuous evaluation and upgrading of prepared materials and format with the rapid advance of aerospace technology this will be vital to keep the program current and meaningful obviously such a program requires an organization with the capacity to administer coordinate and operate it the new jersey wing civil air patrol offers the framework around which to develop such an organization the cap has the organization structure inbeingwith about 40 squadrons stationed convenient to practically all of new jerseys 300 local school districts bolstered by qualified air force reservists and educators they have the high degree of motivation and experience to contribute the continuity essential to the longrange success of the program under their basic aerospace education mission from the unitedstates air force they have already developed the personnel structure for functioning with the educators their groups and squadrons can act as the bases for coordination and scheduling within their immediate areasand for storage and distribution of teaching materials at the wing staff level they can coordinate the overall statewide programand maintain liaison with the national agencies and organizations involved in the national aerospace program an advisory committee has been formed to assist at this top level its function is to study and advise on matters involving basic policies broad direction and education technicalitiesand to apprise their respective groups on developments in the program invitations to participate have been accepted by major education organizations and distinguished leaders in education and aerospace affairs these include new jersey education association new jersey council of education new jersey secondary school

consumer everyone consumers and workers are vitally interested in the marketing or distributing processes by which goods are transferred from producers to consumers the retail store is the last and crucial stage of this marketing process before final consumption the retailer is actually the storekeeper for the community the history of retailing reveals that in some form goods have been distributed to meet human needs since the earliest beginnings the earliest written records and relics of commerce discovered in ancient ruins show the existence of both wholesale and retail trade the ancient cities of carthage athens alexandria and rome were trading centers that served not only their own population but also surrounding areas retailing in america had its beginning with the earliest trading posts which were the outgrowth of the activities of fur traders from these trading posts evolved the yankee peddler and the gen eral merchandise store the general store was one of the most interesting and significant factors contributing to american commercial growth it not only supplied a wide variety of merchandise but also constituted the social center for the men of the community here politics religion and personal problems were discussed public opinion of a large part of pioneer america was molded and crystallized in the general store and many important questions were ultimately settled there the retailers service to modern society is one that is too often taken for granted we are accustomed to receiving the benefits of our modern retailing institutions that we fail to realize what a vital and important part the retailer plays in the lives of each of us whenever there have been widespread railroad strikes the public is rudely awakened to its daily dependency upon this mode of transportation but if for example such a thing were to occur to all the retailers in this country the public would realize how much more dependent upon retailers we are for the fulfillment of our daily needs for instance when a man wants a suit of clothes he is not likely to know of a factory making mens clothing if he does not locate one he does not know whether it will sell him one at the price he is willing to pay or whether the suits made there are in the styles he likes he also lacks a knowledge of the various kinds of cloth does not know his measurements and so on all of these details are handled by the retail clothing merchant who is a specialist in his field rendering a complete service to his customersa service which in the case of buying a suit of clothes need not take more than a haf an hour the same could be said for all consumer and industrial products handled by retailers the independent retail stores of the nation serving millions of americans across this continent have often been referred to as the cradle of the american business system it is here that our production knowhow our distribution methods and our ideas culminate in better products for less money retailing and the american free enterprise system go handinhand the major types of retail institutions today include independent stores department stores mailorder houses chain stores cooperative chains supermarkets discount houses to mention a few competition among these institutions for the customers dollar is fierce and the customer is benefiting as a result prices are being held down wider selections and better quality goods are being made available store decor has been improved selfservice from more attractive merchandise displays has made shopping faster and easier parking facilities are more readily accessible and more convenient shopping hours enable the family to shop together all of this has been done in the spirit of free enterprise it is only when we try to visualize a world without the independent and enterprising retailer that we realize how much he does for us and how dependent we are upon him in our daily life"],

to be associated with the committee on science and astronautics in support of the pending legislation i have been a member of this house for many years as you all know and i can vouch for the thorough and careful consideration given this bill i am very happy to be a member of this committee one of the real pleasures of my long legislative service is my association with this committee i never saw a better committee a more diligent a more dedicated committee than is the present committee on science and astronautics in the past i have been accustomed to being forced to drum up quorums that is not the case with this committee the committee is ready to start the minute the gavel of the chairman falls that is a stimulation to me and most encouraging i have also noticed that the members of this committee dig very deeply into their subjects they know their subject thoroughly and they come prepared to answer questions nor do they take things for granted they must be shown and vigorously question the witnesses so i am glad to be associated with this bill it is a good bill not all that everyone wants but on the whole it is a progressive piece of legislation one that will insure that america will maintain its place in the battle for control of space we are very fortunate in having the gentleman from california as chairman of this committee he is not a bitter partisan which is another thing i like about the committee it is not a partisan committee they give equal treatment to all no matter what party may be involved the decisions are fair and impartial the gentleman from california has always been fair and generous and he is a good leader i also want to congratulate the acting minority leader of the committee i call him such although he really does much of the work for which i get the credit i refer to the gentleman from pennsylvania he is a dedicated student of this subject and we are very fortunate on the republican side to have such a man as a member of the committee there will probably be some criticism one of which comes to my mind at the moment involving the location of a research laboratory this emphasizes the fairness of the committee the bill does not bar a single community in the country from presenting whatever claims it desires we gave everybody what i consider is a fair chance so i think this is a wellroundedout bill it gives everybody a chance on merit and without political pull i know this is a lot of money and i know what money is because i started at the bottom and fought my own way up i have had to work my way from boyhood and i know the value of money i would not spend it unless i believed it was a good gamble when you get into this space effort of course you are making a gamble i do not know how much money is going to be needed for this this may not be enough however i know it will keep everything moving properly and i know that we will not lose out some people complain because we are not military minded enough in this legislature i am not a military man i want civilian life to have the full benefits of anything that comes out of this and i know that the military will not be neglected because as this program unfolds its advantages we do not want to sacrifice anything and we want all to benefit military as well as civilianthe united states and all of its people i am not worried over that i am worried more over what the country and the world might think if we fail to pass this measure this battle has been faced and it is still going on the only question is are we going to keep america up where it belongs in that fight i recall some of our committee members saying that we were up in orbit because we recommended an extremely large sum well my friends they called the wright brothers a couple of nuts but that did not stop them they went on with what they had to do they followed through and america won the first world war in large measure through the development of the airplane so how do we know what is going to develop from the space bill i am supporting the bill because i am an american i am supporting it because i believe it is to the interest of my country as a matter of fact i do not think the question is whether we should pass this bill or not i think the question that a man must answer to himself is can i afford not to pass it can i afford not to give the administration a chance to keep the american flag up in the forefront such little things as where a few people or a few installations are placed are after all minor things they will be evaporated in the space of time i will be frank enough to say that i hope that this survey which they are going to make of this installation will be supported by the scientists and they will agree it should be in new england however i would not want it there if it were not for the benefit of the whole country that is what we are looking for the fact that they have to do this all over again make another recommendation and then come back to the congress is another point that is come back to the congress instead of to the committee you are not going to find anyone who knows more about this subject than the science and astronautics committee that is the committee to which it should come back because it knows what it is all about and can make a proper proposal so let us pass this bill as it is perhaps not as it is because there may be some amendments to cor rect it but the point is to pass the bill a proper space bill and keep the american flag up front"], [0.00016772747039794922, 0.500167727470398, 0, "i

american president of courage and devotion to the duties of that office who with his selfappointed tasks likewise unfinished was also taken away from us nearly a century ago within the fortnight columnist james reston writing in the new york times had commented on the late presidents failure to move key portions of his legislative program through this congress and had speculated that this might be so because hepresident kennedyhas touched the intellect of the country but not its heart perhaps if one were to confine himself to political programs and policies this was true however the spontaneous and obviously sincere outpouring of national grief that marked the shocking and senseless killing of john f kennedy the president has seemed to demonstrate beyond all doubt that the people of the united states have now taken john f kennedy the man to their hearts one could and did differ with president kennedyas i and many another here have on occasionbut one could not do so without an appreciation of his tolerance of honest differences over means his patience in the midst of adversity the breadth of his intellect and the keenness of his wit and of course the encompassing warmth and

woods are lovely dark and deep but i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep and miles to go before i sleep some observers have thought to explain this presidential choice as indicative

presidency which in his own words he regarded as the wellspring of action in the american constitutional system to such a man the reluctance of this and the previous congress to adopt his programs and

it would be impossible for any committee to present a money bill designed to increase revenue of the government without hearing a lot of squawks as i mentioned during the general debate the balance of this fee schedule has been carefully considered by the judiciary committee and every point of view and every argument has been taken into account as i mentioned a moment ago the committee was unanimous on this fee schedule with perhaps one exception and in the view that if we are to put the patent office on anywhere near a selfsustaining basis the fees must be increased all we do under this proposed fee schedule would be to put it on a 75 percent of selfsustaining basis there was a time when it was 90 percent selfsustaining it is supposed to be 100 percent selfsustaining in order to put the patent office on a 75 percent selfsustaining basis it has been necessary to make some adjustments in the fee schedule in effect at the patent office the attack now is on the maintenance fee i assure the gentleman from illinois who i believe is in favor of the government being on a payasyougo basis and in favor of economy in governmentif we removed the maintenance fee we would have no other choice than to raise the initial fees either that or we permit the office to run at the giant deficit it is now maintaining every year to the extent of 70 percent of the cost the appropriations committees of the house and senate must come up with the dollars at the taxpayers expense to carry this load if the filing and issuing fees should go up which they must if we knock out the maintenance fee who would be hurt it would be the little man the little inventor the individual man or small fellow trying to test a new patent because these fees are immediately payable whether or not the patent has earned a dime that is the only alternative we would have otherwise we would have to leave it as it is in complete derogation of title v of the united states code which specifically says that agencies of this kind providing services of this kind must be on a selfsustaining basis let us have a clear understanding of the maintenance fee when we talk of the maintenance fee we are talking ultimately about nearly 50 percent of the new revenue twelve million dollars of new revenue would be provided when all fees are in effect it is estimated that eventually almost half of this will come from maintenance fees the maintenance fee is a fee to help pay the high cost of keeping patents on file in the patent office after 5 years have gone by there is to be a charge of 50 for carrying that patent in the office after the 9th year a charge of 100 and after the 13th year a charge of 150 the maximum life of a patent is 17 years any inventor who has not produced income from that patent would have a right to ask for deferment he could ask for deferment of the first 50 fee and he could ask for deferment of the next 100 after the ninth year and the deferment would run for a total of 13 years is it not reasonable that if after 13 years have gone by the patent has proved to be so worthless that it has produced no income at all the man should be given an opportunity then to drop the whole thing or be asked to pay a fee if he still wants to hold the patent monopoly if he elects to let the patent lapse no maintenance fee would be charged and the patent would then lapse the patent would end automatically in any event 4 years later at the expiration of 17 years i do not know of anything more reasonable than that i should like to reiterate the point made earlier the objection to the maintenance fee does not come from the little man or from the new or young inventor the objection comes from the bg corporations which have a whole stable full of salaried inventors who flood the patent office with patent applications which they have no present intention of using which will not be developed which will not be put to constructive use and which will continue to be held as a
