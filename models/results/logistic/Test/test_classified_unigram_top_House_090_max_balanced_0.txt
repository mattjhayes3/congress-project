of the crusade for civil rights these years were echoed and summed up in senator kennedys last campaign with its great concern for righting wrong and healing suffering expressed in the style and rhetoric of a great movement for change in his career as senator robert kennedy was in the forefront of the causes so prominent in the public consciousness the causes of the poor the hungry the forgottenthe negro slumdweller the american indian the mexicanamerican he spoke in the tones of the activist with that mans outstanding trait of commitment a great passion demanding dramatic action this is a dangerous trait capable of doing great harm but of doing great good also and in the work of senator kennedy it produced immeasurable good his deep and evident shock at the dreary life of the slum and the reservation won him the trust of the indian mexican and negro he won the unquestioning devotion of many who thought they could never believe a white person and he hoped and planned to turn this trust to the benefit of his country among his last public words were i think we can end the divisions within the united states the violence when senator kennedy took the forefront of the cause of civil rights he marched in the van of a fundamentally legal crusade he was part of a great movement sprung from an act of law the granting of citizenship to the african slave this act of emancipation is celebrated in the great negro holiday the juneteenth the 19th of junewe saw this day celebrated last week in the solidarity day march the act of emancipation wrought a momentous change in our constitutional and legal life which still preoccupies us 100 years later and which preoccupied robert kennedy throughout his national career as attorney general he presided over the final granting of legal citizenship to the descendants of the emancipated slaves and like last weeks march which for all its radical decoration commemorated an act of law senator kennedys last campaign which some found so frightening in its appeal to the oppressed was fundamentally based on his concern for law he pursued injustice as a young investigator for senate committee hearings he enforced law as attorney general and as senator he sought to make the law just he was a white person who could lecture on law and order in wattsand be listened to he was a man capable of showing the country that its divisions could be bridged by law if only the law transcended the divisions if one law applied to black and white then black and white would submit to the law robert kennedys most permanent record is written in the law in the laws he enforced and the laws he helped write like his funeral procession any tribute to his memory must pause at the justice department and the campsite of the nations poor but robert kennedy had a wider constituency including as many groups and interests as the polyglot city and state of new york if not the entire nationwide range of his mourners he was a leader in the great tradition inherited from medieval nobility almost as if the family abided by the medieval law of primogeniture he assumed the burden and glory of his family responsibility on the death of his brother president kennedy just as his brother had taken up the political career planned for his first born joseph he was a wealthy man who cared about the poor a famous man who mingled with the obscure a proud man who respected the humble and a shy man who stood before the many he aroused the deep and irrational loyalty peculiar to feudal life during life he won a special place in the hearts of many which the manner of his death has made firm and enduring in the hearts of the whole country i know no more fitting expression of this subtle and delicate emotion than the quotation from shakespeare with which robert kennedy eulogized his older brother at the democratic convention at atlantic city when he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun and as for us his mourners who have for 5 years now seen so many heavy blows delivered to the fabric of our political life perhaps it is fitting to remember another quotation from aeschylus delivered by senator kennedy on the death of martin luther king jr even in our sleep pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until in our despair against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace of god under unanimous consent i include in the record at this point the following editorials which appeared in my district as an eloquent example of the feelings of this nation toward the late senator robert kennedy he dared robert f kennedy died at the hands of an assassin before he had a chance to prove his ability to win the presidency and his ability to govern a nation but he did not die before he had proven his ability as a man we can never know how this dynamic young man would have influenced his world we do know he would have tried to change things as they are and perhaps that is why he is dead those who would challenge the sickness of society the darkness of the status quo must always be targets of those who undeserved prerogatives are threatened senator kennedy as his brother before him was willing to make the challenge and accepted the risk must it be ever thus must it always be that the gallant and daring die young before they can achieve their goals perhaps not hopefully not because there must always be those with the courage to lead us out of the darkness into light there must always be kennedys lincolns kings and others who have suffered martyrdom for the sake of mankind senator kennedy will not witness the changes he had dared urge but many will come about because others will continue to challenge continue to dare he has left us a legacy of courage which we as a nation are honor bound to carry on from the holyoke mass daily telegram

when this can be done without undue hardship to the employers business the burden of proving that accommodation to the employees needs would be unreasonable would rest on the employer revision of the guidelines became necessary because of numerous questions regarding the possibility of religious discrimination in cases where employers discharge or refuse to hire employees who observe friday evening and saturday or some other day as the sabbath or who observe certain special religious holidays during the year and therefore do not work on such days the new regulations seem eminently reasonable and fair both to the employer and the employee it assures the employer that his business will not suffer because of the special hours his worker must spend in the observance of his religious obligations and it assures the employee or job applicant that his religious beliefs need not be a bar to employment religious freedom is among the major cornerstones of our national heritage

another increase in taxes threatened it is a limited war to gain limited objectives but it is a war with which americans are growing increasingly impatient and frustrated because of its seeming endlessness its enormous cost and its tragic human consequences the time has come when we must ask whether we are following the best road towards peace i would question today whether everything possible is being done to seek settlement of the war i suggest that there is available to us a more promising road towards peace than any of the paths which the administration or certain hawks or doves would have us follow i propose today as a plan for peace in vietnam that this nation initiate a policy of mutual stepbystep deescalation with hanoi the outlines of one variation of this policy are these the united states having proposed the plan to hanoi through private diplomatic channels would halt all bombing north of the 21st parallel in north vietnam for 60 days if within the first 60day standby period the north vietnamese had taken no such step the plan would end and the bombing would be resumed the united states would gradually in five successive steps cease all bombing of north vietnam if after each 60day step the north vietnamese took a similar deescalation step the measurable and equivalent deescalation steps which the north vietnamese could take without putting themselves at a distinct military disadvantage would include the stopping of all terrorist activitier in specific areas of south vietnam the stopping of shipments to and from specific military supply depots in the southern part of north vietnam the barricading and abandonment of specific supply and infiltration routes along the ho chi minh trail and the withdrawal of mig fighters to distant bases in northern north vietnam i suggest that this proposal for a policy of mutual stepbystep deescalation is both positive and practical it enhances the chances for peace through negotiations in a limited war and it minimizes military risks it avoids the danger of the course advocated by those hawks who would escalate the war because it obviously does not risk expansion of the limited war to total war it avoids the dangers of the naive course advocated by those doves who would unilaterally cease fire and retreat from the countryside because it does not risk significant erosion of our current military advantage in vietnam netiher side would be placed at a distinct military disadvantage because both sides would be required to mutually deescalate i suggest that this stepbystep deescalation plan would induce an increasing atmosphere of trusta necessary prerequisite to meaningful negotiations it is a series of small steps each involving relatively little military risk and each of which builds confidence in the genuine sincerity of each of the combatants the plan would not ask either side to lose face it is a plan which gives each side the opportunity to claim justiflably that its initiative promoted peace and served its national objectives i cannot guarantee that this policy of mutual stepbystep deescalation will bring peace but i do believe strongly that it holds tremendous promise i do believe that it holds far greater promise of peace than either the administrations standpat policy or the alternatives suggested by either the hawks or the doves i would urge today most sincerely that the president immediately examine in good faith this plan for peace in vietnam through initiation by the united states of a policy of mutual stepbystep deescalation for such a plan i am confident could move us forward to fruitful negotiation and peace it is time now to become more aggressive in our search for peaceful settlement through negotiations it is time now to persuade the administration to pursue peace through negotiations with the same intensity that our valiant fighting men resist aggression but it is not time now or ever to suggest as some have done that without any indication of good faith from the communists we should unilaterally cease fire throughout vietnam and hope the communists do the same firing only if fired upon these same critics suggest that we abandon the policy of searching out and destroying communist forces in south vietnam they suggest that we retreat in vietnam shoring ourselves up in what are described as easily defensible positions and sallying out perhaps from time to time to protect the perimeter from mortar fire i would argue that these critics show their naive misunderstanding of world affairs i suggest to you that theirs is a call for retreat from reason in effect they ask that the united states and south vietnamese forces cease fire abandon the countryside and the peasants to the communists and retreat to the more easily defended cities i submit to you that such suggestionsmade in the name of promoting peaceare utterly unrealistic when we face the hard cold facts something that proponents of these suggestions are either unwilling or unable to do to follow such suggestions at present would be to deal a devastating blow to the chances of achieving a lasting world peace to follow such suggestions at present would be tantamount to surrender and withdrawal of unitedstates forces from vietnama tragic defeat for the free world those who make such suggestions at times appear as if they believe they alone seek peace they have no monopoly on peace their path is not the only road and certainly not the best road towards peace let us not forget the lesson of munichhow hitler grabbed the rhineland austria and czechoslovakia let us not forget that to yield to aggression today is to invite wider wars tomorrow there is an important role to be played today by informed critics willing to face facts and shed any naive dreams about the state of the world a constructive critic might reasonably ask as i have today whether everything possible is being done to seek settlement of the war short of total military victory are efforts really being made to reveal our limited objectives by the offering of new political and military inducements a constructive critic today might reasonably ask how the administration can justify the escalation of recent months when it rejected that same escalation 2 years ago as being out of bounds a constructive critic today might reasonably ask whether the administration has given good faith consideration to proposals such as those for an allasian peace conference a constructive critic today might reasonably ask why the american people long ago were not leveled with and told frankly of the long range implications of this conflictwhy they were led down the primrose path and given only small doses of bad news in sugarcoated pills but no reasonable critic willing to face the hard cold facts would naively insist that this is a civil war or call on the united states and south vietnamese forces to abandon the countryside and peasants to communist terror and subversion it makes far more sense to pursue peace by immediately initiating a policy of mutual stepbystep deescalation"], [0.0003159046173095703, 0.5003159046173096, 0, "i am pleased to have the
