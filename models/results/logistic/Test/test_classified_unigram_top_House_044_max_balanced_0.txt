which were assumed by the distinguished gentleman froni new york who spoke so eloquently oi this subject the olhr day are to be taken for granted as true then there can be no doubt at all but the mind of every miumher of this committee will gratefully and cordially follow the lead of those two gentlemen i say if the premises upon which they started out in discussing this bill in the committee are true then there is no difficulty in reaching the same conclusion they did they started out with the declaration that the object of the bill which the committee has now under consideration is to declare war against the indian tribes and nations is that true is that position verified by the recitals in the sections of the bill can we say such is its object and purpose i am happy to say to this committee that in the investigation of this ouatter the committoo on indian affairs entered into it in no partisan spirit they entered upon it with a desire primarily and with the main and prominent object of giving protection to the indian and carrying out the treaty obligations of our government now this has been a question which has vexed the minds of statesmen from the first foundation of the government the indian has been a subject of anxious consideration he has been swept on to the west by the tide of civilization from the east and now two tidalwaves one flowing from the atlantic and the other from the pacific slope meet him upon the western border and there are no longer any happy huntinggrounds farther west to which lie can be pressed this committee sir has had no desire or wioh to violate one single treaty obligation of the government and in the conclusion to which the majority have arrived they have been animated i say primarily by the consideration of the indians welfare they find new the indian is confined to indian territory under treaties made with the gvcrinent and they have no disposition toviolate those treaties when they yielded the vast possessions we now enjoy and under the treaties made by former administrations retired to the west they were assured by that man of iron will and comprehensive mind who then presided over the destinies of this country general jackson vhen this territory was assigned them that it should be theirs and their childrens and their childrens children in perpetuity forever using the beantifnl and figurative language so well calculated to strike the indian mind and impress him with the conviction that the white nman did not speak with a forked tongue he said to them this territory shall be yours while the rivers flow and the oaks grow and there is no disposition on the part of the american congress to violate one single obligation assumed either in the ancient treaties with this race or in the modern treaties but on the contrary we desire to carry out in good faith everypledgo of our government but it was a question as to what was the most expedient mode of carrying out in good faith the treaties of the government and of the american people with this race i wish to say however that the comamittee in investigating this question have been animated by this desire primarily hut they have not forgotten what the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from massachusetts seem to have forgotten that we have a people upon our own frontier immediately and directly in communication with the uncivilized indian tribes whose property whose houses and lives are seriously jeopardized by contact with uncivilized indian tribes they seem to have forgotten we have another people of our own to guard and protect they seem to have forgotten the conventions and treaties between the indian nations of this country like all treaties and conventions impose oblifations upon both parties entering into them to observe their stipuyou would not have supposed in listening to the eloquent speech of my distinguished friend from new york or that of the gentleman from massachusetts there had ever been a single act of indian barbarity or indian outrage perpetrated during the whole history of the government you would have supposed on the contrary tit the only men guilty of wrong the only men who had infracted these treaties the only men who lad broken their words and disturbed the plighted faith of our nation were the officers and soldiers of ourarmy it was said by the distinguished gentleman from new york in the progress of his speech that men upon the border could not understand this question that they might think it a little singular that a gentleman from the great metropolitan district of new york should undertake to determine this idian question better than the men who live upon the border sir i was very much reminded as the gentleman dwelt upon this idea and inculcated this opinion of a description given by dielcens of the wonderfully charitable woman who was knitting socks and making garments for the children of the people of timbuetoo island while her own ehildren were unshod and unprovided for she looked from a distance as my distinguished friend from new york does on this question and he thinks he nuderstands it better than the long array of witnesses we have examined by our committee who have lived more than a quarter of a century in that territory in daily contact with the indian was it really an unjust thing to suppose that these men thus examined by this coalmiitee in the spirit and in the temper in which they wore examined did not understand the subject as well as my distinguished friend from the metropolitan district of new york or as well as the gentleman from the state of massachusetts we had no partisan object to accomplish we had no consideration for the army in determining this question as the majority of the committee have determined it we looked alone first to the rights the indian had and to our duty for his protection and secondly to the equ ally just rights which under the treaties we were bound to observe to our own people of the caucasian race it was said by the distinguished gen tleman from new york in the progress of his remarks that he himself had witnessed the wonderful effects of the civilizationwhieh had been produced by thearmy and he had previously said accounting for his own interest in this matter and his understanding of the subject that he was himself from a distinguished tribe the tammany tribe in the state of new york but that he had not derived his information from that tribe or its history and i suppose lie bad not for if i read the history of the country aright i think it is written that the chief of that tribe departed souse time ago from the island of manhattan taking all the wigwams and almost all the property of the tribe along with him i suppose that my distinguished friend from the state of new york who seems to think that there is so nmch to be feared from the army when he stood upou the top of that lofty mountain dafrique anti looked upon the wondrons spectacle of the civilization of the kabyles guarded by five hundred french soldiers in the french uniform but whom my friend from new york would have denominated wolves in the french uniformi suppose when he stood upon this lofty mountain and witnessed this spectacle and congratulated himself on the progress of civilization he had forgotten the fact that he admitted the five hundred soldiers were there for the purpose of protecting and guarding that civilization and indeed the admission was made that they were the authors and means by which it was produced but still the five hundred soldiers were necessary to perpetuate and keep alive this civilization i thought that some of the ancient blood of the tribe to which the gentleman belonged must have stirred his veins when ho stood on this mountain for he grew so savage in his temper that lie wea not willing to be interrupted by a courteous remark from my distinguished friend general spanks who has charge of this bill the gentleman from new york further stated in the course of his speech that it was necessary the army should be strengthened and that the indian forts should be strengthened afterward he seemed to argue it was unnecessary to have any army at all is that the opinion of the distinguished gentleman from new york and does the gentleman from massachusetts agree with him do they think now that in our indian territory there is noarmy why in the indian territory itself where we have five civilized tribesthe cherokees chickasaws choctaws creeks and seminoleswe have troops even there though this bill does not propose by transferring to the war department the conduct of indian affairs to interfere in the slightest degree with any one of these civilized tribes the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts and his colleague upon this question from new york have alluded to the halfbreeds of the indian nation as constituting evidences of reproach to these people permit me to say to the gentleman from new york and to the gentleman from massachusetts that the most intelligent gentlemen whom we had before us of that tribe were of this class and that they advocated the idea that the chief sources of civilization were to be found in contact with and intermarriage with the anglosaxon race and during this session of congress and before this committee we have lead halfbreeds of the various tribes some from the cherokee nation and some from others who constituted the most intelligent and the ruling portion indeed of these various civilized tribes they were here to speak for themselves they were here to say that that civilization with which the tribes had been blessed was attributable to contact with the white men now i say that in this indian territory we have at port vincent soldiers of the army and officers of the army and nobody proposes to take them away we have also at fort sill and camp supply officers of the army and soldiers of the army they are scattered all over your western frontier they are necessary there for two pirposes to see that the rights of the indians are protected and to see that the rights of the white men living upon our frontier are guarded and protected do i understand that the gentlemen who opposed this bill and who opposed the views of the majority of the committee agree with the idea that ave no longer need any troops there at all such certainly is not the sentiment of the distinguished gentleman from new york in the speech which he made the other day but on the contrary he seems to be of opinion that it is absolutely necessary that these forts should be kept up and the army increased for in the progress of his wellconsidered and able speech elaborately pondered over not uttered on the impulse of the moment but considerately lie says i agree with the gentleman from texas that the lio g rade needs protection and that the forts need manning in the indian country a little further along on the same page he says we want no standing army either for the south or the frontier so that we see here an admission that the army is necessary and yet upon the proposition to transfer the indian bureau to the war department the gentleman says that no army is necessary either upon the border where we have savage tribes or in the indian territory this bill sir does not propose to affect at all the five civilized iribes this government however has always kept soldiers there during the progress of this civilization for what purpose and when have they acteil f it is said by the gentleman from massachusetts that they have occasionally acted improperly world you therefore hold the whole army responsible on thit account it was said by the distinguished gentleman from new york that yon should not trust the army because of the improper conduct of some one officer and he alluded especially to the action of general sheridan in the city of new orleans in january 1875 when he was sent there for certain purposes he alluded to a memoralle historical dispatch which was sent by general sheridan to the secretary of war proposing that he should be invested with power to establish military commissions and to try phose parties alleged to have been guilty of offenses whom he declared were banditti and the gentleman alluded also to the response of the secretary of war to that message that response is yet fresh in the memory of ourwholepeople the president and all of us approve the course you pursue now i say that while these instances of military assumption of authority may here and there exist and while there may occasionally occur in our history instances in which military men have acted without authority and have exceeded their just powers and even stained with dishonor the epaulets on their shouldersxand the uniforms they wore there have also been instances yet fresh in the memory of the country in which officers of the army have preserved and observed all the rights and privileges which belong to the citizens of the country under the constitution and laws of the country made subject to their control if the gentleman had looked a little further back in the history of army officers at new orleans he might have found that in 1867 two years after the war closed a distinguished general of the army general hancock who was assigned to the command of the fifth military district when governor pease of the state of texas asked of him that he should supersede by his own military order the great body of the common law that existed in texas and that he should wipe out by one dash of his pen the great body of civil laws that prevailed in the state of louisiana his reply is yet fresh in the memory of the people in order to show that there are officers of the army who understand something of the constitttiou and the rights of the people under it i quote his reply to this demand of governor pease who was probably a legitimate cousin of kellogg of louisiana and ames of mississippi the latter of whom has just gone back to the region of country from which he came and we think for our countrys good in answer he said solemnlyimpressd with theseviews th general announces that the great prin ciples of american liberty are still the lawful inheritance of this people and over soeuld be the right of trial by jury the habeas corpus the liberty of the press tile freedom of sapech the natral rilghta of persons and the rights of property must be preserves so i say sir that we cannot single out one instance of assumption of authority either in indian wars or elsewhere by the military and then say that we cannot trust the officers of the army and the men of the army on that account in this instance a proposition is madeto do what to use the army for the purpose of making wax upon the indians not at all but the result shows when you ook at the past management of indian affairs nder tie war department that the expenditures have increased since it was transferred in 1849 from the war department to the interior department then created the expenditures for the indians then numbering four hundred thousand were only 900 000 per annuml not quitea million what dowe see now and the statement of these results is an answer to the argument of the gentleman from massachusetts and all the details of his argument may be answered satisfactorily by other details that can le produced the expenses for the indian service have been on the increase from year to year until they have swollen up during the last fiscal year and probably during the present fiscal year to from 5 000 000 to 8 000 000 and what has been the number of indians in 1849 they numbered as i have said more than four hundred thousand according to the census now they are said not to embrace more than three hundred thousand including both the savage and the civilized tribes it appears therefore that the expense of the administration of this indian service under the peace management which has been alluded to by the gentleman from massachusetts has increased from 900 000 to nearly 8 000 000 per annum while at the same time the number of indians has decreased nearly one hundred thousand why is this so i say it is sufficient evidence of tile fact that there has not been that just and economical administration of the department to which the government is entitled now where does the fault lie and can it be remedied it is said by gentlemen that you must remedy this trouble by getting holiest agents that you have mot tried this peace arrangementlong enough why sir you have tried it since 1849 and have seen its operation dring all these years you have seen the expenses of this department gradually increasing from year to year until now they have swollen to the enormous amount 1 have just named i say this is sufficient evidence of the fact that there has not been an economical administration of indian affairs why is it that we hear complaints from every indian tribe that their annuities are not distributed to them that their supplies are not carried to them your committee took a large amount of testimony on the question of the ecoumy of the transfer of the indian bureau to the war department it is not proposed in so transferring it that we shall banish from the indian territories or indian tribes all civilization and christianity the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts has said that uder the peace arrangement the indians have advanced wonderfully in civilization and christianity who is it that proposes because the indians asi transferred to the war department and that department given the power to purchase these supplies to make the payments of the annuities to administer all the indian affairs by officers of the armywho proposes to take from the indians the teacher who goes among them to instrnet them in christianity and civilization is it to be presumed that because this transfer is made therefore all effort to civilize and christianize the indians is to be dispensed with this very peace commission upon which the distinguished gentlemen from now york and massachusetts predicated their remarks return their thanks to the officers of the army for the extraordinary kindness and courtesy they received at their hands when they went there fur the purpose of investigating the cpndition of the indians my friend from massachusetts when ho read what was said by the peace commission in 1868 forgot to read the concluding portion of their report in which they recommend that this transfer to the war department shall be made it will be observed that the very basis of the speeches of the gentlemen from now york and massachusetts is the fact that this peace commission in 1868 was opposed to this transfer let mccall the attention of the gentlemen very briefly to what that peace commission said mark you this is the peace commission sent out for the purpose of ascertaining how the affairs of the indians had been managed that commission says that there are bad men connected with the service cannotbe dented the records art ahandant to show that afents have pocketed the funds appropriated by the government and driven the fndians to starvation doesthe gentleman from massachusetts believe that part of the report does he think that that part of the report states whatif the fact the report goes on to sayit cannot be denied that indian wars have originated from this canse the sioux war in minota is supposed to have been produced in this way for alongetimo these officers havi been selected from partisan ranks not so much on account of honesty and qualification as devotion to party interests and their willingness to apply the money of the indiana to promote the selfish schemes of local politicians we do not doubt that some such men may be in the service of the bureau now again they sayand i read this in answer to the argument of the gentleman from massachusettsill this connection we deeni it of the highest importance thatno gornoror legislaturo of states or territories be permitted to call out and equip troops far the purpose of carrying o war against the indians it was colorado troos that involved us in the war of 186465 with the cheyennes it was a regiment oa hundred day men that perpetrated the butchery at sand creek and took from the treasury millions of money my distinguished friend front now york alluded warmly in the progress of his remarks to the saud creek massacre the commission say again aregiment of lont ai troops last september would have involved no lean almost intermiablo war with the crows but for the timely intervention of the military authorities so that according to this commission these indian wars are hot attributable to the regular army this is a report signed by the president of the commission n g taylor the commissioner of indian affairs by j b henderson general sherman general harucy john b sanborn general terry mr tappan and general augur what i have read is from the first report of this commission the one alluded to by the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts and the one upon which my friend from new york based his argument now what do the commission say when they come again to treat of this question when they met in chicago october 9 1868 they speak of this question again they had already given their testimony that it was undoubtedly true that thousands of dollars had been pocketed by the indian agents and that the indians had not received the annuities and goods to which they were entitled they attributed the indian wars to what to the army of the united states how does the army operate i only upon the call of the interior department and these very men who have control of this peace arrangement the officers of the army act in obedience to orders they are so trained the gentleman from new york said among ether things that if you give these indians over to the army it would be a sentence of death to the indian his declaration was that it was a sentence of death to the indian to give him into the custody of the war department if this is the case let me ask whence came all these massacres and wars to which he and the gentleman from massachusetts have alluded in the progress of this debate they have all occurred since 1849 during your peace administration while the secretary of the interior has bad control and management of indian affairs you do not propose to remove the army 7o you and if you do not and continne your peace establishment what evidencei is there of the assertion that if you turn the indian over to the war department it will be death to the indian can you turn him over to a more certain death than that of the peace management when this convoution met in chicago in 1868 this very same peace commission what did they then say they passed a series of resolutions and i will read the two last alusolved that the military force should be used to compel the removal into said reservation of all suil tidladis ns iowi retnow tigi ater due noic lies linen given to them that provision has been mnade to teed and protect them within the same again they said in their concluding resolution and i call the attention of the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from massachusetts to this language ljesoved that in th opinion of this coission the nbureau of indian affairs should be transferred from the department of the interior to the depaitment of war so that in point of fact the only ground upon which the distinguishecd gentleman from new york and his friend from massachusetts stand is swept from under them their arguments in opposition to this bill are built upon pillars of ice the first warm breeze oftruth that comes across them sweeps the foundatios from under them and leaves nothing for their magnificent fabric of war bloodshed and massacre to rest upon now the distinguished gentleman from new york presented in this very argument a complete answer to his own assertion that to tmn over the management of indian affairs to the war department is to turn them over to sentence of death and destruction and extermination the gentleman from massachusetts has predicated his argument upon the idea that this peace commission was opposed to the measure and that their testimony on thismatter is to be relied upon in preference to that of anybody else it has been said that the most formidable opponent a distinguished man has to encounter and both these gentlemen have evinced marked ability in the progress of this debate is himself therefore i put the argument made by the gentleman from new york on one page of his speech against the argument made by him upon another page but we may be able to excuse it upon the ground that even olympian jove does not always nod with the same power and significance and that i apollo eque scmper tendit arcum you cannot expect therefore that these gentlemen shall be credited by the committee when the very evidence on which they asktle committee to believe them is swept from beneath their feet"], [0.11264804005622864, 0.11264804005622864, 0, "i do not desire to multiply words to any considerable extent on this question but i agree with my colleague from illinois that to a very great extent we are striking in the dark in this legislation ay and i should not wonder if even my colleague if this bill is passed should come to see he too was striking in the dark what is this bill it proposes to fix a uniform compensation for railroad transportation all over the united states whether there be much or little business whether space is the principal object to the railroad or the making a trip is the principal object to the railroad the gentleman also says in this connection in regard to a great many of the small roads of the country from eight to twelve feet is enough certainly it is enough but it cuts the pay down on this class of roads even at six mills nearly onehalf yet upon these other large roads which run so much more rollingstock and more trains and utilize all their space it greatly increases their pay 0 but says the gentleman it will cut off the fastmail service i do not understand that it will out off the fastmail service it is tine that the gentleman from lndiana has spoken of the report of the transportation committee and of the price of commutation to passengers but i appeal to the gentleman whether it is not the fact thet these roadsi mean the great trunk linescan do the mail service at greatly loss pay than they now get while the small roads cannot afford to it it for less than they now get but here you apply the same schedule of pay to the small roads and the big roads how is it that these big roads can carry passengers at two cents a mile while your roads in illinois and texas require three and four cents a mile because the most of the carspace on the large roads is utilized and it requires no more engines to draw a train full of passengers than one partially full hence passenger rates are differcut on different roads and a bill ought to be devised providing different compensation for different roads but under this bill the rate for both is made the same i desire to refer to another point i have been challenged in private by two or three gentlemen as to may information how these great trunk lines which utilize the whole of their space can afford to sell comuntation tickets at less than four mills per mile the correctness of the statement has been denied now i have in my hand and will incorporate in my remarks a statement made by one of the most competent men in my opinion in the country in regard to such matters i refer to hen mr davis adjuster of pay of railroads in the postoffice department the statement is as follows speaking of the eric railroad the countinghouse monitor shows the commutation rates for passengers whom the company engaged to carry daily to an fro throughout the year were for a dis taste of 10 mciles from now york city a little ever 9j 9 584 mills per mile for a distance of 4h miles a little under 4 91s mills per mile and for a distance of s stiles a little over 31 3 267 mills per mile the rate decreasiog in every instance as the distance increased comparing the regular rate of fare for passengers travel tog ihe greatest distance that is for through passengers with lie cemmutatien rate for the greatest distance tho former being 22 mills is 6 73 thues as great as the latter which t 3 267 mills qc23 267=6 73 thec two rates are doeei to be the fairest for comparison but the lowest eommutatien rate on the erie is net as low as that of the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore rlatilroad on which annual tickets between philadelphia and baltimore a distance of 98 miles for a year commencing on the 1st of jannry as it is aecerfnined by intqutity from a officer of the company are sold for 250 which is at the rate of 3 q2c millo per mile asd the average rate for a lees average dislace on several other roads mentioned in the monitor is still less the rate being for 88 miles on the now jersey lidland 2 904 mills for 13 nuiles on the new york new haven and hartford 3 194 mills tsr 62 miles on the delaware

indian tribes but the policyof the government is mow to restrain those indians on the reservations devoting to civilization large portions of the vast domain heretofore occupied bythem and providing

missouri river at points contiguous to the means of transportation so that there will be a saving to the government in feeding the indians in addition to the transfer of this valuable country to the

actual returns except for the month of june which is estimated the surplus of revenues applicable to the extinguishment of the public debt is 23 108 534 23 now sir it will appear instead of the condition of the treasury being calculated to alarm the country that without any addition to taxation but by reduction of expenditures in a former and republican congressfor none yet proposed by this has taken effectit has been so wellordered that the revenues have exceeded the expenditures in an increasing amount from year to year in round numbers from two millions in 187374 to thirteen millions and in the present fiscal year to twentythree millions there is another point which i wish to state there is no deficiency ti falling back of the revenue from any source except customs from internal revenue we have steadily advanced it being one hundred and sixteen millions for this fiscal year of 1876 and only one hundred and ten millions for the fiscal year ending in 1875 and that notwithstanding the difficulties arising out of the frauds and proseeutions under the bureau of internal revenue connected with the production of distilled spirits the miscellaneous receipts have been increasing also beyond the estimates and the position of the treasury is stronger this year than it has been at any time during three fiscal years that condition will be fully shown by the tables i send up to the reporter to be inserted as part of my remarks and they will be open to the inspection of the gentleman from pennsylvania tle tables are as follows comparative statetaeft of receipts ad

prmises this is the only way questiois of this kind ever can be decided where is the court that can adjudicate upon the constitutionality of t question like this clearly the sill of the people expressed through their representatives in congress must ex necessitate rei be the supreme law whether this or that measure is right proper or coustitutional must depend in a great degree upon the merits of the particular case in hand and as what the common law of england is depends upor what courts say it is so the spirit meaning and comnmon sense of the costitution must be determined in matters not siscelitible of adjudication by the supreme court by the congress of the united states sir i amnot much troubled by constitutional scruples in voting for this bill but there is to my mind a greater difficulty to overcome i allude to the propriety of now annnlliung the reiterated entctmonts in former bills that the united states shall not be liable directly or indirectly for any expenses attending the exposition or by reason of tbe same while i shall vote for this bill i should have less hesitatioi in doing so if it did not seem to me to violate an implied pledge that no such appropriation as row asked for would he mad atd i wish to say that although enactments of the character referred to are repealable i think that whcie a bill is once passed the honor of the iation shall be considered as pledged to strict compliance with its provisions unless some great and unforeseen emergency arises rendering its repeal necesstry 1 object to nmking laws made and intended to be repealed to obtainieg the votes of oite congress upon the repeated promises of the friends of a measure embodied in statute laws thmt no money would be asked from the government and yet so ingeniously
