flag may pass through the canal without the payment of toll i quite agree with the gentleman my colleague touching the construction of that treaty and i am gratified that i had the pleasure of listening to his remarks and that the house also had an opportunity of hearing his views the united states is a great big country and domestic affairs during my service in the house have kept me so busy that i have not had much time to devote to our foreign relations so that i do not profess to be fully competent to discuss our foreign relations and i am not an expert regarding the treaties we have made with other countries of the world but i want to inquire in the first i kiace as to toll on our ships in the coastwise trade when they pass through the panama canal i want also to inquire regarding the amendment in section 11 amending section 5 of the commerce act and prohibiting any railway or other comion carrier from having any interest in any other common carrier by water when the railway or other carrier is a competitor with any other carrier by water now there is a cleavage between the gentleman from california representative knowland and the gentleman from minnesota representative stevens they agree in some respects and in others they disagree i listened with great pleasure yesterday to the gentleman from minnesota make one of the most admirable speeches that i have ever heard in the house but after all it seemed to me that the speech rested upon a shadow for a foundation and what a magnificent building he did build considering the foundation ours is a representative government we all respond to public sentiment and the interests primarily of our constituency therefore i can see how the gentleman who represents st paul minn and it is ably and patriotically representedwould hold a different view as to the real or supposed interest of the gentleman who represents the golden gate than is held by that gentleman himself the gentleman who represents the golden gate ably and interestingly insists that the coastwise trade of the united states is barred to all the flags of all the world that we own the panama canal and thal the people on the pacific coast are interested in having coastwise trade pass through that canal without the payment of tolls i was greatly interested and i applauded when he said that the waterways of the great republic were without toll for american ships in the coastwise trade and interstatecommerce trade i was aware that that was the case and i am glad it is they will always be free so far as my vote is concerned i followed him when he spoke about the dollar a ton that this bill would levy on our ships passing through the canal and the burden that would impose on that part of our interstate trade which will go by water from cairo from the upper mississippi river and from the ohio down to the gulf and in fullness of time pass through the canal and to the pacific coast and how that additional burden if imposed would protect the transcontinental railways which run through the district represented so ably by the gentleman from minnesota that is to say that in the competition with the trianscontinental railways that dollar a ton on waterborne commerce would cut some figure that would affect all the interstate commerce of this great country do gentlemen stop to think that this great countryi have frequently made this statement but it is apt to make it againhas an annual production of thirty thousand millions of dollars more than 90 per cent of which is consumed and goes to market by water and by railhay in the united states out of that thirty thousand million dollars worth of products only two thousand million dollars worth goes to foreign markets we produce in the united states more than onethird of all the products of all the civilized world and when you put an exceptional burden of a dollar a ton on the coastwise trade it affects every ton substantially that goes into our internal commerce whether it goes by rail or by water i will drop that part of it right there and come to one other thing the first amendment in sectioa 11 prohibits any competing railway or common carrier from having any interest in a common carrier by water that may be wise and it may not i never owned a share of stock in a railway in my life so that i think i may be permitted to discuss very briefly that matter without somebody saying that i stand for the interests that i stand for the railroads and so forth and so forth i do not stand for them except as they are necessary to our civilization and development i want to utilize them now a ship in the coastwise trade flying the american flag is a ship without regard to who owns it here are several transcontinental railways running from one ocean to the other great corporations engaged in a great commerce if perchance they are competitors with carriers by water it is under the provisions of the proposed amendment a misdemeanor with a severe penalty for them to own any interest directly or indirectly in any such water carrier suppose that provision goes on the statute bookscarriers by rail do not have all the money in the worldand there enters into the coastwise trade some one who by superior ships and superior service should succeed in monopolizing the great bulk of freight passing from one coast to the other where is your remedy you could not prosecute under the sherman antitrust act unless you could show there was a combination in restraint of trade if the interstatecommerce law does not do so now it ought to be amended soas to cover our coastwise trade i do not believe it covers that trade now the railways in the united states onehalf of those in all the world conducting our great transportation business must charge reasonable rates why the law says so we have the power to require them to do so well what are reasonable rates we have created a commission to determine what are reasonable rates otherwise we would not get along very well there is no reason in my judgment why that legislation should not cover the coastwise trade as well the constitution is broad enough it gives congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and with foreign nations now what does this amendment do let us come down now to brass tacks as we used to say when we were schoolboys canada has ports on the pacificvancouver and prince rupert farther north and others yet to come no doubtand she will soon have three or four transcontinental lines connecting the pacific and the atlantic under existing treaties you can not shut canada out from passing through the panama canal true she would have to pay the tolls but mind you our own transcontinental railway peoplewho are just as wicked and no more wicked than similar people in canadawill not be permitted without a daily penalty to own any vessel that passes through the canal or have any interest in any vessel which would constitute a competing line does the same prohibition apply in the case of the canadian railways"], [0.018955333158373833, 0.018955333158373833, 0, "like the gentleman from ala bama my friend judge clayton who first addressed the house this morning i am extremely gratified that there is so large and intelligent an audience here at this time i think that fact is perhaps occasioned by reason of some one having given out the information that i was to endeavor at this time to make a speech upon this bill and it being about the usual lunch hour the pangs of hunger may have overcome in the minds of many of the members the thirst for intellectual entertainment i regret exceedingly under the circumstances that i have not any carefully prepared remarks for this occasion and i do not know that it will be possible for me to add anything of interest to the discussion that has been going on in this house for the past two weeks upon this bill and i do not know whether we are any of us being enlightened so very much ourselves or whether we are enlightening the country at all upon the tariff question it is not an entirely new question and yet it seems that an academic discussion of the principle of protection as opposed to the principle of free trade is now on the boards as of old and must from the necessities of the times and the political conditions prevailing again demand our attention and the attention of the country the president of the united states under the authority given him by the constitution and with the highest and purest motives of duty and patriotism called this congress together for a single purpose and that purpose was to pass upon the trade agreement that under his d~rection had been tentatively made with the dominion e f canada it seems to me that it would have been wise if this congress under the circumstances had foregone the opportunity to play politics and had disposed of that one question and adjourned and gone home i know that course would have been for the benefit of all the people of the country and i think would have commanded their unanimous approval this running amuck with the business interests of the country is what might have been expected from past experience and past history when the democratic party has been in control of this house and so far as i have observed in the past that course has never led to anything of advantage to the people of this country so far as the reciprocity agreement or the bill carryiag that agreement into effect awas concerned i can easily see how the democrats might differ among themselves as to the policy of that bill and i can also see how some republicans might favor it and how some might not for myself i believe and have long believed in the principle of reciprocity and in reciprocal trade agreements with other nations i believe that when we open up our markets to the other countries of the world we ought by some sort of reciprocal arrangement to get some benefit ourselves for so doing some equivalent for what we give and i am eternally opposed to the democratic doctrine of free trade because i believe most emphatically in american markets for americans i believe in protection to all american industries and to american labor and that our own people should have the preference in our own markets at all times and that if we yield anything as to that policy we ought to get an equivalent for it i believe that the agreement which this house so far as it is concerned has ratified with the dominion of canada will if consummated be to the material benefit of both countries i do not believe that it will injure the farmers of this country or any class of our people if i did so believe i would not be in favor of it i have some interests myself connected with the farming industry and i represent here a great agricultural district one of the greatest in the united states and i fully and firmly believe that the interests of the agricultural population of my district will be materially benefited by the consummation of this canadian reciprocity agreement at the same time i realize that i also represent other industries than that of agriculture alone for that district is also one of the greatest manufacturing districts of the country and has within its boundaries substantially every manufacturing industry that exists in the land and substantially every item in the canadian reciprocity bill and every item in this free list or freetrade bill is produced to a greater or less extent in my district we there manufacture each year millions of dollars worth of agricultural machinery and implements sewing machines and fence wire besides pretty nearly everything else that can be manufactured or produced in this country i regret that my distinguishedand eloquent friend and colleague from illinois should have seen fit to characterize the reciprocity agreement as an indication of the desire of the people of this country to be annexed to canada or for canada to be annexed to the united states whichever way you choose to put it because there is just as much danger in the one case as in the other also my genial friend and colleague from chicago mr madden had something to say about canadian annexation and the flag of this union floating all the way from the great lakes to the north pole discovered by dr cook now i want to assure both of my colleagues that i do not think there is any danger of canadian annexation or any intention whatever or any desire on the part of the people of this country for annexation at any time in the future and i do not think it will come until long years after our enthusiastic friend from alabama has fought to a finish his fight with japan and wiped the mikado and all his subjects from off the face of the earth or off from the waters of the sea whichever it may be the time may come and i am not sure but what it will come when the dominions to the north of us will constitute an independent republic and when a new flag of freedom will float over all that great land from our northern border to the frozen seas of the north that time i say may come but annexation never and all this talk of annexation is nothing more nor less than sensational bosh the people of canada are our friends we have no designs upon their government or their territory but to wish them well our relations can never be anything but friendly and commercial reciprocity between canada and the united states is in accordance with natural law and can only result for the good of the people there and here who would claim for a moment that unrestricted trade between our great grainproducing states in the northwest and the other states of the union is to the detriment of the other states if it were possible that minnesota and the dakotas and montana might be separated from the united states and if we had a tariff barrier against their products their grain and their cattle would either we or they be better off manifestly not this reciprocity agreement only applies to a limited extent the same rules as to exchange of products with canada that we now have between the several states i would if i could wipe out all the trade barriers between canada and the united states and have unrestricted trade in all the products of the soil and in all manufactures and all commodities of every name and kind the same as we have here between the several states to my understanding reciprocity is the natural sequence to the republican policy of protection and the two should go hand in hand together reciprocity was advocated by blaine and mckinley and the other great republican leaders of the past if the democratic party have now taken it up they have simply followed the wisdom of past republican leaders and adopted past republican platforms the democratic majority in this house seem to now have taken up this doctrine of reciprocity and are supporting it with great enthusiasm as i have read the democratic platforms in the past i have understood that that party claimed always that all protection was robbery and that reciprocity was only another name for protection that that has been the doctrine of the democratic party and is today the real belief of many of its leaders is confirmed by the speeches we have heard from that side of the house from day to day in support of the bill now pending let us stop and consider for a moment how wholly inconsistent the canadian reciprocity measure is with the freetrade bill now under consideration for call it a fariers freelist bill or whatever you will this bill now under consideration is nothing more nor ldss than an absolute freetrade measure there is no protection in it for any industry and there is no reciprocity in it in effect the democratic party in this house are now saying to canada we have passed the reciprocity bill but you need not ratify it there because we propose to give you more than you ask by subsequent bills and to ask nothing from you in return that is to say we will put on the free list not only as to canada but as to all the countries of the earth the very articles upon which we have just ratified a reciprocal arrangement for mutual duties what consistency can there be in ratifying an agreement with canada which fixes a certain rate of duty upon meats agricultural implements and other commodities reciprocal as to each country and then before that agreement becomes effective follow up immediately with a freetrade bill proposing to put those same things on the free list without any concessions whatever from the other contracting party is not this the height of democratic inconsistency are you simply using this reciprocity measure proposed by a republican president for the sole and only purpose of making political capital and for the purpose of having that agreement not ratified by canada because if your policy prevails they can then have our markets free without any concession whatever now i thought awhile ago and i do not know but i said once upon the floor of this house that i believed it would be a good idea when the tariff was revised that it might be revised schedule by schedule and one thing at a time i have changed my mind about that this bill shows how such a policy would work and it is very much like cutting off the dogs head by commencing at his tail and cutting off an inch at a time this bill shows an intention on the part of the democratic majority in this house to ruin certain industries one at a time and to put certain articles a few at a time upon the free list without any protection whatever and then to follow it up with some other articles one at a time until the doctrine of free trade is universally established as the policy of the country and the policy of protection is gone forever my learned friend the distinguished gentleman from alabama judge clayton this morning said very truly that the line of demarcation between the republican party and the democratic party was never more clearly drawn than it is today that the republican party was the party of protection and the democratic party for free trade or tariff for revenue only that is absolutely true no man with a drop of republican blood in his veins can justify himself in voting for this freetrade measure this bill it will be observed is a freetrade bill pure and simpleat least simple it is not even a tariffforrevenueonly bill it never could produce any revenue whatever for the government because it does not propose to reduce the rates of duty but to admit all the articles mentioned absolutely free of duty under the dingley law the duty on sewing machines was 45 per cent the payne law reduced this duty to 30 per cent this bill puts sewing machines on the free list not to permit competition with foreignmade machines but to give an actual advantage to the foreign manufacturer and thus seriously handicap if not entirely ruin a great home industry substantially the same is true as to the shoe and leather industry why in the name of reason if our democratic friends consider the duties too high do they not propose to reduce them to what they consider a revenue basis rather than deprive the government of all revenue and the home industry of all protection that is the proposition before us today that is the proposition upon which both political parties are to go before the country it is the policy of protection to american industry and american labor on the one hand that has made this country the most prosperous upon the face of the earth or on the other hand it is the policy that has always brought stagnation in business and ruin and desolation to qur people the policy of democratic free trade it is proved now so that there can be no misunderstanding about it that the democratic party of today as it always has been in the past is a party of free trade that if it was in power in all of the departments of government and could do so it would level every customhouse in the land and allow all foreign products to enter and compete in our home markets in competition with our own people and without requiring any tariff tax or payment of any kind for that great privilege oh my democratic friends when the people of this country understand your purpose when they understand that that is the doctrine you are advocating piece by piece they will again relegate you to the rear and they will again reinstate in all the departments of this government that party that has made this country the most progressive and the most prosperous upon the face of the earth let me cite you to one little thinga little joker so to speakthey put in this socalled farmers freelist bill i wonder why they call it a farmers fteelist bill have you done some injury to the farmer for which you propose to recompense him you seem at least to not have done or proposed anything that by any possibility could injure any farmers south of mason and dixons line i observe that you do not put rice and peanuts and oranges and pineapples and other products of the south upon the free list but instead in order to fool the people you pick out here and there some industry in the northern states not in the south that you think it safe to attack and say if we can pass that and wipe that industry out of existence every section of the country interested in that industry will join us and demand the same treatment for such other industries as we may wish to attack among the items selected and put upon the free list in this bill is sewing machines i wonder why you put sewing machines upon the free list in this bill and why this one industry was selected for your attack i presume it is probably true that there is not a sewingmachine factory in the entire south and consequently you will find no opposition in that section of the country to free trade in sewing machines but why did you not propose to put all other kindred machines such as typewriters knitting machines and everything else of that same mature upon the free list also by this bill true there are not many sewingmachine factories in this country very few of them perhaps you thought you would not antagonize veiy many localities by singling out sewing machines for your attack now it so happens that i come from a little town in the state of illinois that is known far and near as tha sewingmachine town the little city of belhidere with a population of between seven and eight thousand people has one of the largest independent sewingmachine factories in this country the national sewing machine co in that town employs on an average probably a thousand men and is the support of at least onehalf the entire population of that little city and under this bill you propose to put sewing machineg or the free list without any reason whatever being given for so doing so far as i can understand i do not understand that there is any such thing as a sewingmachine trust in this country i know that the company in ily town is not connected with any trust or any other company anywhere in the world it is an independent factory doing a large and fairly profitable business although the profit on each sewing machine made under the competition that exists is so sriall as to be a mere trifle there is one large sewing machine conc~ern known as the singer co and sometimes called the sewingmachine trust although i do not understand that it is a trust or that it has connection with subsidiary concerns but that great company probably manufactures more than 60 per cent of all the sewing machines made in the world it has fr ctories in several places in the united states it has factories in canada and in scotland and i think in other countries of europe it would not be affected at all by placing sewing machines upon the free list because it could manufacture the same machines in its factories abroad with cheap foreign labor and send those machines into this country free of duty and at prices that would crush out absolutely every independent sewingmachine concern in the land there is but one other country under present conditions that could compete with us in the manufacture of sewing machines and that is germany i understand that sewing machines are manufactured there on a large scale and that labor is very much cheaper than it is here and withoutpny tariff protection they could send their machines into the united states duty free and crush out of existence every sewingmachine company in the land except the singer co which would be their only competitor and all that too without making sewing machines any cheaper to the purchaser than they are today and that is what would happen should this bill become a law in its present formif our democratic friends succeed in getting it passed and upon the statute books which i do not believe they even hope to do there is very little profit in sewing machines now made by tese independent concerns in competition with thesinger co the independent concerns sell their machines to dealers and they are again sold at very low prices if you will take up a catalogue of one of the great department stores or mailorder houses you will find there the prices at which such sewing machines as are made in my district are sold two of the largest mailorder houses perhaps are in chicago namely montgomery ward co and sears roebuck co if you will examine their catalogues you will find that you can buy a firstclass sewing machine at retail at from 8 to 21 and the machine that is sold by these houses at retail today for 8 is as good a machine in every respect as my mother paid 100 for when i was a boy if you want a fancy piece of furniture in addition to the sewing machine you can pay as high as 21 to one of these concerns for such a machine the singer co does business on entirely a different plan they sell their machines through agents all over the country nd on time with payments of from 50 cents a week to a dollar a month or something of that kind they have great capital and can afford to do business in that way and thereby they get higher prices for their machines it would not affect that company a particle to put sewing machines on the free list but it would crush out absolutely the one great industry of my town and county and throw out of employment in that little town a thousand men while half the people of the town would be deprived of a livelihood and forced to seek other employment now this is only one example of what our democratic friends are proposing to do by the passage of this bill it is only one industry that is picked out for attack but if we tire to believe what they tell us it is to be followed up by attacking other industries one at a time all along the line until no vestige of protection shall be left and until foreign countries may send their manufactured products into the united states without let or hindrance in competition with our own industries and thereby force out of employment our own people who are now the bestpaid laboring people in the world is that what we want they tell us in the report on this socalled farmers free list bill that its passage would reduce the revenues of the government something over 10 000 000 a year and the revenue we should lose is nothing compared to the greater injury that would necessarily follow ten million dollars reduction in the revenues of the country is of course no small item but we could stand that if it were not for the fact that under the freetrade provisions of this bill hundreds of millions of dollars worth of manufactured products from abroad each year made by the cheap labor of other countries would come into the united states in competition with our own industries and that just so much less would be manufactured in our own factories and by our own people so that necessarily thousands and hundreds of thousands of laborers who are dependent upon the success of american industries and american factories would be forced to seek other employment or to accept a very great reduction in wages and possibly both that is what the democratic party in this house under its present leadorship is proposing to do to the american people it is only a beginning but already we can see what the effects are sure to be my time is almost up and before i get through i desire to say a few words in regard to some remarks made by my good friend from tennessee the other day he is honest and sincere and means what he says he seems to think that one evil of the protective system is that it provides means whereby the government may pay pensions to its old soldiers and that does not seem to please him let me quote from what he said in his speech the other day but as i said when i started out we are not limited to a tariff tax we can resort to other taxes as we have resorted to other taxes internal revenue brings i believe something over 300 000 000 the corporation tax brought over 25 000 000 last year now my friends there is going to be a demand i suppose for the passage of a general pension bill to increase the pensions of the soldiers which will run into many millions of dollars i have no criticism to make of the motives behind it there were not enough gentlemen to get an ayeandno vote in opposition to the bill that the gentleman from illinois presented in the last congress if we are going to increase any kind of an expenditure by millions of dollars we have got to raise revenue by millions of dollars to meet it now there is going to come business stagnation is that what you are working for is that what is proposed in the passage of this bill let me go on i quote again from mr simss speech now there is going to come business stagnation it will be impossible to avoid it you may just as well get ready for it yes that is what the democratic majority of this house promises us is it business stagnation yes i am afraid it is going to come i know and every man in this house knows that it is already on its way as you can find by looking up the reports of business concerns all over the country today the very threat that you make to take off tariff duties to reduce the revenues to wipe out of existence boot and shoe factories and sewingmachine factories and other industries the very threat that you make to inaugurate your doctrine of free trade is already bringing business stagnation throughout this country oh yes if you have your way and the old soldiers are paid the pensions which they ought to be paid we shall have to issue bonds or shall have to increase the internalrevenue taxes or we shall have to impose a stamp tax as the gentleman from tennessee says"], [0.019970672205090523,

entitled a bill to reduce the duties on wool and manufactures of wool it is a bill independent by itself it is not and does not purport to be an amendment to the existing tariff law if passed its language takes effect as a new independent law repealing of course those laws that are inconsistent with it but it is not inserted as a part of the payne law and by its passage it does not become an amendment to the payne law the amendment i have offered proposes to have the bill inserted as an amendment to the payne law so that it will not repeal other provisions in the payne law which may or ought to remain in the law for instance the payne law provides that nothing in that act shall be held or construed to abrogate in any way the cuban reciprocity treaty or the law based upon it but if this bill be enacted as a separate and independent act fixing as it does the rates of duty upon woolen importations it absolutely repeals so far as wool and woolen goods are concerned both the cuban reciprocity treaty and the cuban reciprocity law which we passed if this should be inserted as an amendment to the payne law it would not repeal the maximum and minimum provisions of the law but if it be passed as an independent measure as it now stands it absolutely repeals so far as wools and woolens are concerned the maximum and minimum provisions of the existing tariff law if it is the purpose of the majority of the house to repeal the maximum and minimum provisions of the law as to wool and woolens then the offer of the bill is correct but if it is intended to leave to our country the maximum and minimum club which has been used quite effectively so far then this should be inserted as an amendment to the payne law the amendment which i have offered is to strike out the paragraphs of the payne law relating to wool and woolens and to insert the text of this bill as an amendment to the payne law that would be the ordinary and sensible provision for amending this law that is not all as will be shown later in the debateor perhaps it may be well to refer to it nowthis bill contains all through it the provision not otherwise specified in this act manufactures composed wholly or in part of wool not otherwise specified in this act i called the attention of the house in my opening speech on this bill to the fact that under its provisions it would put the woolen tariff upon every piece of goods composed partly of wool and partly of cotton and i was told by gentlemen on that side of the house who were not well informed that if the goods were composed in chief value of cotton they would pay the cotton schedule and if composed in chief value of wool they would pay the woolen schedule that is true of the existing law because the courts have said that under the existing law there was special provision made so that where goods were composed in chief value of cotton they would pay the cotton schedule but as this bill is not an amendment to the existing law as it does not purport to amend the existing law and as it is written last its provisions take effect as independent provisions and the provisions of this bill are that all manufactures composed wholly or in part of wool shall pay the duty provided in this act unless otherwise specially provided for in this act now if the amendment which i offer prevails the term this act will apply to the law to which this is amendatorythe existing tariff lawbut if my amendment does not prevail the term this act will refer to this woolenschedule act and there being no other provision in this act in reference to goods composed in part of wool then all goods composed in part of wool must pay the duty fixed by this act for instance we authorize in the existing law the importation by a traveler abroad coming home of 100 worth of wearing apparel but this act if it passes in its present form will so far as woolen goods are concerned repeal the existing law because this act provides that all woolen goods shall pay the duty provided for in this act the new act unless otherwise specially provided for in this act the new act but if the amendment which i have offered prevails that language might remain in

department of 10 000 for the construction of a bridge it is now proposed to authorize an investigation of the conditions necessitating the construction of the bridge and 1 000 is appropriated not made reimbursable these indians have large areas of land and it is proposed to build a bridge on the reservation up our way either the indians build bridges on their reservations or the counties build them the committee has shown some disposition to oppose the proposition which i presented and which i shall present in a form similar to this a little later on authorizing an investigation as to the necessity of building bridges and roads at the expense of the indians on the wind river reservation but here is an investigation proposed as to the necessity of building a bridge on an indian reservation at public expense if the indians do not need the bridge and have no use for it and it is to be used wholly by the white people the white people ought to pay for it and not the people of the united states if on the other hand the indians need the bridgeand they own much land some of it valuable and some of it of little valuethey ought to pay for the bridge in any event if we build the bridge and make an appropriation ultiinately for the building of the bridge we ought to provide that the sums expended should be reimbursable and that without regard to whether we ever expect to get it back or not we do expect to get it back and we ought to get it back and undoubtedly would get it back as these indians in the course of years secure enough to pay for it but in any event they

evening i have an announcement to make that i think will be rather popular and that is that i do not expect to occupy nearly all of the time that has been assigned to me i thank the gentleman fkom illinois for the applause which everybody feels like giving but which he was good enough not to give however fr chairman representing as i do one of the great woolgrowing districs of this country i should feel that i would be remiss in my duty if i did not say something about this bill which as i understand it is extremely inimical to the interests of a large number of the people whom i represent and not beneficial to anyone and which if enacted into law would mean practically the destruction of the sheep industry particularly in ohio pennsylvania and west virginiathat section known in the report of the tariff board as the ohio region i think i can show before i close that this is undoubtedly the case and that the majority in their report practically say that if this bill becomes a law the industry in what is known as the ohio region must either very materially change its form or absolutely cease to exist if this concourse with its sad assemblage of mourners is to be regarded as a sort of funereal occasion if the wool industry is to be consigned to destruction it seems to me that what little the friends of that great industry have to say about it would better be said before the industry is dead i am reminded of that little stanza of poetry which my friend from south carolina with his poetic instincts will appreciate and which runs like this a rose to tle living is more than sump pous wreaths to the dead in filling loves ilinite store a rose to the living is more if graciously given before the hungering spirit has fled a rose to the living is more than sumptuous wreaths to the dead so in harmony with the spirit of that stanza of poetry i want to place a few little flowers at the feet of the wool industry of this country rather than to place sumptuous wreaths upon its coffin for that is what i should have to do if i spoke after this bill became a law this debate which has been prolonged rather extensively is useful in a good many ways to my mind one of the things coming out of it that is the most valuable is the fact that in connection with the debates had on this bill last summer it has made the position of the gentlemen across the aisle with reference to the wool industry and the other industries of this country absolutely clear as was said just now by my friend from pennsylvania some of us in certain sections of the union have known of gentlemen running on the democratic ticket and asserting that they were good protectionists this debate has torn the mask off that proposition because we have heard it asserted here by the leader across the aisle we have had offiial pronouncement to the effect that the democratic party does not stand for any such thing as protection to any industry for example here in debate the other day on the sugar bill the distinguished able and courteous leader of the democracy the gentleman from alabama said in response to an inquiry by the gentleman from louisiana that he did not know what effect that bill would have upon the sugar industry of louisianaproposing legislation not knowing whether it would strike down or destroy an industry and that was followed up a little later in that same debate by an admission of another distinguished leader on that side of the house the gentleman from georgia in which he said substantially that he was willing to go further than the gentleman from alabama he said that in his opinion it would absolutely destroy the industry in that state and then upon the question of the wool industry it has been said upon this floor several times in the course of this debate admitted in the reports of the committee both upon this bill at this time and upon a similar bill last summer absolutely officially admitted that it is going very seriously to cripple the industry if not absolutely to destroy it and a member of the committee on ways and means the gentleman from massachusetts said here in the debate wherr questioned by my colleague from ohio i r longwonti in response to the inquiry of mr longworat that it did not make any difference in his judgment if he knew that the rate proposed in this bill namely 20 per cent would absolutely wipe out the industry that that would not be considered at all that the only thing our friends the democrats were considering was the raising of revenue it has been stated here that in time to come when the revenue would not be needed then that the duty should be absolutely and unqualifiedly abolished in other words it is now known to the farmers of this country and the sheepmen of this country that it is proposed absolutely to put wool upon the free list just as soon as it can be doue why it is said here in the committee report that was made last summer and i read from it you will find it on page 26 of the report of the ways and means committee it is maintained by a very large number of our best economists and statcsmeni suppose he refers to democratic economists and statesmenit is maintained by a very large number of our best economists and statcsinn that the economic situation involved in our rapid progress as a nation requires that our ports should be thrown open to the importation of wool free of duty and this view based on the most profound consideration of the public welfare has found expression in democratic legislation it is the constant intent of the democratic party to make the burden of tariff taxes as light as possible for the people and to levy tariff taxes on a revenue basis as promptly as possible for the party recognizes no justification whatever for tariff taxes except the necessity of revenue later on in the same report it is said the bill it 11 11010 is not to lie construed as an abandbnment of any democratic policy but in view of the democratic platform for a gradual reduction of the tariffand by the way as we go along if that is the attitude of the democratic party when you brought in the sugar bill the other day this platform declaration ought to have been considered in regard to a gradual reduction of the tariff and of the depleted and depleting condition of the public treasuryis not that awful of course everybody knew at the time that that statement was a fiction and the logic of events has absolutely proved it to be so because the depleted treasury turned out to have a surplus of something over 40 000 000 and of the depleted and depleting condition of the public treasury a result of republican extravagance a tariff of 20 per cent ad valorem on raw wool is now proposed as a revenue necessity in other words it is perfectly clear that there is no intention to maintain any protective duty whatever on wool i think i am perfectly fair in making that statement and am not misrepresentingranybody so the woolgrowers of the county ought to understand that they are face to face with the proposition of free wool we have torn the mask aside and we know where our good friends the enemy are located on this proposition now i want to say that so far as i am concerned personally i am not altogether satisfied with some provisions in the present tariff on raw wool all woolgrowers are well acquainted with the fact that because of the peculiar classification and provisions in the existing law washed wool of class 2 comes in at the same rate as unwashed wool every woolgrower linows the importer takes advantage of that and brings in large quantities of washed wool in fact there is practically no unwashed wool of the second class brought in this practice reduces the shrinkage of imported wools and thereby crowds out our own wool then in the second place through the operation of the skirting clause which will be found very carefully referred to in the report of the tariff board pages 287 to 293 volume 1 advantage is again taken of the farmer these provisions are contained in paragraph 368 of the act of 1909 which is as follows the duty upon wool of the sheep or hair of the camel angora goat alpaca and other like animals of class 1 and class 2 which shall be imported in any other than ordinary condition or which has been sorted or increased in value by the rejection of any part of the original fleece shall be twice the duty to whih it would be otherwise subject p ovided that skirted wools as imported in 1890 and prior thereto are hereby excepted as has been explained here by two or three gentlemen who have spoken in australia they will take a fleece and lay it on a table or the floorand cut off the dirtier portion the less valuable portion and keep in the fleece only the best and cleanest wool then under the skirting clause this skirted fleece is brought into our country and of course everybody understands it must have a verylow rate of shrinkage as low as40 per cent and in many fleeces much lower than that now the tariff board refers to that in a very interesting way and r want to trespass on the good nature of the committee long enough to call attention to their statement because some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have not read the report of the tariff board i know some of them have not else they would not make the statements they have made why it has been stated here that there is not anything new in this report of the tariff board it was said that the information acquired might just as well have been acquired by correspondence the gentleman who makes that kind of statement surely does not have the materials of the report of this tariff board well in mind i think in regard to the details of the wool industry in the united states and elsewhere that this is the greatest work that has ever been undertaken by any nation there never has been any such collection of materials at first hand they did not simply write to somebody why it has been said their men were sent abroad certainly they were sent abroad they went into the sheepraising districts of australia and south america and made careful personal investigation that was the only way in which they could get at the facts and report to this tariff board it is a very voluminous report and they show some interestind facts at page 3s2 volume 2 on the subject i have just discussed i want to read part of their statement because i think it is very valuable information the complaint of the grower of domestic wools that he is not now and has not during all these years been receiving the amount of protection nominally extended by the 11cent duty on the grease pound is based upon the heavy shrinkage of the domestic fleece as against the lightconditioned skirted wools selected for importation primarily for their large net yield an examination of the existing duties will show that the schedule is constructed upon the theory that wool shrinks g01 per cent in the scouring since however it is certain that the wools actually imported shrink something less than 40 per cent it is obvious that instead of paying 11 duty for every 33a pounds of actual wool brought in the importer is really securing some 60 pounds at a rate of not to exceed 18 cents pe scoured pound in order that this matter may be more clearly understood the board has prepared a tabular statement in which the full effect of shrinkages upon the actual operation of the existing wool duties is shown present greasepound rates with computed scouredpound equivalents actual duty on scoured content shrinkage class i class ii wools wools duty per duty per pound pound 11 cents 12 cents 75 per cent 0 44 0 48 70 per cent 361 40 c5 per cent co per cent 30 15 per cent 24a 26 50 per cent 22 24 45 per cent 20 21a 40 per cent 1s1 20 25 per cent 10 1 i am z0 per cent 12 17 25 per cent 14 li 0 per cent 13 15 gentlemen can readily figure that out for themselves of course everybody knows that is true but let us see how it works out suppose that the law operated as it was intended that it should operate in that case if you bought 100 pounds of wool in the foreign market and it was brought in here and would shrink 66i per cent you would have left 33j pounds of wool that would make the rate what the law intended it should bethat is 33 cents on the scoured pound as a matter of fact how does it work out under this skirting clause of which i have spoken the importer goes into the foreign market and buys wool that shrinks not 66j per cent but wool tsat shrinks 40 per cent or less then out of his 100 pounds of wool instead of having 33j pounds he will have 60 pounds and if he divides the amount of duty which he has to pay 1l on the 100 poundsby 60 instead of 33j under the supposed arrangement it will be seen that the farmer has not been getting anything like 33 cents protection on the scoured pound he is really getting only about 18 cents protection on the scoured pound here is the thing i am objecting to under the present law the farmer has been charged with receiving a protection of 11 cents a potnd on grease wool or 33 cents a pound on scoured wool the fact is he has not received it he has received only a little over onehalf of what he was really entitled to under the law"], [0.030593005940318108, 0.030593005940318108, 0, "or cement or concrete what is the distinction between fence

following the appropriation by congress for the original purchase of the philippine islands an appropriation was carried in the fortification bill which related directly and specifically to the philippine islands some member of the house unfortunatelyand as i believe unwiselymade a point of order against the item in the fortification bill and the point of order was sustained following this the chairman of the committee on appropriations simply increased the total appropriation carried by the fortification bill and as a result there was no itemization of that part of the appropriation which related to the philippine islands now as the result of that there has been no bookkeepingif you will permit the wide license of language which that statement impliesby congress and we know absolutely nothing with reference to the philippine cost except the information which was conveyed by two very incomplete and very fragmentary reports which have been submitted to congress now as i conceive it one of the most useful operations in our public life is the element of publicity congress must of necessity gain information from the president and the executive departments with reference to public expense and this information then filters by means of this agency into the legitimate channels of publicity i think the gentleman from illinois will agree that there should be the fullest publicity possible with reference to all expenditures and we have little or no information with reference to the expenses in the philippine islands then to show a justification for this resolution i would call to the attention of the house this situation in 1 902 secretary root was asked for a statement of the philippine expenses and he submitted a report which covered the years ensuing between 1898 and 1902 since this session of congress the committee on expenditures for the war department at one of its sessions asked gen wood if he could give some approximate idea of the cost of philippine occupation he returned to his office and submitted a statement now i want to call the attention of the house to a very marked discrepancy which appears in the wood report it is shown that the government has expended during the years between 1898 and 1 902 almost 7 000 000 for railroad transportation in connection with the philippine service the wood report for the same years states the expense for railroad transportation at 4 800 000 a discrepancy of 2 000 000 with reference to that one item alone in a statement also which gen wood submitted to the committee on expenditures in the war department he said that the reports of some departments were missing that he had called for reports from some of the bureau chiefs but that he had been unable to procure reports from the departments which i will name the disbursing clerk the insular division and surgeon general i want to call attention to another significant circumstance in the statement which gen wood made to the committee on expenditures in the war departiment he carries absolutely no charge or item for railroad transportation during the year 1908 we all know that there was an expense incurred for that purpose in 1 907 the railroad expense was 667 000 and in 1905 it was 588 000 so it is entirely fair for us to assume that there was an expenditure for railroad expense in 1908 another matter in the wood report the general says nwith reference to report of this office of expenditures due to the military occupation of the philippine islands from december 8 1898 to include tune 30 1911 and to the summary of cost as shown on the past page of said report it is stated for the information of the chief of staff that these figures do not include the cost incurred due to the mobilization and discharge camps in connection with the assembling and mustering out of volunteers and enlisted for duty in the philippine islands this it is believed is a considerable item of expense but can only be obtained by going through all of the records of the suenly points of the camps concerlhed which would take from three to four months to gather i think this circumstance clearly shows the propriety of this resolution and it shlould be further stated that practically every executive department of the government has had something to do with the philippine service with the possible exception of the interior department and that they have disbursed money with reference to the philippine service i call the attention of the house to some very important matters which developed in connection with even the fragmentary information which the house now has it will doubtless be amazing to my colleagues to know that the loss of life in the philippine islands has been so great as to compel the expenditure in one year of 200 000 to bring back to this country the remains of officers and men who lost their lives in the philippines attention is also called to the fact that in one year the transport expenses amounted to more than 10 000 000 almost half of the sum carried by the army bill in the appropriations made in the year prior to the spanish war it has cost between one and two million dollars a year for coal for transports i notice here that in one year they expended 500 000 for the purchase of some old transports and then they expended 5 000 000 to repair them i do not want to take the time of the house nor tax the patience of my colleagues on the floor because i know that many other matters are pressing for attention but i insist that every man within the hearing of my voice will fill the full measure of his duty when he gives support to a resolution to give to the people the truth and the facts and nothing more with reference to this great question i want to assure

"the vice of considering this important bill under a special rule which limits debate upon its merits to the short space of one hour and a half on each side has already been made apparent to this house at the very outset of this argument the limitation of time imposed upon me makes it impossible for me to discuss adequately the great underlying fundamental legal principles which should be carefully weighed by the house before any vote is taken upon the bill three distinct reasons have been urged by the proponents of this rule as a necessity for speedy legislation upon this bill it has been boldly proclaimed by the advocates of the bill that the united states courts are the creatures of congress that congress has by legislation called them into existence and that congress has therefore tie power to modify control or destroy their functions an d to p lace all of the limitations it pleases upon their judicial power it has also been further asserted that these courts have abused that judicial power that under existing laws they have employed the writ of injunction as an instrument of oppression to certain classes of the people and that this unwarranted usurpation by the courts has created a pressing necessity for this legislation one speaker who has preceded me has indeed boldly declared that the courts of the united states have violated the elemental principles of justice have substituted the equitable power of the court for the criminal processes of the land have punished crime through the medium of the writ of injunction and have therefore deprived the citizens of the united states of the most sacred of all of our fundamental rightsthe right of trial by jury it had been my purpose in this argument to answer fully each of these assertions to controvert absolutely each of these three propositions but the limited time at my disposal and the necessity for an extended investigation of the provisions of the bill make it possible for me to refer only briefly to these declarations no more serious and dangerous error has been advanced in modern times than the proposition that the judicial power of the united states courts is a creation of the congress that the functions and power of our courts have their origin in or derive their vitality from the legislative branch of the government the dangerous and pernicious doctrine of these modern times which finds its pretext in the demand for the recall of judges and the recall of judicial decisions has its origin in this error no man who is familiar with the constitution of the united states and who is familiar with the historical facts that led to the adoption of that constitution can for a moment doubt the error of that contention the keystone of the arch of our constitutional government rests upon the absolute coordination and equality of its three great departmentsthe legislative executive and judicial the wise builders of that constitution taught in the school of experience in the stormy days that preceded it recognized the essential necessity for a complete separation between the judicial executive and legislative branches of the government and the superlative feature of that great instrument and that in which it differed essentially from any other government ever established was tise placing of the judicial power of the courts equal to and coordinate with the legislative and executive powers and that complete independence was accomplished by writing into the constitution in article iii section 1 this declaration the judichial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish etc the judicial power of our courts comes therefore from the constitution of the united states and not from congress it derives its existence and its authority from the same source from which comes our legislative power it is coordinate with and in all respects of equal potentiality to that power and while the constitution of the united states creates but one court and leaves to congress the power to ordain such inferior courts as may be necessary for the operation of the government it is a fundamental principle of legal construction established through a long line of judicial decisions and accepted as axiomatic that these courts when created and ordained derive their judicial power from the constitution and not from any act of congress creating them and therefore if it be found in the discussion of this bill that it seeksas i am convinced it doesto strike down a part of the judicial powers of the courts vested by the constitution the legislation proposed by this bill is entirely beyond our power to enact but it is impossible for me to dwell longer upon this point fundamental though it be for i must proceed hastily to declare that the second proposition of the proponents of this measure is equally vicious and equally without reason experience or facts to sustain it i refer to the assertion that the courts have abused their judicial power in the granting of injunctions that they have made the injunctive processes of the courts an instrument of oppression for convicting men of crimes without the right of trial by jury and have deprived them of their liberties without due process of law these assertions have been frequently made they have been made the basis of political agitation and have been industriously fomented to create a prejudice against our courts but i stand here to assert their falsity and to declare to this house that they have never been established by evidence i have been a member of the judiciary committee for six years during that whole period of time bills seeking to deprive the courts of this power have been pending before that committee extensive hearings have been given to those favoring this legislation as well as to those opposing it frequent demands have been made by the committee of those making these assertions to produce the evidence before the committee tosubstantiate them a few cases were presented and an analysisof them utterly failed to establish the truth of the assertions the fact is that the use of the injunction by the federal courts is rarely resorted to a careful examination of the records of the courts shows that from 1903 to 1912 only 25 injunctions were granted by the courts in labor cases against 447 in other cases in which no complaint of any kind was ever made and an analysis of the 25 cases in labor disputes demonstrates the fact that in every instance complete and impartial justice was done to both parties in the dispute in the exceptional use of this great preventive writ a writ absolutely essential to the administration of justice mistakes may sometimes have been made as they have been made and will be made in the future in every field of human instrumentality but the declaration upon which the necessity for this drastic legislation is based is not true and therefore has not been proven it is true that a few men in the history of the government have been punished by imprisonment for contempt of court for disobedience of the orders of the court in injunctive proceedings and it is true that sometimes the acts complained ofacfs which were employed in the violation of theinjunction of the courthave been crimes but ho man familiar with judicial decisions and with the laws as administered by the courts would dare declare that the punishment for contempts for violation of the orders of the court have been made an instrumentality for the punishment of crimes these crimes were a violation of state statutes over which the federal courts had no jurisdiction and the fact that the violation of the order of the court for which the punishment for contempt was inflicted incidentally involved a crime against the state authorities is made the pretext for formulating these monstrous and false accusations against the courts of the united states the whole argument to which i have referred is in effect an attempt to declare that the power of the court to protect the rights of the citizens of this country by the use of injunction should be denied and destroyed in certain classes of cases that the efficacy of the courts to protect civil and property rights by the strong arm of equity should be curbed and restrained and in this connection i desire to call the attention of the house to a statement made upon this subject by justice brewer of the supreme court of the united states in a public address made in brooklyn in november 1909 government by injunction has been an object of easy denunciation so far from restricting this power there never was a time when its restricted and vigorous exercise was worth more to the nation and for the best interests of all as population becomes more dense as business interests multiply and crowd each other the restraining power of a court of equity is of far greater importance than the punishing power of a court of criminal law thelbest scientific thought of the day is along the lines of prevention rather than those of cure we aim to stay the spread of opdemics rather than permit them to run their course and attend solely to the work of curing the sick and shall it be said of the law which claims to be the perfection of reason and to express the highest thought of the day that it no longer aims to prevent the wrong but limitsits action to the matter of punishment to take away the equitable power of restraining wrong is a step backward toward barbarism rather than forward toward a higher civilzation courts make mistakes in granting injunctions so they do in other orders and decrees shall the judicial power be taken away because of their occasional mistakes the argumenft would lead to the total abolition of the judicial function this is the publicly expressed opinion of one of the greatest and most conservative supreme court justices that has ever adorned the bench it is a brief but exhaustive summary of the efficacy and necessity of the writ of injunction and completely answers all of the populistic declarations of interested parties that for political reasons are urging its destruction but i must pass from the consideration of these great questions and direct my attention entirely to the consideration of the bill before us this bill is known as h r 23635 and was reported to the house on april 26 1912 by a majority report made by mr clayton chairman of the committee and a minority report in opposition to it representing practically the unanimous views of the minority which was filed on may 3 1912 the bill itself seeks to accomplish two purposes it first amends section 263 of the judicial code by substituting therefor the provisions of section 263 as provided in the pending bill it then proceeds to amend section 266 of the judicial code by adding thereto sections 266a 266b and 266c the alleged scope of the bill is therefore to regulate the granting of injunctions the power to grant injunctions is inherent in courts of equitable jurisdiction the power is not possessed by all courts but is an incident only of chancery jurisdiction and can be exercised only by courts clothed with that power or by legislative authorization it is power possessed by the courts of the united states and is derived from the constitution of the united states which by section 2 of article iii provides the judicial power of the united states shall extend to all cases in law or in equity arising under the constitution this inherent power of the federal courts to protect all of the citizens of the united states in the enjoyment of all of the rights secured to them by the constitution is therefore not bestowed by congress but is derived from the same high source that congress derives its power to exercise the function of legislation injunction is and always has been an extraordinary remedy to protect constitutional rights from invasion it is preventive rather than remedial and it can only be employed by the courts or the judges when it is necessary to prevent irreparable injury and when the complainant has no adequate remedy at law these two conditions must exist before any judge will grant an injunction every lawyer before me knows that this is elementary textbook law and that it is embodied in our jurisdiction by an unbroken line of judicial decisions but when these conditions do exist and when they are made known to the court or a judge by a proper presentation of facts then the federal power conferred upon our federal courts by the constitution of the united states in equity clothes them with a fundamental organic and inalienable power of protection which it is not within the power of congress to destroy now after these general observations i will proceed to a consideration of the bill before us and i shall direct my attentioai first to the proposed substitution of section 263 of the bill for section 263 of the existing judicial code and in doing this a few words of explanation respecting the origin of the proposed substituted section will be necessary and this in turn requires a brief explanation of the history of congressional legislation upon the subject of injunctions the original judiciary act of 1789 made no specific provisions for the granting of injunctions but by a general provision in that act power was given to the courts to permit special writs to meet special exigencies and whatever injunctions were issued prior to that time were based upon this section of the judicial act but on march 2 1793 a specific act relating to injunctions was passed by congress which is as follows no injunction shall be granted in any case without reasonable previous notice to the adverse party or his attorney of the time and place of moving for the same this act continued in force until 1872 when the existing law upon that subject was passed this act was carried into the recent judicial code of 1911 and now stands as section 263 of that code and is one of the sections that it is proposed to amend by the pending bill or by the first section thereof from the earliest days of the government down to 1872 notwithstanding the fact that the act of 1793 prohibited the granting of an injunction without notice to the adverse party or his attorney restraining orders were constantly used by the courts without notice whenever the exigencies of the case required it following the earlier practice of the english courts the distinction between restraining orders and injunctions was clearly recognized by the federal courts the statement of the majority of the committee in their relibrt that the will of congress as thus expressed was completely thwarted and the statute nullified by the peculiar construction placed upon it by the courts is wholly without foundation in fact this clearly recognized distinctive and necessary discrimination was acquiesced in by the entire bar of the country and one of the earliest cases arising under the act of 1793 arose in my own city of philadelphia before a court presided over by justice wilson of the supreme court who had himself been one of the most active and influential men in the framing of the constitution and it is a curious historical fact that the case was heard in a room in theold statehouse adjoining that in which the constitution of the united states had but a few years before been adopted the case is the one reported in 2 dallas page 360 schermerhorn v lespenasse in which a restraining order was issued to prevent the defendant from transferring a very large amount of the certificates of the bonded indebtedness of the united states or receiving the principal or interest thereon in violation of an agreement transferring the right to the same to the plaintiff schermerhorn in this early case as i have before stated the restraining order was issued without notice and was acquiesced in by mr lewis attorney for the defendant then one of the leading lawyers in the country who stated to the court that he understood that in this case and in a large number of other cases an injunction must be issued before a subpoena was served as there were various cases in which justice could not otherwise be obtained this practice of issuing restraining orders without notice i repeat was continued from the time of the passage of the act of 1793 down to the present time even chief justice marshall while sitting in circuit granted such orders to prevent irreparable mischief where there was no adequate remedy at law and it was universally recognized by the courts and by the bar that whenever a case was presented to a chancellor where the plaintiff was without adequate protection of law and where the injury sought to be restrained was irreparable and where the giving of notice to the defendant to make the application might of itself be productive of the mischief apprehended by inducing the defendant to accelerate the act in order that it might be complete before the time for making the application had arrived the chancellor must of necessity stretch forth the strong right arm of equity to prevent the mischief and that that power was inherent and organic and derived from the constitution of the united states which vested the courts with equitable power and was beyond the power of congress to deny or defeat i repeat that such was the state of the law until 1872 when the present law known as the carpenter act was passed which repealed the act of 1793 and became thereafter the federal law ubon the subject of injunctions this law is also very brief sec 718 now section 263 of the revised judicial code whenever notice is given of a motion for an injunction out of a circuit or district court the court or judge thereof may if there appears to be danger of irreparable injury from delay grant an order restraining the act sought to be enjoined until the decision upon the motion and such order may be granted with or without security in the discretion of the court or judge it will be observed that a rigid interpretation of the language of section 718 would require that the granting of a restraining order by the courts must be preceded by a notice to the defendant of the granting of a writ of injunction this was not the intention of the legislators nor was that construction ever placed upon it by the courts at the time of the passage of this act in the senate in 1872 the author of the bill mr carpenter publicly declared in his argument that his understanding of the powers of the courts to issue restraining orders in special cases could not be controlled by congress and this statement was acquiesced in by those who opposed the bill and i repeat that in all decisions rendered by the courts since that time down to the present the inherent right of the court to grant a restraining order without notice to prevent irreparable mischief when the exigencies of the case require it was never denied nor disputed by the bar or bench of the country and the courts continued to exercise this power to grant restraining orders without notice in a few cases where it was absolutely essential to protect civil and property rights but in recent years certain agitators attempted to foment public discontent among the masses by charging the courts with a violation of the strict letter of the law the agitation and the declarations of these promoters were entirely unjustifiable but the allegations were widely disseminated and resulted in occasional resentful denunciations of judges and courts of what was alleged to be an unwarranted abuse of judicial power president taft in his message to congress of december 1909 made the following recommendation i recommend that in compliance with the promise thus madereferring to theplatform of the republican convention of 1908appropriate legislation be adopted the ends of justice will best bs met and the chief cause of complaint against illconsidered injunctions without notice will be removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restraining order whether temporary or permanent by any federal court without previous notice 11912 i and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would result in irreparable injury to the complainant and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a written finding which shall be spread upon the court minutes that immediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue to the omplainant and shall define the injury state why it is irreparable and shall also indorse on the order issued the date and the hour of the issuance of the order moreover every such injunction or restraining order issued without previous notice and opportunity by the defendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix unless within such seven days or such less period the injunction or order is extended or renewed after previous notice and opportunity to be heard my judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies the best practice in equity and is very likely the rule now in force in some courts will prevent the issuing of illadvised orders of injunction without notice and will render shch orders when issued much less objectionable by the short time in which they may remain effective after the receipt of this message as i was at that time engaged on the subject of the revision of the judicial title of the federal statutes i took the matter up forthwith and prepared a bill which i submitted to the president and he gave it his hearty and unqualified approval this bill was widely published throughout the country with the presidents statement that he approved fully of all of its provisions and that he hoped it would be passed by congress without any alteration amendment or change whatever this bill was introduced in the sixtyfirst congress was referred to the judiciary committee but has never been reported therefrom this bill was again introduced in the present congress and was proposed in committee as a substitute for the pending bill and under the provisions of the rule under which this present discussion is proceeding will be offered to the house by the republican members as a substitute for the same this bill then introduced by a republican member and indorsed by president taft represents i believe the attitude of our party upon the subject of congressional regulation of injunctions it is substantially section 263 of the proposed bill with one single exception to which i shall alluade hereafter it does not in any material respect change the existing law with regard to injunctions it merely clothes the court with thelegal right to issue restraining orders without notice withdut resorting to the exercise of its inherent equitable powers to do so it defines the requisites that must appear to the court as a ground for issuing the restraining order without notice it requires the day of the issuance of the order to be indorsed upon it and requires the reason for its being granted without notice to be spread at large upon the record it requires by law the complainant to be reasonably vigilant in maintaining his right to the remedy he has invoked in other words it embodies in concrete legal form the actual practice of the judges of the federal courts almost invariably pursued by them in the granting of injunctions and does eliminate the danger of all 1lconsidered and injudicious restraints and erects an impregnable bulwark against the widely disseminated resentful but unwarranted denunciations of the courts and judges i repeat that this is i believe the attitude of the republican party upon this subject a willingness that they have at all times shown to assent to any rational proposal to properly safeguard the issuance of injunctions against even the possibility of abuse i repeat in order that it may be distinctly understood that this proposal is indorsed by the democratic members of fhis committee by their proposal in this bill to amend section 263 by this literal transcript of the moon bill with the exception before alluded to the minority members therefore practically support this section as before stated and will at the proper time move to substitute that section slightly amended for the proposed bill and will ask the house to join them in that proposition now the only material difference between the moon bill and section 263 of the pending bill to which i desire now to call your special attention is that the moon bill provides that the restraining order issued without notice shall expire seven days after it is servedupon the defendants section 263 provides that it shall expire not more than seven days after it is entered that is the vital distinction and it is vital why a restraining order is of no vitality until it is served it is as inocuous as the paper on which it is written it has no force it is not in existence as far as it has any effect as long as it is in the pocket of the officer or in the archives of the court it is a harmless and inocuous paper itself its vitality only comes into existence the moment it is served and if you are going to make a restraining order expire seven days after the entry the way to let an order expire is to evad the service and get outside the jurisdiction of the court therefore when any person has an idea that a restraining order is to be issued he may get out of the way and thus evade it that is the vital distinction between the two they point out the fact that the president recommended that it should expire seven days after entry they point out the fact that the clayton bill itself embodied the recommendation of the president i shall not attempt to state conversation between myself and the president but i prepared this bill containing this vital distinction it was submitted to the president he examined it carefully and gave out to the country the statement that he approved every word of that bill and hoped that it would forthwith be passed by congress therefore tile inference is irresistible that in that particular point when the presidents attention was called to it he approved without qualification this change from his original recommendation now i resume my discussion of the other section of this bill this section is defective only in the respect of which i have spoken and all that needs to be corrected is in that one essential particular and then it would be good law i want to repeat before i leave it that this provision introduces nothing new in the law but simply embodies in a statutory form the exact practice of all the federal judges in granting injunctions i now pass to a consideration of the other sections of this bill and desire to call the attention of the house to the fact that they are designed as amendments to a different section of the judicial code they propose three additional sections to be added to section 266 of that code they are numbered in order as section 266a section 266b and section 266c and they are intended as new substantive provisions of law what is section 266 it is not the general law relating to injunctions two hundred and sixtysix is what is known as the overman bill when we passed the interstate commerce act which among other things provided for the commerce court there was great agitation about the federal courts restraining the operation of a state law there was an effort made to absolutely prohibit the federal courts from prohibiting the operations of a state law that was discovered to be absolutely unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendment the states were absolutely prohibited from depriving people of the equal protection of the law and therefore whenever a state statute did that the united states courts must perforce have jurisdiction and restrain it what did we do we said by section 266 that whenever the application was made to the federal courts to restrain the operations of a state law one judge could not grant an injunction that there must be three judges sitting and one of them must be either a supreme court justice or a circuit court judge that is the law today that is all it is a regulation of injunctive power that is within the power of congress now this bill seeks to add three new sections to that one of them section 266a which at length says that no restraining order shall issue except upon the giving of security well i have not any objection to that i want to say that is nothing but an unnecessary reflection upon the fairness of the chancellors of the united states no single instance to establish its necessity ever was even hinted at before the committee i have never heard a statement in all this agitation that any court has failed to perform its duty in that respect the act of 1872 now section 263 gives discretion to do or not to do it no living man ever made a statement before our committee or anywhere else that the court had not always required security when it was necessary therefore this section is an unnecessary reflection against the judges but it is all right i do not object to it the next one is 266b and let me call attention to that for a few minutes it says that every order of injunction or restraining order shall set forth the reasons for the issuance of the same shall be specific in terms and shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the bill of complaint or other document the act or acts sought to be restrained and it also further provides and this is to me the dangerous part of it and shall be binding only upon the parties to the suit their agents servants employees and attorneys or those in active concert with them and who shall by personal service or otherwise have received actual notice of the same first of all the issuance of injunction and the requisites of a n injunction are essentially regulated by the equity rules of the united states courts it has been said indeed in the majority report that there is no hvw today requiring any particular form for an iijunctibn our equity practice for nearly 60 years has been regulated by enactingl a few fundamental principles and then leaving all the details of the pvvctice to the rules of the supreme court of the united states these rules and regulations have therefore the authlority of law every lawyer here who practices in a supreme o irt knows that the supreme court rules prescribe the essentials 64 i8 of an injunction no judge draws an injunctive order to suit his own will or his own caprice therefore every single order is regulated by law today now i call attention of the majority side of this house to the fact that these rules forbid in an injunctive order unnecessary recitals the object of every injunctive order is to make clear what the parties restrained have to do or what they must not do any injunctive order that does not do that so clear that the wayfaring man though a fool could not err therein can not be held and never has been held to be properly drawn or to be of any legal force or effect but these rules do say that a man shall not restate in that order the recitals of the bill that you must state what the man must or must not do why you confuse any man by making a restraining order if you do not do that the existing practice absolutely requires that everything shall not go in now bear in mind the uselessness of this provision the first section already providesthat is one of the things provided in section 263 one of the things recommended by the presidentthat the judge when he grants the restraining order without notice should write in the record the kind of injury he was going to guard against and say why it was irreparable and why he granted it without notice that is already provided for to be entered in the record of the court now why provide for a useless repetition in the injunctive order of the court when it can only confuse the person sought to be restrained now i propose to pass very briefly upon the next paragraph of this section as there are other gentlemen who will speak about it i refer to the paragraph which limits the persons to be bound by the injunction the gentleman from illinois in his query to the chairman of the committee indicated by his question what everybody here has in mindthat the object of this bill plainly is intended to limit the scope of the injunction to somebody named in it or somebody known to the complainant at the time it is issued somebody who at some time happens to be in active concert with them but the intention of the injunction is to restrain an irreparable injury to restrain an injury that can not be compensated for by law to restrain every person under all conditions and under all circumstances that can be reached by a court of equity from doing the thing prohibited now under the attempt to limit it by this legislation to known persons or to persons in active concert with them you are going to minimize to narrow and in some instances to destroy that power"]],

offered by the gentleman from new jersey ought to have gone on the original act he was assured in the senate he was assured in the debate that the act could not apply to labor organizations because every man had the inalienable right to control the price of his own labor and to control the price of the product of his own labor but the supreme court in construing this act disagreed with the majority members of the committee mr sherman and mr edmunds and agreed with senator george from my own state to wit that this amendment should have gone on the bill there is a right interesting bit of history when this matter was passed on in the senate senator george of mississippi was sick and unable to be present or he would have offered on the floor of the senate the amendment in substantially the language that the gentleman from new jersey has drawn it and"], [0.00018209218978881836, 0.5001820921897888, 0, "i certainly would like to have the gentleman from texas accorded some time it wil

and requires the director of the census to collect and publish twice a yearin april and octoberstatistics of the quantity of unmanufactured leaf tobacco in all forms in the possession of all dealers and manufacturers who have in the preceding year manufactured as much as 50 000 pounds of tobacco 250 000 cigars or 1 000 000 cigarettes penalties are attached for refusal or failure to make the reports called for by the bill for the purpose of compiling statistics there can be no doubt that the uncertainty that exists each year concerning the stocks of tobacco in the hands of the american tobacco co and other large manufacturers plays into their hands and seriously handicaps the farmers in the matter of planting and marketing their crops the publication of official statistics in the spring and fall would put the farmers in much better position to gauge their crops and the market outlook and we believe mr cantrills bill odght to be passed the report of the hearings on the proposed tobaccostatistics law before the house committee on the census is exceedingly interesting and mr cantrill seems to have made an earnest and forceful effort in behalf of the measure the burden of his argument was that the government compiles statistics about the acreage of tobacco the progress of the crop during the growing season estimates of the product when it is cut and housed and other information that is of great value to the manufacturers in giving them a line on the tobacco in sight but the growers have no way of estimating the stocks held by the manufacturers which is a matter of tremendous importance when the great bulk of the entire production in certain types is bought by a single concern which practically fixes prices the committee on the census after listening to arguments in behalf of the cantrill bill authorized the following favorable report just before the recent adjournment and the measure has been put on the house calendar to be called tip at the regular
