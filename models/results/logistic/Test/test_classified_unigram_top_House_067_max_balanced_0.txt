to stop the issuance of taxexempt securities congress now has the power if it deems it wise today to provide taxation of these securities in every manner they wish except one what is that the issuance by the states themselves of their securities and exempting them from taxation i repeat the statement i made awhile ago whether it be wise or unwise i venture the assertion that when you face the bald proposition that you will amend the constitution of the united states so that congress can tax the bonds issued by the sovereign state of illinois or the sovereign state of new yorkthat is the income from these bondsor that the congress of the united states can tax the income on bonds issued for the erection of a schoolhouse in iowa by a school district those bonds to be retired by taxes levied by the people themselves on their own property in their dlgtricts i say when you face that proposition i do not believe you will get a dozen thoughtful levelheaded republicans much less democrats to invade the local rights to that extent and if you did do it gentlemen do you think you are going to get the requisite number of states to permit the congress of the united states the taxlevying agency of the federal government to have unlimited exercise of the taxing power which as has been well said time and time again is the power to destroy i sax do you believe you are going to get the legislatures of the requisite number of states to make that step in surrendering the rights of states and municipalities to a centrally organized power at the seat of the federal government now my object in calling attention to that is this if it be wise to stop the issuance of so many taxexempt securities do not meet that demand with an evasive proposition like this if this administration and this congress think it is wise to stop the issuance of taxfree securities then the example for us to set when we authorize the secretary of the treasury to issue united states bonds is to say that we will make the income from them subject to taxation but gentlemen you are not going to do that so why try to deceive anybody why try to deceive these people who are advocating this you have not advocated that of course the advocacy of it by some people indicates that they are either totally ignorant of the philosophy of our dual system of government or else that they have a perfect contempt for our institutions and wish to overthrow them and set up instead a government totally different from that which was founded by the fathers if you want to start correcting this alleged evil why did this congress during its life in some instances grant tax exemption to private corporations when engaged in foreign business if you are sincere in saying to the country through your president and

the department men got leave for them to sell it in the argentine something that was not contemplated when they undertook to help them get it out of the argentine now about this 1centapound profit the object of having two companies in this was because under the lever act no company was permitted by the regulations of the attorney general to make more than 1 cent a pound on sugar but in order to get 2 cents a pound they had two companies here and that is the only company in the united states that did that and the only time that arrangement was made for that profit i will tell you what they went into they went into a deal to make over a million dollars out of the importing of sugar into the united states who were they that went into this deal if you pass this bill to whom do you pay it you will pay it to the biggest sugar raiser in the world mr post who is mr post he is the biggest sugar refiner in the world he raises sugar in cuba as the hearings disclose and is president of the biggest sugarproducing concern in the world he ships his sugar to new jersey and refines it and distributes it and the hearings disclose that before this deal was made his company had sold to the people of this country more sugar than any other man in the world at a bigger price than was ever paid for sugar in the united states of america that is the man for whose benefit you are taking money out of the treasury oh they say one reason for voting for this bill is that the money has not got into the treasury yet they say that mr glasgow is holding it until congress gets through and he can give it to post reilly another oneof these deputy attorney generals testified before the committee several times 1le says glasgow is doing that for a fee i said surely not an attorney for the sugar equalization board for a private fee would not appear here and try to get us to pay this claim oh yes he said he does not care about that why when he was attorney for the board be took a fee over in pennsylvania to tight the law and question its constitutionality that is in the record and undisputed since that time we have invited the sugar equalization board to come before the committee and tell us where they stand and what they were doing and with reference to the other claims let me tell you something that happened the other day a business man came down from new jersey who has identically the same arrangement with the government that these people had only he got a lot of sugar into this country and sold it he claims he had something to do with breaking the market the gentleman from kentucky asked him why he did not file his claim with congress a long time ago well lie said he had a talk with post and post said you wait until i get my claim through and then we can all get in he said that he read in the hearings what post said that his was about the only claim and he read what glasgow said and that that was the only claim and he then went to post and said i am going to file my claim in washington i heard a member of the agricultural committee say to another one if we dont hurry up there will be hundreds of these claims there might as well be 5 000 with as much merit let me tell you something i am not going to claim that the lobby that has been here in behalf of this claii is corrupt but what is the lobby post is a man of influence a man of wealth a man of standing the biggest sugar dealer in the world i got a letter from a wholesale sugar man in my district and he wanted me to vote for the sugar claims there he was way out there in that district and i wondered what lie knew about it i went home last february and dropped in and i said john how did you happen to write me a letter to vote for the sugar claims you dont know anything about them he said i told the girl when i wrote the letter that you would have too much sense to pay any attention to it he said i had to do it because it is necessary that i have my standing as long as i am in the wholesale business that is the class of letters that you get asking you to vote for these claims if you are going to pay moral obligations some of them have a more moral backing than this this is the worst claim in the bunch why is it the worst claim in the bunch because the man that imported this sugar made more money out of sugar in 1920 than any other organization or man in the world go home to your people and tell them that you paid that man that produced more sugar in 1920 than any man in the world when you were paying 20 cents a pound and you paid him three and a half million dollars because on his last shipment he lost a little moneygo home and tell them that and see how it sounds talk about moral obligation i have pretty nearly reached the conclusion that war is what sherman said it was there is not a wholesale sugar man in the united states but that when the drop came had sugar on his hands and lost money there is not a retail sugar mau in the united states but that when tile drop came had sugar on his hands and lost money on that sugar there is not a sugar producer in the united states but what some tinie when the deflation came lost money reimburse them because somebody has

principles laid by those men who framed this constitution that says we ought to take the right away froln tle people back home to decide whether or not they will have a brick highway of 14 or 18 or 20 foot width or whatever it may be now t want to came back to the figures supposing we could build n mile of federal highway for 25 000 that is the contract price i do not care what the material is i am going to show you what it will cost ohio and the other big taxpaying states in the union that is under the supposition that every state will get a mile of road if every state gets a mile and the contractors bid 25 000 a mile here is what it will cost ohio tie contract price is 25 000 the amount that the state government will receive under this bill from tie federal government is 12 500 onefourteenth of which cwime from the state itself onefourteenth is 900 how do i figure that why i subtract the amount that ohio pays herself into that federalaid fund or 900 that comes back to her and that lnakes the ohio state aid per mile 11 600 but all the otler 47 states each get 12 500 per mile or a total of fortyseven times 12 500 which is 587 500 ohio pays on1efourteenth of that or 41 968 which must be added to her cost of 25 000 contract price less 11 600 federal aid which lakes olios 25 000 road cost 55 368 but the taxipayers only get a 25 000 road suppose we take the actual figures of road cost in ohio instead of theoretical figures of 25 000 per mile let us take 40 000 which is a fair average alld suppose that ohio would pay to the contractors 40 000 for a mile of federal higllway the state of olio would receive 11 600 from the federal government none of which comes from the taxpayers but in order to get thlat 11 600 federal aid the state is compelled to levy a tax of 41 968 o1 its citizens in order to assist the various other states in their roadbuilding program now if you will subtract the 11 600 from the 40 000 supposed cost the road would cost ohio 28 400 but in order to be fair you must add to that 28 400 the 41 968 which must le given away in order to get the 11 600 and you will find that every mile of 40 000 federal highway built in ohio costs the taxpayers of that state 70 368 or alhost twice as much as it should if my colleagues in congress believe in that kind of a principle and unjust discrimination and taxation should be fastened on the american people at this time when everybody is crying out against the enormous federal taxes of course they will indicate that belief by voting for a continiation of this proposition i want some of my colleagues who vote to tax tie ohio citizen 70 368 for a 40 000 road to explain to me their mathematics it is no justification to say that ohio gets five or six million dollars a year for harbor facilities and it is no justification to say that ohio hlas to pay her slare of the arhny and navy and tihat ohio has her share of the soldiers because every state in the union has its soldier pensions and to tiose states which do not get any appropriation for harbor facilities it can be said that almost every one of them have had some kind of a reclamation scheme that has cost the governmeat more money than all the harbor development in oh io the statement made on the iloor that ohio got back all the money she paid into the federal treasury only serves to illustrate the carelessness with which some men make statemen ts as the actual figures compiled will show that the citizenship of ohio does not get back 20 cents on the dollar i would have no complaint to make if every state in the union bore fie same burden of taxation but i do think it unfair to tax the citizenship of my state to build roads that are not needed for a military necessity or an economic development in some other commonwealth than ohio you may call that position provincial if you will but so long as reduction of the taxes is flhe prime interest of everyhody and the aim of every man in public life i shall continue to try to get a dollars worth of service for my people for every dollar i vote to put on them in the way of taxation now let 1s look at new york and see what it costs her to build a 25 000 per mile road under federal construction by the same process of reasoning as was used in the case of ohio new york would get 9 400 from the federal government for her 25 000 mile of road leaving the amount to be raised by local taxation at 15 600 but to get thie 9 400 new york would have to tax her people 146 875 to give away to the other states in the union for their 25 000 road making new yorks mile of road actually cost her taxpayers 162 475 suppose qat the mile of road that new york builds costs 40 000 instead of 25 000 from 40 000 subtract the 9 400 federal aid that leaves 30 600 add that to the amount she has to give away 146 875 and you have the cost of the 40 000 mile of highway in new york at 177 475 i do not believe the taxpayers of the state of new york are willing to have their citizenship taxed at the rate of 177 475 per mile for a 40 000 mile of road in the face of the strenuous efforts that governor miller has made in the past two years to relieve the tax burden of the already oppressed people i say again of course if thero were any military or economic necessity for this the citizens of new york would respond without a murunlr but in tiles of peace and under tihe burdens resulting from a great war i think they are justified in crying out against this added burden the united states now has a debt of approximately 25 000 000 000 new yorks
