be one of the most important votes we make this year what saddens me most is that this legislation is only the first of several pieces that will be before the congress this year to further increase the debt limit admittedly these are only socalled temporary increases but they are very real increases on which interest amounting to billions of dollars a year must be paid i was also quite disappointed that no attempt was made to work out a compromise on the senate language added to this legislation which would have set a federal budget expenditure ceiling the statement was made in this chamber monday afternoon that the senate language was not adequate what i cannot understand is why the conferees did not attempt to change the language so it would be adequate i have always assumed and i certainly hope my assumption is not erroneous that the job of the conferees is to work out a compromise between the differing language of the two bodies and when possible to improve upon these differences i would certainly think that this should be the paramount objective of the conferees when the purse strings of america are involved we periodically debate legislation such as we have under consideration this afternoon to place our great nation even further into debt at the expense of the taxpayersthe people we represent yet we never seem to offer any alternatives whereby the federal budget can be held in check or alternatives to reduce the federal debt rather than constantly adding to it i further submit that it is only a subterfuge to say that we are approving only a temporary increase in the debt ceiling the people of america fortunately can see through this subterfuge i feel it is time we were honest with ourselves and our constituents and admit that temporary increases

hope the committee approves it let me talk a minute if i might about the other legislation that my friend the gentleman from louisiana mentioned i i think we have to differentiate between this amendment and the emergency school aid amendment which will be offered by the gentleman from illinois mr pucrnskr the emergency school aid bill is aimed at helping those school districts primarilythat are under court order to bus for the attainmeat of racial balance the purpose of the legislation is to provide federal funds to assist those school districts that through no fault of their own have to take action in conformity with a court order it is equity and justice on the part of the federal government to provide that financial assistance i am interested in the best education that we can get at the elementary and secondary level the best way in this emergency to obtain that best education is to provide federal financial assistance rather than to force busing forced busing to attain racial balance is not the best way to get good education let me illustrate in my hometown of grand rapids mich we have for example a pupilteacher ratio of 25 students to one teacher in my judgment it would be far wiser to spend the money that we might spend for busing to reduce the pupilteacher ratio it should be 8 to 1 or 7 to 1 it is a far wiser expenditure to use that money for the lowering of the pupilteacher ratio the emergency school aid bill will accomplish that objective 1 5 billion will accomplish that i happen to think it is far wiser timewise for kids to be in their neighborhood schools rather than to spend a lot of time traveling from their home to a school which may be 3 4 5 or 10 miles away for that reason i am strongly in support of the emergency school aid bill it is a case of

july 1 1971 i introduced house joint resolution 765 which affirms that all military assistance and all sales and deliveries of military equipment and weapons to pakistan and all licenses for military sales including those already approved shall be suspended for a period of 365 days unless the president determines that such assistance sales or deliveries are required for reasons of overriding national interest and so reports to the congress senator mathias will introduce similar legislation in the other body today as a joint resolution this legislation will not only convey the sense of congress it will also have the force of law it is important that members understand the urgent need for rapid action on this resolution an editorial in the july 5 washington post traces the background of our policy regarding arms deliveries to pakistan from my understanding of this editorial several points of interest regarding my resolution emerge first the department of state until late june 1971 was convinced that following the eruption of civil war in east pakistan on march 25 1971 the united states had been able to bring to a halt all arms deliveries to pakistan second on the strength of this conviction the department of state repeatedly and formally stated to the congress and the press that no arms had been or were being provided to pakistan on or after march 25 1971 third in all likelihood without the knowledge of administration officials at the policy level on may 8 1971 the sonderbaus a pakistani ship carrying arms still in the supply pipeline as of march 25 1971 set sail for pakistan from new york fourth on june 22 a second pakistani ship carrying unitedstates arms still in the supply pipeline set sail for pakistan from new york at this point solid investigative reporting by the new york times uncovered the existence of the supply pipeline loophole fifth on july 2 a third pakistani ship carrying supply pipeline arms left new york for pakistan sixth four to five more ships are scheduled to leave in july and august and even then no one can be certain tne supply pipeline will be unclogged and exhausted by its decision still in force to suspend further arms sales to pakistan i believe the united states demonstrated that it was adopting the only policy appropriate for an outside power with respect to the tragic civil war in east pakistan namely a policy of neutrality noninterference and noninvolvement in my judgment the important step which we had to take from the standpoint of our military sales policy was this halt in all further sales but we cannot at the same time ignore the diplomatic and political significance of the pipeline deliveries in an article in the new york times former ambassador to india chester bowles warns on july 6 of the possible sequence of events which may soon confront us it is first india in a desperate effort to cut off the flow of refugees return the present refugees to their own homes and prevent the establishment of an extreme leftwing government in east pakistan may move troops into east pakistan second pakistan may then be expected to reply by attacking india in kashmir and the indian punjab third china may deliver an ultimatum to india fourth the soviet union may then support india to ward off china and the escalation may continue in this scenario which ambassador bowles believes is a very real possibility could the united states ultimately avoid involvement i believe the minimal step which the united states must take is to halt all arms deliveries to pakistan including those deliveries in the supply pipeline which have not left our shores with each one of our actions we must convey conviction that we favor an immediate standdown in the level of violence in east pakistan in spite of our hopes that the strife will soon end and thus permit the united states to avoid some of these painful policy decisions the july 6 new york times reported that bengali insurgents have now knocked out the dacca electrical power station this suggests that resistance is far from ended it may continue for months perhaps years i insert the washington post editorial and ambassador bowles
