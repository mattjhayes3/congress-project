for congressional approval of the commitment of american men and money to the defense of the middle east let me say that i expect to vote to sustain his request in view of the fact that he already has that authority under our constitution as commander in chief of the defenses i hope that our expression of unity on this floor may convince the kremlin of the wisdom of desisting from a policy of attempting to extend the iron curtain to the vital international crossroads that is the suez canal and the small nations adjacent thereto in so voting i would remind the american people as well as the distinguished members of the house that the implementation of the eisenhower doctrine with its unpredictable complications can only come at the price of sacrifice here at home and the application of fundamental safeguards in its administration involved in this tremendous undertaking is the national solvency of the united states once we have lost our fundamental economic soundness through illadvised international largesse we have lost our position as leader of the free world this house must sustain the desire of the president to implement with deeds the words of the state department but let each member of this body remember that our obligation to the general welfare of america and americans is one of vigilant observation over each step of the way in making the eisenhower doctrine a mighty instrument in the cause of world peace hamlet pushed to the brink of decision soliloquized as follows to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrseous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them like the tragic hamlet it has come about that this nation is faced with a similar decisiona time when we must make up our collective mind whether we shall suffer longer the gradual erosion of our world position at the hands of a persistently serpentine communist dictatorship or by adopting a middle east declaration of purpose keep the vital suez canal and oilrich lands of the eastern mediterranean littoral from communist control through a combination of words fortified by deeds from time to time in the history of our republic we find ourselves at a crossroads perplexed and beset by doubts as to our proper course such a time arose in the years of the late 1700s we resolved our doubts hardened our resolution and armed largely with courage and a great faith gave the world the declaration of independence implemented eventually by the vibrant provisions of a constitution for free men and women who have lived by it now for exactly ninescore years now our mysterious destiny has brought us again to the challenge of another great decision that decision presents itself in simple terms as the fundamental proposition whether christian civilization exemplified by the great nations of the west whose cultural foundations are based solidly in the hellenic ideal of freedom of the individual is to survive against its great and mortal enemythe doctrine of communist imperialism whose product of atheistic materialism has resulted from the veneer of a pseudoscientific approach to history forcibly imposed upon a way of life and a culture oriental in concept the train of the past decade carries in it the sad and dolorous account of the death of nations and the death of peoples no literate person can fail to know of the steady encroachment of communism across the face of the world as its handmaidens this new and terrifying imperialism mirroring the worst atrocities of ghengis khan deals in death of individuals deaths of entire races extermination of classes and the total subjugation of entire nations to its monolithic despotism in the free and clear atmosphere of this republic we naturally ask the apparent question why has it been so what mortal ailment brought on the pick and merciless death at the hands of the satrapy of lenin the answer is obvious these nations that have died were in the main the small the weak the instable communities where communist witcheries seized upon minor flaws in the body politic and with all the savagery of burrowing shrews quickly devoured that which they had penetrated we now have come to a point where we must consider the instant case of the middle eastern nations we must assume at the outset that those nations cannot standing alone resist either the economic blandishments of communist russia nor its military might thus the question faces us squarely as it did hamlet if communist russia is to be halted in its steady encroachment further upon the preserves of freedom it must be stopped by first economic aid from this nation as leader of the free world and economic aid of such character and distribution to give the lie to totalitarian claims that we are but another in the long colonial history of oppression and class distinctions based upon color our second choice the companion piece of the first is the definite commitment that our deeds in the fields factories and market places shall be bolstered with the solemn promise to reinforce the military might of the threatened weak with the ready strength of our military establishment a look at the harsh realities of the middle east situation spells out a sinister pattern of future communist expansion unless we strengthen mr eisenhowers hand in countermeasures to further prevent depredations of the communist spoilers communist china craves the great food basket of the fertile ricerich southeast asian area russia boldly desires acting upon the taut and harried emotions of nasser to cut off the flow of vital mideast oil to the free world and to strangle its artery of commerce through the suez canal the accomplishment of these two aims actively sought at both ends of the moscowpeiping axis would effectively seal the fate of the free portion of western europe through denial of fuel oil and asian raw materials by the same token further expansion of communist china would constitute a mortal peril to the united states and its increasing reliance upon rubber tungsten tin and growing commerce with the nations of the vast pacific ocean area there is another aspect to the problem far beyond oil raw materials and the complexities of political fundaments this face of a dark mirror reflects itself to us in the features of underlying differences of race religion and culture in our resolve to extend the influence of american thought and assistance to disturbed and fearful peoples thousands of milies beyond our twin shores we shall encounter a full measure of spiritual opposition to our christian doctrine an opposition long ago encountered by our early missionaries and teachers who penetrated these lands there will be active resistance to our way of life in a cultural sense from peoples whose basic civilization differs strangely and wonderfully from the truths we live by it is my sincere hope that the implementation of the eisenhower doctrine will take into consideration this important aspect of extending our willing assistance to those whose freedom is threatened upon this one point i dare to venture the opinion that our entire structure of aid to the mideast can collapse ignominiously if sensitivity and diplomacy are not employed in applying the broad principles laid down so ably by mr eisenhower on january 5 1957 let us now turn from the region of sand and oil and survey our situation here at home as it relates to mr eisenhowers program and what he asks this congress to give him with the approval of the eisenhower doctrine by the congress three vital and reasonable questions arise first will this declaration in itself serve sufficient warning to the kremlin to deter overt aggression economic or military second can our european and middle eastern allies be depended upon to shoulder the necessary effort to enable the western world to secure and maintain the balance of power and third what can we expect to be the eventual cost to the american economy in resources manpower and free democratic government as to the first question we have every reason to assume the president and his military advisers lean to the opinion that the doctrine will prevent any overt attempt by the kremlin to initiate armed conflict either direct or indirectly through actions by any of her satellites knowing as they must that unleashed atomic warfare with its staggering chaos will result judging from russias recent actions in arming egypt and syria we can only interpret her course as a means of activating and satisfying communist sympathy and influence in areas where explosive local disturbances give promise of creating conditions of anarchy which favor her infiltration designs in relation to the second question we find that the great and vital area of the world where the doctrine will apply is one where an appalling prevailing poverty an astounding general illiteracy and greedy and opportunistic politicians all combine to afford communism a rich though redolent breeding ground any tender of american economic aid subject solely to the discretion and i might say capricious whims of local politicians cannot only defeat our end purpose of restoration of stability and freedom but may in due course be diverted to the advantage of our mortal and desperate enemythe world communist conspiracy we have no assurance at the moment that we can expect totally disunited national groups to resist their quisling elements who for the sake of power expressed in terms of the hope of personal reward will sell themselves and their whole peoples into the strands of a web woven upon moscows master pattern by red agents and propagandists however these are as the military men put it calculated risks we must chart our course under the eisenhower doctrine with these shoals and white water plainly marked for all to comprehend and thus to avoid when we look at the past record of aid in western europe we must reluctantly concur with critics that high hopes and fervent aspirations upon our part to secure for the present and future a free world safe and peaceful have not met with the originally anticipated success we had planned for the great concourse of aid from this country to europe which has flowed unceasingly since 1945 along military economic and cultural lines has not generated the abundant coordinated effort we had hoped for as a specific remedy for the disease of spreading russian imperialism thus while our effort in nato has not measured up to our hopes i think we can still point with some satisfaction to an american airlift to berlin that maintained the western line american might and the upbuilding of our military strength across the atlantic in close concert with our allies was sufficient to maintain a status quo against a rampant and surging communist ambition coldly out to dominate the globe taken in the light of our firm measures in europe i feel that the mideast doctrine will work since in that area we deal primarily with simple economies and with populations where political force lines run clearly along religious and racial planes when we come to the third question which the eisenhower doctrine poses we find that history gives us no aid and comfort in assessing the future there is no yardstick of past experience habit or thought for use in measuring this undertaking its initial breadth and scope is in the light of our postworld war ii economic aid and succor to others comparatively small it is only when we view it in the light of budgets still to be drafted appropriations yet unvoted and permissive legislation to be submitted for approval of our successors in this house that we must wrestle truly with our consciences and search out the crannies of our intellects for sufficient justification to so commit the might of america the third question thus generates its own brood of questions can we continue to indulge our economic production as at present if we give our solemn vow to stand up as the free world champion against tyranny on this vital battlefield can our economy stand the possible future immense drain upon it if the extremity comes and we find that the desert of sinai where there is a place called armageddon becomes our strong outer bastion for the defense of our north american cities can we stand a little more inflation to pay for this great plan can our basic resources financial stability savings pensions private insurance social security structure and the other great aspects of our complex national system stand this new and unpredictable burden can our tax structure as presently constructed pay for this it will one day come home to members of a future congress that the shouting and tumult of foreign military and economic aid while exciting are like the iceberg only a bare onesixth of the total menace the time may come god forbid when we shall be faced with an historic dilemma which came as a classic european example to the last bourbon of france in 1789whether we have repudiation of our public obligations or revolution in our streets by impoverished citizens who ultimately find themselves working solely for the allpowerful state these are the imponderables involved in the mideast doctrine it is my conviction that the good sense of the american people who have but to know the truth to act upon it in times of emergency will solve these spontaneous issues born of the necessity of selfpreservation through the preservation of the middle east as an area friendly to the western world even though that friendship shall have been cemented with a generous proffered gift these are less evil and horrible than the twilight of the human race in the shadows of a nuclear war i am in no sense an isolationist i detest the term in that as a communicant of a christian church i believe that no man lives alone nor is he as the poet has put it an island entire in the sea of humanity what happens to others in some measure affects me our reluctant conclusion must be that destiny and the course of events has forced us to a declaration of policy in the torn and vexed middle east we all know that there is a time and place in the affairs of men and nations when the time for indecision has passed the hard choice is the only choice the only alternative to reality is an eventual selfdestruction hamlet fell prey to the confused tortured and perplexing dilemma of failing to make his decision preferring instead to dwell in the agonizing nightmare world of what might have been had he faced up to the realities at elsinore as a brutal consequence he was doomed shakespeares play gave us a great and immortal theatrical drama it also provided an enduring parable of men applicable also to nations since men in the mass make up national entities i shall vote for the eisenhower doctrine knowing as i vote that it entails sacrifice and a great expression of national unity it is my hope that the other distinguished members of the house vote with me knowing in advance of their vote that we are standing now at the threshold of a decision as grave as any
