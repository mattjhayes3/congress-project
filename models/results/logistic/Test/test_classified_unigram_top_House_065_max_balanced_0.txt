increasing demand for authoritative information regarding domestic industry and domestic commerce at present the census of manufactures is the only comprehensive and authoritative statement which we have for many industries fault is often found with the circumstance that perhaps inevitably the results of the census of manufactures are not published until they no longer refer to current conditions this difficulty was overcome in a measure with respect to the census of 1914 by publication of a preliminary abstract unless the census of manufactures agriculture mines and quarries is taken in 1920 we are very likely to le without information of very great importance whether the country is then at war or has entered upon a period of peace it seems beyond question that there will be under consideration questions of the highest importance with respect to adjustment of industries the condition of agriculture etc according to our point of view it would be extremely unfortunate if when these questions come forward for consideration we were not in possession of the data which would normally be collected as of 1920 even if it is assumed that war will be continuing in 1920 we should hope that man power permitting the census would be taken in order that its data might be available to show the changes which have occurred in industries and to indicate the relative rehabilitation

the secretary of war in which lie stated that the order had been revoked during the last discussion of the matter the gentleman from texas mr brantoni interrupted me and said this i want to commend the gentleman for getting this order of gen buck out of the way and i want to ask him if he would not go further and get the other regulation out of the way that makes a distinction between the private soldier and the officer in allowing the officer to give social attention to our nurses in uniform and forbidding the private soldiers to do likewise that statement of the gentleman from texas excited laughter in the house laughter of incredulity and indeed i myself was inclined to smile at it because i did not dream that it had been well made or was founded upon actual facts but i have today received a letter which is a verification of the statement made by the gentleman from texas i received this morning an anonymous letterof course all public men receive them occasionally usually they are abusivebut we know they are from cowards and we pay no attention to them but this letter was written on the stationery of the y m c a at camp gordon and was signed a committee of soldiers and though no names were signed to it i know they were not cowards for i understand why they could not sign their names i am going to read it to the house camip goron ga february 9 1919 hon george huddlesto al c washington d 0 dear sin your speech of january 28 rapping at the system of caste in the army is certainly to the point and at the right time at present down here in camp gordon there is an order to the same effect issued by the colonel commanding the base hospital stating that nurses female are not to speak to enlisted men if only some more membtrs of congress would only keep up the good work that you are doing to eliminate the caste system from the army it is no wonder there is bolshevism in this worldit was just that same caste that caused a revolution in russia the only way to keep the soldiers from becoming socialists is to do away with that caste your good work in congress is certainly appreciated by the soldiers a few more men with your good judgment would certainly help the soldiers respectfully yours acmitc o odes i can understand how soldiers would not care to write even to a member of congress a letter to the slightest degree reflecting upon the officer class particularly their own commanding officer because we all know well what would happen to those soldiers had they signed their names and the matter become known to the commanding officer it is a shame to the spirit of our army and violative of true american ideals that brave men serving their country as soldiers should be forced to resort to anonymous letters in order to present their grievances but we all know what the situation is these soldiers did not dare to sign their names this letter verifies the statement made by the gentleman from texas the other day and i believe such an order has been posted at camp gordon i am hoping that if it is not true the army authorities will take occasion to deny that as they did the statemeat of tile order at camp mcarthur this is a very trifling matter in itself it amounts to little as i said the other day but it bespeaks the spirit of the army now we know that the private soldier is just as mnuch a gentleman as the officera gentleman in the true sense of the wordas brave kind selfsacrificing and true for those are the qualities of the real gentleman we all know that these nurses could well afford to associate with enlisted men and we all know that the reason for this order is the contamination which it was feared that these women would suffer from such associationwas social contamination so that thereafter they would not be good enough for the officers to mix with socially the purpose of the order was to build up a wall around them and say to the enlisted men this is our private preserve you shall not trespass thereon it is a part of patriotism not to indulge in time of war in general criticism of our army but even in time of war just and proper criticism which will raise its standards and will give to it a higher morale certainly would be justified but let us remember that the war is over and this is in time of peace there is nothing sacred about the army it is merely one of the institutions of our country of course i know the milltarists would like even in times of peace to have us bow our faces in the dust as the army goes by and to salute a man wearing straps on his shoulders with reverence and awe that is the spirit but that is no part for the patriot it is rather a part for another individual whom i do not like to name in this house but now is a time of peace and it seems to me we ought to correct these evils that we recognize as being in our army a strange thing about it is that those who seem to desire that the army shall be regarded as sacrosanct and that a man should reverently take off his hat when he goes into its presence have little respect for some of our other institutions that class has no respect for congress they have not even respected congress while the war was on they have not feared they would break down the morale of congress but more than ever have they taken advantage of the opportunity to point out the faults and the mistakes of congress and its members congress certainly is higher and should be more exempt from criticism than the army we are here as the representatives of the american people chosen by their suffrage and have some small dignity because of our representative capacity but the army has no such position it is merely a collection of individuals brought together for a certain purpose and in time of peace its duties are not nearly so important as the duties of many other people i would rather have respect for the great army of american workingmen going each day with the rising of the sun with little tin buckets in their hands to do a days honest work and to bring home some wages to feed their wives and childreni would rather look upon the labor of america as a great and worthy institution before which every patriotic citizen would take off his hat and bow in respect i would rather regard any class of people following any kind of peaceful occupation producing something doing something that is worth while going to and fro in the world engaged in commerce in the practice of a profession in doing something that is useful to mankind or which adds to the beauty or welfare of the worldi would rather regard any of those occupations with respect than the soldiers occupation in time of peace let us lay aside any thought that we may have that the army is above criticism it is not whether soldiers are generals or privates they are men like you and me many of the officers are engaged in the business merely as a profession which is a loafing job in time of peace as it might be considered not doing anything useful except perhaps giving a little of their time to fitting themselves for a duty that may never come and can come only when our nation is in danger"], [0.9445893988013268, 0.05541060119867325, 1, "the german firm of w

occupying a position in the platinum industry throughout the world almost similar to the position always occupied prior to the war of the german firm of hagenback in the wildanimal industry of the

new york city in other words the office of every one of these firms is also the office of charles engelhard just a moment ago mr baruch the chairman of the war industries board who knew i was going to make this speech called me up over the telephoneand in justice to him i want to say that lie said that charles engellard was not officially connected with the war industries board i have not said that he was i have merely said that he claimsand this is the claim he made just a few weeks agothat a part of his business was to come down here to washington every tuesday to confer with the war industries board on the subject of platinum and i know that yesterday afternoon between the hours of 3 and 4 oclock charles engelhard told a representative of the alien property custodian that he was still the adviser of the war industries board as to platinum now whether they have followed his advice or not they could not have done worse than they have and you would expect this kind of advice they have been following from this source and from the profiteering jewelers of this country charles engelhard lives at 555 park avenue new york city in the fashionable re idence section of new york it would require millions of dollars to swing the business of these four firms and yet the commercial agencies of the country are unable to obtain from charles eugelhard a satisfactory statement as to his business or as to the source of the largesums of money he must have in order to control the platinum business of the united states r1ecently a young man representing one of the great commercial agencies succeeded in passing the outer barriers and in getting into the inner office of charles engelhard hoping to find him there and to obtain from him personally ia financial statement he did not find 1im there but he lid find there apparently in control of the inner office a german alienby the name of von broek who at that time received from ulknown sources frequently sinus of money usually amounting to 6 000 which sinus he disbursed amnong germans who were out of employment on account of war conditions e rom the firm of baker co a suspected german alien was recently taken fand interned at ellis island n y where von b rodk is now interned i have called attention think to sufficient facts and these facts can not be controverted to create the strong suspicion that the platinum industry of the united states may have been controlled during the year that we have leen eagaged in this war by germany in order to be perfectlyf ir i desire to state that charles engethard claims to be naturalized but he was not naturalized according to his own statement until 1906 and at that time germany was actively preparing in so many different ways for her entry into this war i have not myself investigated the question as to whether or not he is naturalized i am assuming that his statement in this particular is true i think i have called attention to sufficient facts to show that the war industries board has been badly advised and if i succeed in turning the light of publicity upon the unfortunate situation which confronts us as a nation in the matter of platinum i may succeed in accomplishing a real conservation in time of war not of a part but of all of this most valuable basic war metal and now in conclusion i desire to call attention to just one other fact most of you are faniliar with the holmes electric protector and you are familiar with its uses it is used to protectagainst thievesvaluables money and jewels its use for the purpose of protecting books and papers
