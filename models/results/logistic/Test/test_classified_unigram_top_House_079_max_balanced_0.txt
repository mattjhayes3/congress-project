it comes to spoilage of flour i am satisfied it will run into thousands of tons the government also cornered the market on corn by making purchases of all available corn35 0l 000 bushelsat a blackmarket price of 30 cents a bushel above the legal ceiling price established by the opa the cornering of the wheat and corn supplies by the government has brought the wildest blackmarket operations in all other feed grains legitimate feed manufacturers dealers and farmers are unable to secure feed grains for dairy and beef cattle hogs and poultry we have lost about 700 000 tons of millfeed during the last 6 months because the government required mills to produce 80percent extraction flour and much more was lost when the government refused until a few days ago to sell or loan wheat to mills for grinding into flour when the administration ceased its blackmarket purchases of wheat and corn the opa increased the ceiling price on corn by 25 cents per bushel and also materially increased the ceiling price on other feeds without making any compensatory increase in the ceiling price of beef hogs poultry and dairy products of course dairy products were increased just yesterday as you know this policy throws feeding ratios out of balance and under it farmers will lose money when forced to pay the higher prices for corn and other feeds at least 7 000 000 little pigs farrowed in the spring of 1946 on american farms will never reach maturity for human consumption because economic stabilizer chester bowles and the opa failed to adjust hog prices in line with newly established grain and feed ceilings this manipulation of feed prices on the part of the administration was a deliberately conceived plan to force large liquidation of hogs cattle lnd poultry in this country because of this unsound and destructive policy we approach the coming winter with greatly reduced supplies of pork poultry eggs turkeys and dairy products turkey poultry and egg production will be cut by more than 15 percent because producers cannot buy feed at any price the production of dairy products will be reduced by more than 10 percent for 1946 as compared with 1945 i trust that you will appreciate by this time what i meant when i referred to the scarcity policy of chester bowles and his policymaking associates the economic stabilizer is determined to create a scarcity of vital food so that he can remain in power to control the lives and business of every citizen forcing the liquidation of livestock and poultry mean nothing to him but it does to consumers i wonder if the people have forgotten what took place in the early thirties when henry wallace was secretary of agriculture he conceived the policy which brought about the killing of 7 000 000 little pigs and nearly a million head of cattle we are about to witness a repetition of such a policy but instead of killing little pigs administration policies provide for slow starvation or premature marketing of the pigs which means less pork and lard at the present moment millions of chickens and turkeys are being killed on account of the manmade feed shortage all of which is to the detriment of the american people and strving millions in other parts of the world and could have been avoided by proper planning congress is attempting to provide remedies in dealing with the problems i have discussed production and more production of grain and food products and the elimination of unsound bureaucratic control are the only solution we must have the courage to do this job in order to avoid permanent domination over our economy by the pennywise dictators who feel they have been endowed to direct the lives and pursuits of every citizen if present unsound restrictions and discriminations in price policies are continued shortages in pork lard poultry eggs turkeys and dairy products will have their telling effect upon the american diet within the next 9 months wheat for flour and bread will also become critical unless a large spring wheat crop is produced and no one can predict at this date what the wheat or corn harvest will be to correct the discrimination which now threatens livestock and poultry production i desire to make the following suggestions first an immediate adjustment in the price of hog cattle and poultry products to compensate for the increase in the price of corn and other feeds this must be done to encourage production second the cancellation of the s0percent extraction order to save wheat and flour and provide at least 1 400 000 tons of millfeed in the next 12 months for domestic use this is the plan under which canada operates third permit flour mills in the united states to operate full time as they do in canada in the production of flour for domestic and foreign consumption thereby providing work for americans employed in our flour mills fourth stop government blackmarket operations in grain or any other commodity administration officials should not be permitted to corner the supplies of grain or any other commodity for which acts private individuals are sent to the penitentiary fifth encourage full production of grains food and civilian goods including farm machinery under which method price controls can and should be removed this is the only known system whereby inflation can be prevented sixth last but not least the future solvency of our country demands cutting government spending to the bone the reduction of government personnel to peacetime requirements which includes the elimination of the bureaucracy that now seeks to restrict

practical operation of it produces difficulties of a very serious nature for instance as i understood the speech of the author one of the first three provisions of the atlantic charter provides that

held in some south american country or not why that would be the most difficult sort of subject for the president to inquire into unless he set up a commission sent it down to survey the ballots and find out whether it was a free election pretty nearly every one of those countries usually has a dispute as to whether an election was honestly held or not this might put the president of the united states in the position of saying that an applicant for a loan over his own signature has failed to comply with the atlantic charter by so doing you would involve this country in new and very serious

go out in the newspapers and in the official publications and say this country is a violator because thereby you would be inviting the danger of really serious complications there is another aspect of it suppose that this bank did make a loan and after the loan was made it was rather conclusively proved that a country was operating in violation of the atlantic charter what are you going to do about it are you going to call the loan the next day if the country is in an impoverished condition and unable to pay what are you going to do about it do you want your money back if you do you will have to nurse your loan and give the institution in which it was invested an opportunity to create enough earnings to pay back the loan so you would defeat the very object of the bank under this amendment in
