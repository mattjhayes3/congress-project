it is a bill which provides that our postal service shall not be used by what is known as wildcat insurance companies a wildcat insurance company is described in this bill as being an insurance company whether life fire or marine which fails to comply with all the laws of the state or territory of its headquarters or its domicile the bill should be amended so as to force them to comply with the laws of the state or territory where the risk is located when insured to be brief and show you that such concerns are trying to do a socalled but in fact a fraudulent insurance business i give you now as i have stated heretofore an example of how they operate a b will go to new jersey and get a charter hewill then go to chicago and rent desk room and get him a directory of nashville or new orleans cincinnati and all the towns in which he desires to operate taking care to not operateinsurein illinois or new jersey he will sit down to his desk and with the most enticing invitation to the people whose names he will select from the directory write letters to them promising to give them cheap insurance the face of the letter shows this is true the facevalue rate perhaps being cheaper than it is at the home of the subsequent victim he will then write in some giltedged priomises quick settlement etc in case of fire or death so that the laboring people of the country the people who have no time to read the newspapers or to read the magazines and keep up with the sharpshooters of finance and insurance will naturally be induced into insuring with this wildcat concern the humble and the ignorant classes are thus reached and victimized as a rule a class of people whom we should be most watchful to protect and aid a b does not comply with the operating laws of new jersey he does not comply with the operating laws in illinois where he has headquartersa desk pen ink paper and city directories as their stock or money in trade he does not comply with the operating laws of tennessee or kentucky or missouri or of any other state where he insures he simply gets the charter in new jersey goes to chicago and proceeds and uses the united states mail as his sale agent to practice his wildcat scheme on the innocent and unsuspecting he dare not operate in new jersey because he does not comply with the operating laws there when the authorities in new jersey go to him and say are you going to operate here he will say no i am going to chicago ill not hurt anyone in new jersey and he goes to chicago the state officers may come to him in chicago and to them he says i am not operating in illinois i am not insuring anyone here i am insuring down in tennessee and ohio and kentucky or wherever he is operating and if i hurt anybody i shall hurt the people down in those states so he pays in no money creates no trust fund where he is charterednew jerseyand he does not comply with any operating law there he does exactly the same thing in illinois so when a man he insures in tennessee kentucky or ohio dies and his widow and children want their insurance money want the benefit of the hardearned premiums they have paid or when the little cabin burns down and they want to be reimbursed there is nobody to sue in tennessee kentucky or ohio nobody in new jersey and if you go to chicago you find a party to sueif you find him at all he proves to be good for nothing he is all wind and water no money paid in no assets no propertya bankrupt to start with in money and morals he started out to defraud if not to rob and steal certainly he gets the premiums by false pretenses by using the mails which use and abuse of the mails ought to be prohibited but the postmastergeneral does not think the law covers such a case he is however in sympathy with this kind of a bill so you see there is no agent anywhere this one person or concern is the whole thing with the united states mail as his only agent by and through which this insurance is procured the state officer does not know anything about the transaction until a death or loss occurs and then the poor fatherless or homeless victim goes to the fire commissioner of the state who is powerless to act to ventilate his trouble there is no bond filed or local agent as the laws require in all the states as a rule no one to sue no property if suit is entered the states can not reach such a case for the reason that the mail service is exclusively under the control of the federal government and not the states the insurance commissioner of the state can not interfere with the mails can not stop the conveying of the mails nor arrest a party who if he knows is delivering a letter from this robber concern to the unfortunate party who is insured or whose house has been burned down or husband has died now this bill provides distinctly that the insurer must comply with the law where his headquarters are or domicile is and it should be amended i suggest so as to require the party to comply with the law of the state or territory where the property is located or individual resides when insured this does not interfere with any state law there is now no state power that can reach the mails and for this reason the insurance commissioners or actuaries of each of the several states of this union met in columbus ohioi think in september lastand passed a resolution which i desire to have read to show that even these distinguished gentlemen who are vigorous earnest and honest declare in so many words that because these concerns use the united states mails and have no agents within the state they can not be reached and they suggest that this is a trouble and evil that congress should take in hand and cure at once i ask the clerk to read the memorial of this convention to congress this resolution is forwarded to me by mr folk insurance commissioner of tennessee who is the author of it there is a memorial to congress also read both"], [0.014799237251281738, 0.9852007627487183, 1,

are baseless and exist only in the imagination of republican politicians i live in a section of north carolina where white men predominate and where many white men are republicans we have many negroes not a majority by any means but a large number of negro voters wherever you find that the negroes predominate at the ballot or where they have a large proportion of voters there you find white men standing shoulder to shoulder men of intelligence responsibility and conscience in that great state unite inone solid effort to preserve their homes and their civilization against the evils and wrongs of negro domination if you go to the mountain counties from one of which my colleague comes where there are few negroes you will find as in the north the white men divide and line up on the great national questions and sometimes as in my colleagues district as it was in the last campaign a district goes repuablican but down in the eastern part of the state where the great cotton plantations are in some comnties the negroes outnumber the whites there you find the negroes voting solidly together and right there you find the white men almost solidly voting together regardless of the issues of imperialism trusts money protection or anything else no i can state that orth carolina has been misrepresented throughout the length and breadth of this country all we ask mir chairman is if you

sections of the country even the advocates of this bill disclaim any purpose of crippling the rural freedelivery service and give as their reason for the passage of this bill not their objection to the rural freedelivery system but first the fear of interference and control by the rural carriers of the congressional elections and second the amount of salary paid or to be paid to these rural freedelivery carriers now sir i do not believe that these objections are well founded i do not believe that the rural freedelivery carriers in any section of this country could dictate to the members of congress or to the people that they serve the congressman who discharges his duty in my opinion need not fear the influence of these rural carriers with the people along the routes they serve and i am surprised sir at the importance given in this debate to this point why sir gentlemen would have us believe that the people along the routes could be influenced and controlled by the carriers and that the congressmen would be required to do the bidding of these carriers or would receive the condemnation of the people to whom the carriers deliver the mail they can wield no such influence the people can not be controlled or used for any such purpose the congressman who favors just and legitimate legislation and discharges his duty faithfully and loyally will not be required to do the bidding of the rural freedelivery carriers by voting for increase in their salaries nor will the people be influenced by these carriers by reason of the fact that he refuses to vote for such increase i have a higher opinion of the people of the rural districts than to believe as these gentlemen do i am as much in favor of economy as any member on this floor and since i have had the honor to represent my people here i have on every occ fion insisted on reducing appropriations and in appropriating only such sums from the federal treasury as were absolutely necessary for the economic administration of the affairs of this government but i must admit my surprise in this day of extravagance at the effort of the postoffice committee to change the manner of distributing the mail on the rural freedelivery routes when in so many ingtances increase of salaries are being given to the employees in the different departments of the government now mir chairman we are told that by the contract system of letting these rural freedelivery routes to the lowest bidder we can save money and not injure the service i deny both of these propositions in the first place no man can furnish his own horse and buggy and travel 25 miles every day delivering the mails through the country who is competent to give competent and efficient service and do so for less than five or six hundred dollars a year he furnishes and feeds his own horse and also furnishes his own buggy and harness and i undertake to say that you can not hire a horse and buggy in any section of the country for less than 1 per day but say that it can be got for 25 a month this would take onehalf of the salary for horse and buggy hire alone and would allow the carrier who is paid 50 a month 25 for his services but suppose he furnishes his own horse and buggy at a cost of 150 his horse and buggy at the end of the year would be worth a great deal less if anything at all than when he began the service i doubt whether after using his horse and buggy on a route 25 miles long he could realize anything for his buggy and believe he would get little for his horse but say that his horse and buggy if he owns them himself cost him 10 per monthand it would cost him 8 or 10 a month to feed and keep his horse repair his buggy and harnessthis would give him 30 a month now i do not believe it is extravagance to pay this sum to the man who goes day in and day out without regard to weather over these routes delivering the mails to the people why sir we pay in the cities 800 for delivering the mails these carriers work eight hours a day and have no duties to perform except delivering or taking up the mails they do not have the postmasters responsibilities as have the rural carriers and while as has been stated in this debate it costs more for them to live in the cities possibly yet while they receive 200 more pay than the rural carriers they do not furnish as the rural carrier does any conveyance but only give their time in this service the proposition of the committee is to change the present manner of appointing rural freedelivery carriers to the contract system now i have heretofore discussed in detail the contract system of carrying the mails on the star routes of this country and i will not undertake to do so again at this time for my position upon that question is already well understood and i am glad that hereafter we are to have these starroute contracts let only to local bidders under the present bill it is proposed to adopt a contract system for carrying and delivering the mails on the rural freedelivery routes the present law for letting contracts for carrying the mails on star routes provides thatall contracts for carrying the mails are to be in the name of the united states and shall be awarded to the lowest bidder tendering sufficient guaranties for the faithful performance etc you will see that under the present law when contract is let for carrying the mails on a star route sufficient guaranties for faithful performance are required and i see that the requirements under this bill for carrying the mails on rural freedelivery routes are as follows who shall tender sufficient guaranties that he will personally perform capable service if this bill is passed it will give to the people the same faithful performance that they are now receiving under the contract system for carrying the mails on the star routes i do not believe sir that a more objectionable system could be devised than the present system of carrying the mail on the star routes of this country ratherthan adopt this objectionable system of carrying the mails on the rural freedelivery routes i would give my support to a proposition to abolish the present contract system of carrying the mails and authorize the postoffice department to pay a reasonable compensation for efficient service if we can not secure faithful performance of contracts for carrying the mails where the carriers only receive the mail pouch from one postmaster and deliver it to another how can we hope to have efficient service when we combine the postmaster and carrier in one and the same person for the rural freedelivery carrier is a traveling postmaster he performs all of the duties of the postmaster and there would be just as much reason in letting the postoffices to the lowest bidder as there would be in letting contracts to carry the mails and act as traveling postmaster which the rural freedelivery carrier doeswith the exception that in the case of letting the postoffices you would not couple with it the present objectionable system of carrying the mails on star routes which this bill proposes to couple with the ruralcarrier system if we adopt this bill and require these contracts to be let to the lowest bidder we will have the same class of service on the rural freedelivery rorites that we are now receiving under the starroute contract system we will have the same poor old oneeyed horse the same old rundown cart the same late mails and the same old complaints at the postoffice department that we now receive under the starroute system and the poorest possible service on every route if the present rural freedelivery service is perfected and put in operation in the rural districts of this country it means a great deal to the people living in the country it will add to the comfort and pleasure of the farmer and his family and increase the value of his property and i feel that instead of adopting the contract system proposed by this bill which would retard in my opinion rather than advance this system we should provide for a sufficient force for inspecting and laying out these rural freedelivery routes for the only complaint i have received from the people of my district in regard to rural free delivery and from those who do not now have satisfactory mail facilities is the delay of the department in acting upon petitions filed for the establishment of rural mail service i feel sir that the rural freedelivery service should not only be extended from railroad stations as is now being done by the department but that it should be adopted in counties that are not touched by railroads for the people residing away from the railroad stations along with their neighbors residing near railroads should be given their mail in the shortest possible time few of the appropriations made by congress are expended directly for the benefit of the people of the rural districts they pay their taxes are among our most upright and lawabiding citizens and it does seem to me sir that we should give to this class of our fellowcitizens the very best possible mail facilities"], [0.01760464906692505, 0.982395350933075, 1, "i can not say what i wanted to say in that time because it now lacks but ten minutes to the expira tion of general debate but i want to say one word not so much to the bill introduced by the gentleman from virginia as with reference to the question which has been suggested by my honorable friend from missouri as to what were the purposes and objects of the men who went into the confederate army i want to see the truth of history vindicated i do not wish it to go down to posterity that the object of the men who withdrew from the house and senate when the confederate government was established to raise the armies for the maintenance of the independence of the south were animated by a desire to destroy the fundamental principle which lies at the very basis of the constitution of the united states they believed that the rights and interests of the people of the south were jeopardized by mr lincoln and the party that elected him and they believed that the government was originally founded by the assent of the states they referred to the fact that when the government of the united states at the expiration of the revolutionary war was inaugurated by the original thirteen states that it was a government predicated upon the great principle of state rights and community independence it was for this that they made the declaration it was for that that they fought the four years war of the confederacy am i right or wrong when i say that history defends our action the original thirteen states framed the government which was to become the government over the states which ratified it if 9 states ratified it and then by the very declaration of the constitution itself it was to become a government only over the states so ratifying the same five states of the original thirteen including north carolina and 3 others for a long time refused to accede to the government of the united states they finally did so and it became the government over 13 states and the language of the constitution was that it was to be a government only over the states so ratifying the same the people of the south believed that their rights were jeopardized they appealed to the great principles which laid at the foundation of the constitution of 1789 which was the principle of home rule and a community independence when we had this war it was not for the destruction of that great cardinal principle but for its preservation and when the war closed and the government had to be again reorganized and these southern states again to be brought into the union how was it done mr chairman not by force of the government not by the bayonet and sword but it was done by the consent of the people in convention assembled they therefore did not make war upon the principles which lay at the foundation of the federal constitution but they made the war to maintain those principles to defend and not destroy them i want the truth of history to be written not in the spirit of laudation of one side and abuse of the other but i want it to be written in the light of history which will show how the government was originally framed and what was the purpose and object of the men who served in the confederate army it was an army organized to preserve the great and vital principles of the constitution it was a government founded on those principles and when the confederate constitution came to be adopted in montgomery and the government finally established at richmond they adopted the very same principles only they specified with more particularity some of the grounds on which that constitution was adopted and when the war closed and this rehabilitation had to occur it was decided by the court of highest resortby that tribunal to whose decision we bowthat this was originally a government founded upon the consent of the states that it was a government of free and independent states based upon the action of the states and that it was not a government of force and power and hence it was that every state in the union that was in the federal government furnished its soldiers under that principle of the constitution mentioned in the decision of the supreme court that this was an indissoluble union based on free and independent and indestructible states if the states had to yield to the superior force it did not render less sacred the great principles for which they were struggling it was as old as the history of the englishspeaking people and extended back to the time when our ancestors made the declaration of rights and passed the bill of rights and in our own country to the time when our ancestors assembled in philadelphia and declared that it was a government for the protection of the interests of the people of the states that the colonies were and of right ought to be free and independent states it was to maintain that great principle that the government of the confederacy was formed and her soldiers fought for it not for the destruction of the great principles of the constitution because they had to be reverted to when we came to reorganize our government after the war at first it was attempted to do this by sending military satraps to the southern states to be governors over us with an armed force that was a failure the reconstruction laws were a failure it was found that there was no way of reorganizing this government and bringing back the confederate states under the government except by the consent of those states as expressed in their conventions and thus we stand todayreunited because we were struggling for the great principles of home rule and community independence and not to destroy the cardinal and essential principles which lie at the very basis of the original constitution of 1789 which is now the constitution of the united states of america our forefathers in their solemn declaration of independence which severed the ties that bound them to the mother country declared that these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states they waged the seven years war of the revolution to maintain this declaration they succeeded when they came to form a civil government to protect the liberties thus dearly achieved they refused to give the federal government created under the articles of confederation the power of taxation the war of the revolution had been waged by them to free the colonies from unjust onerous and oppressive taxation without representation it was doubtless this recollection fresh in their minds which prompted them to deny the power of taxation to the newly constructed confederacy a very few years sufficed to show that a general or federal government dependent on the voluntary quota of taxes to be furnished by each state and without the power of taxation could not be selfsustaining a commission was appointed at the head of which stood alexander hamilton to meet at annapolis md to amend the articles of confederation finding amendment impracticable they recommended to the continental congress to call a convention of all the original 13 states the continental congress passed an act authorizing a convention of all the original 13 states to assemble at philadelphia in 1787 to adopt a new constitution the convention presided over by general washington adopted the new constitution known as the constitution of 1789 and in accordance with its own provisions submitted it to the several states for their adoption or rejection let it at once be noted that by the very terms of this constitution it was to become a constitution over the states only when 9 of the original 13 states should in convention assembled adopt the same thus placing it in the power of 5 of the smallest of the original 13 states with an insignificant and sparse population to have defeated its adoption it is also important to observe that this constitution of 1789 further provided that when adopted by 9 of the original 13 states it should only be operative and binding on the states so ratifying the same each state ratified the constitution for itself by itself and was bound only by its own ratification so when the rights and liberties of the southern states were invaded by unlawful conspiracies and combinations to destroy their property and disturb their domestic tranquillity what was more natural than that they should declare as they acceded to the union of their own right and free will to secure liberty and the peaceable possession of their property when this was denied them they had the right of secession when the war closed we surrendered by capitulation with arms in our hands what were the terms of the capitulation with grant at appomattox and sherman in north carolina they were that the confederates should furl their flags stack their arms return to their homes and yield obedience to the constitution and the laws of the union then and g here existing and it was stipulated on the other side that they should have the protection of the constitution and laws of the union and should not be molested because of their participation in the confederate war that the confederates kept the terms of their capitulation no one will be heard to deny when an effort was made to include gen robert e lee in the indictment with mr davis the great union general u s grant with a magnanimity which characterized the terms given by him at appomattox said no this can not be this would be to dishonor the parole granted by me to lee and his men when they surrendered with arms in their hands and on written terms of capitulation and thus jefferson davis was left alone to bear our sins and right royally did he bear the burden and wear the manacles of a prisoner the question soon arose as to how the seceded states were to be brought back into the union it was at first attempted to effect this by force and on this plan military commanders were assigned to duty as governors of the seceded states this proved a failure it was then attempted to rehabilitate the seceded states by unjust and oppressive reconstruction laws this too proved a failure the united states government had at last to recognize the great principle of home rule and community independence which is the corner stone of the constitution of 1789 and allow the states in their own conventions to resume their places in the union let it be remembered that under our constitution the constitution of 1789 delaware the smallest state in the union with her 67 000 people and her one representative in this house as one of the original thirteen states and with one representative still stands on a perfect equality in the senate with new york with her 6 000 000 and upon a proposition to destroy the equality of the states in the senate can put her veto on all the other states and all the people of all the other states and that she can not be deprived of this power but by her own consent the sovereign power and entity of the states had not been destroyed by the secession of the states nor had it been destroyed by the four years war between the states the supreme court of the united states that august tribunal to whose ultimate decision all good citizens bow declared in the celebrated case of ex parte garland that this was an indissoluble union composed of indestructible states and so the termination of the war between the states found all the southern states with indestructible sovereignties still theirs and yielding a willing obedience to the laws of the union the southern states believed they had the right to retire from the union they never sought or desired to destroy that union when the seceding states had adopted a constitutiona complete counterpart of the constitution of 1789their first act was as early as february 4 before the inauguration of mr lincoln to appoint a commission for the purpose of negotiating friendly relations between that government and the confederate states of america and for the settlement of all questions of disagreement between the two governments upon the principles of right justice equity and good faith two of these commissioners were martin crawford of georgia and john forsythe of alabama the then secretary of state mr seward refused to hear the proposition of the commissioners of the confederate states and the war was begun it has been asserted by some that this war was waged by the confederate forces to perpetuate slavery and by the union forces to free the slaves i deny the truth of this statement the abolition of slavery was an incident of the war and a very striking one but not the cause of it the differences which were developed in the very convention which framed the constitution of 1789 and in the convention of each one of the original thirteen states that met to ratify or reject this constitution were as to whether the government created by this constitution was a national and central government or how far it was federative in its character this was the germ from which the conflict came i listened with great pleasure to the very broad philanthropic and patriotic speech of the honorable gentleman from virginia on his bill to admit the confederate soldiers to the soldiers homes built by the governnent to give homes and shelter and maintenance to the union soldiers and thought to myself that he drew his thought and inspiration from the sentiments uttered at atlanta ga by our late noble president william mckinley whose untimely death shrouded the whole people in mourning when he proposed that the graves of the dead confederate soldiers should receive the same care and attention as those of the union soldiers had this proposition come with absolute unanimity from our brothers on the other side of this chamber i might have been willing to have agreed with the proposition so forcibly presented by the gentleman from virginia but the confederate soldier still surviving though poor has lost none of his pride and selfesteem he risked all and lost all in the great conflict between the states save his honor this is dearer to him than the laurel wreath that crowns the victors brow he can not accept anything in the shape of charity except it be the offering of those who shared his perils and triumphs and defeat in the great conflict"], [0.02061450481414795, 0.979385495185852, 1, "certainly that is very just there was no objection to that my objection went to bills on the calendar sought

in the office of the cominissioner of the land office and the interior departmentthe abuses of the service if any as now carried on and the service as it now is in the agricultural departmentits nature and the abuses of the service if any there are and the necessity for the proposed change if any now i will very briefly state the conditions in 1789 just after the adoption of the constitution the office of the commissioner of the general land office was created it continued from that time down until 1849 when it was placed under the secretary of the interior where it still remains it is a great service it has covered the public lands and kindred services from the time it was organized to the present it is thoroughly organized here let me state that there are now in the land office at washington as employees 388 persons at a cost of 502 430 per annum in addition to that touching depredations upon the timber landsthe public lands throughout the republicthere are 69 special agents69 persons who are watching depredations upon the lands of the united statestimber lands alone incidentally this service covers trespasses on the public lands also destruction of timber also forest fires but substantially the service relates to trespasses and the despoiling of the timber this service cost 185 000 per annum in addition to that on the forest reserves46 000 000 acres in round numbersthere are 349 persons employed by the governmentrangers agents superintendents who are engaged touching those forest reservesforest fires the sale of dead and down timber the use of timber and stone by the settlers and by the miner and so on one very important object of the work of these 349 persons in the forestreserve service is the forest fires and incidentally the whole service in connectio n with that subject those 349 persons cost 300 000 per annum now it will be seen that almost 1 000 000 is the cost of the general land office alone and these persons that i speak ofan annual charge now in addition to that there are in this great office of the secretary of the interior what is called the secretarys officethat is the staff of the office if you please embracing many bureaus in the office of the department the secretarys office proper has 241 people in it costing per annun 314 410 it is a complete staff of assistant secretaries chief clerks appointment clerks a complete disbursing office for the whole interior servicepatents indians pensions surveys and so on so that in theory and in practice during almost a hundred years this service has grown up and is adjusted in a certain way now the land office proper is divided into 11 divisions it is unnecessary i should name these specifically but in a general way i may say that among these 11 divisions there is a law division there is a claims division there is a patent division there is an entry and preemption division there is a mineral division there is a swampland division there is a division that pertains to indian reservations there is a railroad division and there is a forestry division under which is made this expenditure of 030 000 for the force in the field alone if there is a trespass on the public lands whether it be in the forest reservations or outside there is the legal machinery there are the agents there is the whole shooting match it is like topsy it growed and it has been growing for a century now in these forest reservations there are 46 000 000 acres there are applications pending to add to these forest reservations 54 000 000 acres but there are 46 000 000 acres now outside of alaska not appropriated or reservedi mean free landsin acreage outside of alaska outside of the indian reservations outside of the forest reservations there are 546 000 000 acres so that i am safe in saying that while there are 46 000 000 hcres in the various reservations there are three times 46 000 000 acres of the same kind of land not in the various reservationsin the mountains and in the valleys so that you have 46 000 000 of acres in forest reservations 546 000 000 of acres outside of alaska of general public lands and two times as much in timber outside of the forest reservations as in the forest reservations here is an imaginary line between the two now i say this much to call your attention to the status now wlmt does this bill propose to do i have it here it proposes to authorize the president of the united states to transfer the administration of the forest reservations the care and sale of timber the use of timber by the settler and the miner the care and preservation of the forests the sale of timber all of these things to the jurisdiction of the agricultural department leaving in the interior departmentthe other 514 000 000 of acres over 100 000 000 of timber the same kind of timber and stone that there is in these forest reservations under the jurisdiction of the interior department and they propose in addition to leave the qubstion of lieu lands in the reservations with the commissioner of the general land office you understand what lieu lands are in these forest reservations there are many many thousands of private owners of lands under the law they can exchange those lands by conveying them to the government for an equal acreage outside of the forest reservation that is to be left with the interior department then in all the forest reservations mineral titles may be obtained and are constantly being exploited and developed that is left under the jurisdiction of the interior department now then here is the divided jurisdiction that this bill proposes to make and in making it it proposes to make at the very beginning a complete staff of officers in the agricultural department or what would result in it to receive the moneys from the sale of timber under the law as now in force if there is a sale of timber or stone the receivers of the general land office scattered all over the country receive that money without cost to the government or without additional cost this bill authorizes the secretary of agriculture to make an officer of that kind and that means a complete staff of receivers upon every forest reservation and frequently at various points upon the forest reservations that is to follow by regulation and a little later on by appropriation now it has been alleged from time to time and no doubt truly alleged that the administration of the public lands and of the timbered and forestry land and of our park systems throughout the great west have not been perfect in the nature of things they could not be perfect o n the average they are 2 000 miles away from washington how could they be perfect yet i am here to say that in my judgment in the main this jurisdiction and duty has been exercised fai rly well i think it might be improved i believe it is being improved some people believe that we do not give enough money for this service perhaps we do not and yet it is a service that costs a good deal you will see now what is the propositon i have stated it already to take these forest reservespart of the jurisdictionaway from the general land office away from the interior department and drop it into the agricultural department what is the argument for it oh they say we have got a forestry division already organized there in the agricultural department well that is true let me show you how much of a one you have and what it does a division of forestry rests in appropriation alonethere has never been any organic acta division of forestry was appropriated for in the agricultural department in 1887 and an appropriation of 8 000 was made what for for science in forestry that is the only function it has ever hadnot administration not sale of timber not sale of stone not sale of dead and down timber not the policing of the use of timber by miners and settlers but pure and simple forestry how best to reforest how best to preserve forests that is the service well from 1887 to this time see the growth for the coming year the bureau of forestry in the agricultural department is to cost 291 860 almost as much as the whole personnel of the commissioner of the general land office in washington"], [0.022655854001641273, 0.022655854001641273, 0, "yes the statement accompanies it the conference report and statement are as follows the committee of conference on

conferencesnotably the recent gathering at the haguehave since the period to which he referred entirely modified the rules and usages of war he says that under the rules of the hague conference the red cross society was adopted as the medium through which relief may be extended in cases such as exist in south africa that is true but is there anything in the proceedings at that conference declaring that no other humane agency devised for the pmpose of relieving distress and especially for the purpose of relieving women and children and noncombatants shall be recognized he said that mr davis the president of the southern confederacy would not have permitted unauthorized persons to enter the confederate lines for the purpose of distributing relief that had such a person applied for such permission it would have been unconditionally refused i thank the gentleman from texas for handing me a letter from a union soldier received by the gentleman from texas since the discussion of the other day a part of this letter which i will now read answers this part of the argument of the gentleman from illinois listen to it i read in the newspapers that mr hitt said jefferson davis would not have allowed northern sympathizers to perambulate through southern camps to distribute relief my brother herbert withngton was taken prisoner with his colonel 0 p wilcox of the first michigan in the civil war the prisoners were in need of everything their friends in michigan gathered supplies and the confederate authorities permitted mrs marie wilcox the imprisoned colonels wife to distribute the relief this is a sufficient reply to the statement made by the gentleman from illinois the gentlemans contention from beginning to end was predicated upon a false assumption he said repeatedly that no govermnent would allow people to pass to and fro through fortified lines during war as a means of extending relief to suffering people of course not who has proposed to request permission to enter fortified places who is seeking to tramp to and fro through the fortified camps in south africa are the british compelled to maintain fortified camps in south africa is it conceivable that valuable information as to military operations or as to british fortifications might be communicated to the boers by the men and women who seek an opportunity to go to the rescue of the sick and dying women and babies who are in the horrible prison pens of south africa the camps in which these prisoners are confined are in a country occupied by 250 000 british soldiers opposed to this great army are forces which today according to the best accounts number less than 20 000 does the gentleman from illinoisdoes our secretary of statebelieve that the real cause of objection to allowing charitable inhabitants of neutral countries to relieve these sufferers is the fear that those who go to south africa with food clothing and medicine for women and babies who are starving clad in rags and dying for want of medical aid will somehow help the military operations of the boer army nations like individuals must take cognizance of facts concerning which there is no room for doubt why should the american republic not take cognizance of conditions prevailing in south africa why we upbraided and finally went to war with spain for her cruelty to the cubans may we not be permitted to relieve the victims of kitcheners far more brutal policy in south africa upon what pretext could the british government withhold its consent what a travesty it isthis pretense that in order to maintain strict neutrality we must abstain from asking permission to bestow charity upon suffering women and children sir i charge that the state department has not maintained the strict neutrality of this country it has winked at the deliberate violation of a rule of international law laid down by the hague conference and has made no protest against englands violation of every rule of civilized warfare laid down at the hague one of those rules prescribed that private property should not be taken or wantonly destroyed by an invading army and yet uponthe pretense of military necessity the british army has applied the torch to threefourths of the habitations of the farmers of south africa reducing a prosperous and wealthy community to a condition of desolation and despair another rule of the hague conference forbids war upon noncombatants it is incontrovertible that having burned the houses over the heads of the women and children the british soldiery have piled farming utensils and vehicles upon bonfires and burned them and that when women thus made homeless and beggared have begged they might be conveyed in their own comfortable conveyances to the barbedwire prison pens where they are starving by thousands they have seen these vehicles wantonly destroyed and have then been conveyed long distances in army transport wagons to the horrible prison camps in which they are confined thus women and children numbering 25 000 have been imprisoned in the transvaal republic alone and what about the rations issued for their sustenance the british medical officer in charge of that camp at johannesburg stated in an official report that the rations were not sufficient to preserve the prisoners in good health and the british officer having charge of the police regulation of the camp reported that the ration furnished was not sufficient to keep body and soul together but that is not all in issuing rations a distinction was made between women and children whose husbands and fathers were still in the ranks fighting for their country and those whose hus bands had been killed or had surrendered or hadnever been engaged in the war bear in mind that the full ration was insufficient to keep body and soul together according to the statement of a british officer and yet it was ordered that women and children whose husbands and fathers were still fighting for their country should receive only half of it here is the explanation of englands aversion to the relief of the sufferers the world would thereby be afforded a glimpse of the hell which british cruelty has created in south africa miss hobhouse a philanthropic british woman went there with money raised by the good people of england to relieve the distress and made a report that so shocked and shamed the british nation that she was prohibited from returning with additional relief oh what a pity it iswhat a reproach to all humanitythat no hand is outstretched to save this heroic people from destruction no wonder that chamberlain and kitehener have closed the door to prevent humanity from even a glimpse of the charnel house which is relied upon to destroy a race and overthrow republican institutions in south africa think of it the prevailing mortality among the children is so great that if it continues in two years the 25 000 children confined in prison pens in south africa will be dead think of it twentyfive thousand children made prisoners of war and deliberately starved to death by order of the commander of the army of a power professedly christian and presumably civilized and we are told that the rules of international law prohibit our government from respectfully asking safe conduct for philanthropic men and women who would go to the relief of these unfortunates such talk might havp sounded well in the dark ages but thank heaven there has been at least an attempt to so modify the laws and usages of war that at least theoretically they are somewhat in consonance with the laws of good conscience and humanity thank heaven it is no infraction of international law to offer clothing to the naked food to the starving and medicine to the sick whose misfortune it is to dwell in a country ravaged by war and thank heaven that the laws of civilized war prohibit even if the nations do not prevent wars of extermination women and children those too old or too young to be dangerous to belligerents may not be lawfully killed or even impounded as prisoners of war in explanation of his proenglish proclivities will the secretary of state dare to plant himself upon the defense attempted by the gentlewan from illinois and say that some rule of international law prohibits him from asking of the british monarchy permission to send relief to this suffering people if so what becomes of the rules laid down at the hague conference he may say that the boers are unreasonable in such prolonged and desperate resistance of great britain what of it a rule laid down at the hague conference declares that when a country is suddenly invaded and the people take up arms spontaneously in its defense they are entitled to be treated as belligerents and that the war against them must conform to the code laid down at the conference and it was also declared that in defending their country they shall have a right to determine for themselves how far resistance shall go the boerssubject to the rules of civilized warfare themselves of coursemay prolong their resistance indefinitely and the rules of the hague conference accords to them all the rights of a belligerent power i say that any person who will read the deliberations of the hague conference will find that many of the most wise and beneficent regulations there established for the control of the operations of armies were placed in the body of international law at the instance and on the initiative of the british representatives and sanctioned by our representative and that the british government and our own have been guilty of the

service commission under the direction of the president of the united states i was among those who did not believe that this step was wise or desirable but since its operation became effective i have had occasion to look into the whole plan and i do not hesitate to fully indorse it inmy opinion it provides the most simple and practicable the most sensible application of the principle of civil service yet attempted by this government when the announcement was first made that the order classifying the rural freedelivery service included carriers as well as clerks and special agents most of us thought that the complicated not to say cumbersome system of civilservice examinations prescribed for older branches of the postal service was to be attempted in the appointment of rural carriers the introduction of the civilservice rules in vogue in the postoffice department and in the postoffices of our large cities would in my judgment prove as disastrous to the future of the rural free delivery as the proposed contract system carried in this bill there is no doubt that this view was entertained by the postoffice officials the plan finally adopted by the postoffice dopaxtment and the civil service commission for the classification of rural carriers shows that those who were charged with its preparation fully grasped the situation understood the conditions to be met in rural districts and realized that the success of the scheme depended largely upon the simplicity of its form of examinations and the ease of its execution no one who has looked into the system examined the blanks provided for the examination of applicants for the position of rural carrier and observed the results already produced since its inauguration can have the slightest objection to its enforcement the examination is simple enough to be within reach of any person of ordinary intelligence in fact anyone who can not pass it is not fit to be a rural carrier the time required to take a regular civilservice examination in the city and departmental service is from seven to eight hours the examination prescribed for rural carriers requires from thirty to forty minutes the examination consists briefly in the filling out of a blank form of application on which are printed a number of simple questions the answers to these questions written in the applicants writing serve a double purpose first they show the ability of the applicant to read and write secondly they convey to the special agent who conducts the examination valuable and necessary information bearing upon the applicants fitness and qualifications they show briefly whether or not he is a citizen of the united states his age place of birth length of residence in the state whether or not he resides directly on or within the territory of the proposed route whether or not he has or is prepared to furnish a suitable horse and cart or wagon for use in the service whether or not he could furnish a suitable substitute to act during his absence in cases of emergency they also disclose whether or not he has hal any experience in postoffice work or in any other position similar to that of rural carrier and whether or not he is an honorably discharged soldier or sailor of the civil or the spanish war the applicant is also required to fill out a blank registry receipt and a receipt for money for the purchase of a money orderblanks which he would use in the service he is also required to read 25 addressed envelopes or cards after an applicant has filled out the application blanks and sworn to his statements the special agent who investigated the establishment of the route acting in the capacity of civilservice examiner briefly states on the blank provided for that purpose on the back of the application blank whether or not the applicant appears to be in good health and capable of performing service he also makes a brief statement as to the applicants reputation in the community states how many minutes he required to fill out the examination blank the time consumed and errors made in reading the test cards the agent closes his findings as follows judging from this applicants appearance his general intelligence the manner and promptness with which ie filled out the application blank and considering his answers to the questions therein i am of the opinion that he should stand on the list of eligiblesfirst second or third etc as the case might be so you see the examination is simmered down to a practical test of the applicants ability to read and write and to properly fill out the blanks used in the service the selection after all is left largely to the judgment of the special agent who of course is guided by certain rules for instance in a case where the applicants are equal in other respects the one having the necessary equipment would be given preference over the one who has no equipment the applicant who has resided longest on the route would be preferred to one who was new in the community a soldier capable of performing service would be given preference over a civilian a young and active man would be selected in preference to an old man who is not a soldier to show that it is not the purpose of the civil service commission or the postoffice department to give a preponderance of weight to the scholastic tests i will quote from the instructions issued to special agents too much importance should not be attached to tile cardreading test the filling out of the blank application sufficiently tests the applicants ability to rcad and write however the manner and speed in which an pplicant reads the cards will aid the examiner somewhat in judging of the applicants general intelligence another before the applicant fills out the blank form of registry receipt and the receipt for money for the purchase of a money order the special agent or route inspector should take pains to give general instructions pertaining to the blanks and their uses the unique feature of this plan however lies in the fact that the people petitioning for the establishment of service practically control the selection of the carrier the new rules requiring that every petition for service shall have added to it names of applicants suggested by the signers what better system could be de ised i am sure no more satisfactory plan from the peoples standpoint could be conceived the most efficient service will no doubt be found where the carrier belongs to the people they will take pride in him as well as in the service they will feel that through him a salaried employee of the postal service they will be in close and constant touch with the government in other words the rural service is a service by the people as well as for the people the plan of civil service that i have just described is the first of the kind to be adopted by this government it is in fact an experiment on the lines of sensible civilservice reform it only becanme effective on february 1 of this year and although those who are in charge of its operation are greatly pleased with the results thus far obtained there has not yet been sufficient time to fully test and develop so new a departure why then

normal school in richigan he may be a good teacher but he is totallyunfit for the position of superintendent of any indian school the place has the appearance of decay its fences are down and everything seems to be going to wreck mr nardin does not have the ability to secure the attendance of pupils and after they are placed in the school by the agent and the police he does not seem to be able to hold them there many escapes being made by pupils while i was there i think in all 40 girls and boys ran away it does not seem as though it should be necessary for a representative of the department to be obliged to go there and tell him that the children are not properly clothed in a communication i sent you a few days ago inclosing a copy of an order to the agent to transfer the matron i explained to you the way they were clothed legthy comments are not neijessary if this school is to be brought to any reasonable degree of success the management must be changed i think liliely nardin could successfully fill a position of principal teacher but he has not the executive and business ability to fill the office of superintendent in the face of a report of that character this man was advanced in the service if there are on file in the indian office any reports which exonerate this superintendent they certainly could have been found as readily as these reports i would like to adopt the suggestion of my colleague but i believe that in the face of these reports this house should take the responsibility now of saying whether this man shall remain in the service or whether he shall not if there is any official document to exonerate him from responsibility for the acts charged here it should be produced here and in the absence of it we are justified in assuming that it does not exist while i regret that i can not adopt the suggestion of my colleague at this time because such an investigation could not be had until this bill would be enacted into law i

onethird of her territory taken from her and now with the largest state debt in the union she to her credit be it said contributes as i understand it a larger per cent of her state revenues for

down until it has received the unanimous voice of the committee nor indeed after all that pruning will i say to the gentleman from iowa that there is no word in it which can not be criticised nevertheless it may be fairly said to the gentleman from iowa in discussing at this stage of the debate not the particular words of any section but the general purpose of the bill that its purpose can not be objected to it provides means to inform the government as to what may be done or appoints officers for information for staff duty for coordination of the various departments it does not interfere with the management of the armies in the field the gentleman from iowa rightly pointed out that this is not the duty of a chief of staff it is true that a chief of staff during our greatest war did interfere with the movements of our greatest commander until he was called down by the president and told that his duties werethose of information to the commander in chief and not the issuing of orders on his own account this bill is carefully guarded in that respect by its terms the duties of the general staff are first to prepare plans for the national defense and for the mobilization of the military forces in time of war thus by the bill the general staff is not to execute plans but to prepare plans and the secretary of war says that they should be alternative plans that many plans should be submitted to the president or to the general in command of a particular expedition the secretary of war in the hearings said distinctly that if those plans should be approved by the general in command of the expedition the general would follow them if they should not be approved he would not follow them the duties of this general staff by this bill are further to investigate and report upon all questions affecting the efficiency of the army and its state of preparation for military operations they are to investigate and reportto give information as to where troops can be obtained whence we can safely call them how we can safely and well transport them how we can supply them howwe can get the transportation department and the medical department and the subsistence department to work together where we shall get our officers and where we shall get our men the staff is to investigate and report and again to render professional aid and assistance to the secretary of war and to general officers and other superior commanders they are thus at the service of tjie secretary of war to assist him in the duties of his department"]]}
