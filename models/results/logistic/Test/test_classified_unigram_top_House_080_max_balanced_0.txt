just what is involved in this question what is the tva it is an accomplished fact this agency was created and now exists by an act of congress passed may 18 1933 which has since been amended it is a corporation set up by the congress for the purpose of maintaining and operating the properties then owned by the united states in the vicinity of muscle shoals alabama it was created in the interest of national defense and to develop the agricultural and industrial resources of the region to improve navigation on the tennessee river and to control the destructive flood waters on the tennessee river its tributaries and the mississippi the construction of the tva dams could not have been undertaken by private companies they were constructed for a threefold purpose to make navigable the tennessee river to control the destructive floodwaters of the tennessee river its tributaries and the mississippi and to develop hydroelectric power the federal government from time to time has spent billions of dollars along the eastern and western seacoasts of this country on the gulf of mexico on the great lakes and on the rivers of our country to improve navigation and to prevent floods the first extensive expenditure of money by the federal government for these purposes on the tennessee river and its tributaries began with the establishment of the tsnnessee valley authority the dams constructed by this agency since its organization on the tennessee river are kentucky chickamauga pickwick landing wheeler guntersville watts bar fort loudoun the dams constructed by the authority on the tributaries of the tennessee river are norris hiwassee cherokee douglas fontana appalachia nottly ocoee no 3 and chatuge the authority now has under construction the watauga and the south holston dams in upper east tennessee it purchased from power companies the following dams hales bar ocoee dams nos 1 and 2 blue ridge and great falls as a result of the construction of the dams now completed the tennessee river is navigable the year round from knoxville in my district to the gulf of mexico to the upper reaches of the mississippi and its tributaries and to the great lakes with the completion of the watauga and south holston dams the floodwaters of the tennessee will be wholly under control the government has invested in this project approximately 800 000 000 a portion of this investment is allocated to flood control and navigation the balance to power production and distribution the great supply of electric power made available by the authority led to the establishment of the oak ridge atomicenergy plant by the government for the production of the atomic bomb in anderson and roane counties in the second congressional district the atomic plant was located in this section of tennessee for the following reasons first oak ridge is far from the sea coast surrounded by mountains by the clinch river and by hills second because of the vast amount of electric current which tva was able to furnish i third because of the unquestioned loyalty of our people who worked on this project more than 1 000 scientists were engaged in the production of the bomb and more than 100 000 people worked on the project in addition to this because of tva electric current the aluminum co of america which itself has built and operates five great hydroelectric dams near its alcoa plant in blount county within 16 miles of knoxville tenn increased its output of aluminum for war purposes 700 percent and it may be said without the fear of successful contradiction that thousands of american boys are alive today who would have been killed in this world war but for the fact that the aluminum co of america at its plant in alcoa was able to turn oit all of the aluminum needed for the production of war planes and that at oak ridge was made and prepared for use the atomic bomb the tennessee valley authority all of its dams steam plants hydroelectric installations and its transmission lines are the property of all the people of the united states it is not a sectional institution it is a national institution and the unhallowed hands of mr smith and his power satellites should not be permitted to arrest or stifle its further development nor to say to the more than 5 000 000 people who are wholly dependent on this great agency for electric current thus far shall you progress and develop and contribute to the national welfare and the national defense but no farther shall you go it must be remembered that the fight being waged ostensibly against tva is in reality and in effect a fight against the people who are served by the tva and who are wholly dependent upon it for electric current not only is the tva under attack but the people who live in this area are under attack what has the tennessee valley authority accomplished what is the need for it what is the need for its expansion who does it serve the most essential tool of modern progress is electric energy a more profitable agriculture and a more productive soil go hand in hand with the ability of the farmer to grow more crops on fewer acres to do this he must not be a onecrop farmer he must make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before he must grow two to five bushels of corn where he formerly only grew one land the fertility of which has been exhausted by successive crops of corn cotton and tobacco must be sowed to clover to grass to small grains to achieve these ends the farmer must have electricity to operate milking machines to furnish water both hot and cold to his dairy barn and milk house to furnish him cold storage and to lighten the toil of his wife in the home in 1933 when tva had its beginning only one farm in 28 in the region had electric service today onehalf the farms have electric service in 1933 all the farms in the area consumed a total of only 10 000 000 kilowatthours a year in 1947 these same farmers used 300 000 000 kilowatthours to increase profitable diversified farming and to insure the regions prosperity the farms alone will require an ever increasing supply of electric current"], [0.9009502530097961, 0.9009502530097961, 0, "none at all i followed the custom that had been in existence from the time i started in the circuit clerks office in 1932 and his speeches didnt have any effect at all on me bearing on the custom and tradition as existing in the state of mississippi the record indicates that but an extremely small portion of the white and colored of the state population are not nativeborn about threetenths of 1 percent and from that it follows that the custom and tradition with regard to white democratic primaries is inbred and ingrained into the great majority of mississippi citizenry a majority of the committee are of the opinion that the record clearly shows that irrespective of what senator bilbo actually said in his campaign oratory the disqualification of and prevention of the negro from registering or voting would have been the same since that is uniformly the attitude of the native white mississippi citizenry two statements which senator blo was alleged to have made in the course of his campaign were exhibit 1 1 i call on every redblooded white man to use any means to keep the niggers away from the polls if you dont understand what that means you are just plain dumb 2 im calling on every redblooded american who believes in the superiority and integrity of the white race to get out and see that no nigger votes and the best time to do it is the night before witness after witness was questioned about these statements and as to their intended effect and actual effect upon the electorate and upon election officials senator bilbo was asked to explain these alleged statements he admitted to fiequent repetition of the phrase about seeing them the night before the election but denied that he intended that those following his admonitions give other than friendly advice to negroes the night before the election it is significant that not one witness testified that he had been seen the night before the election nor was there any evidence of any violence connected with seeing negroes the night before the election on the record we can only conclude that senator bilos intention as well as the effect of his words was the giving of friendly advice to negroes as to the allegation that senator bilbo urged use of any means to prevent negroes from voting senator bilbo categorically denied ever making such a statement at the hearing he insisted he always used the adjective lawful means in the transcript of the radio speech which he made the night before the election he used the adjective lawful several witnesses who heard senator brleos speeches also recollected that he used the adjective lawful on the record of conflicting accounts the majority conclude that he used the word lawful and that if on some occasions he neglected to use the adjective as alleged by some witnesses it was due to a slip of the tongue this conclusion is further supported by a report of an interview between senator bilso and some reporters of the press as included in the record page 787 which interview occurred on august 9 1946 and in which senator bilbo spoke of this point as follows spivak do you believe when you speak as you did in your primary you are upholding the fifteenth amendment bino i certainly was there was nothing in violation of that provision of the constitution in anything that i said and i said further that it was the duty of every white democrat in mississippi to resort to every means within the law to keep the negro from voting in our primary because they were not qualified to vote while the record shows that in some respects senator bilbos campaign oratory was crude and in poor taste as viewed by some it is our opinion that these statements cannot and should not be reasonably construed as indicative of moral turpitude or as unconstitutional and illegal mississippi politics have always been heated and the type of campaign oratory used by senator bilbo conforms to the custom prevalent in mississippi for many years and to the wishes of the white citizenry of mississippi regarding their candidates position as evdenced bythe returns in the primary in which senator bilbo led his nearest opponent by nearly 40 000 votes we consider it a highly dangerous precedent for the senate of the united states to criticize one of its members for conforming to the pattern desired by the electorate in his particular state in order to obtain the nomination merely for the reason that that pattern may not happen to be that espoused in many of the other states the testimony of two of the socalled leaders of the negroes in mississippi t b wilson president of the mississippi progressive voters league and percy green editor of the states leading negro newspaper the jackson advocate showed that they did all that they could to get the negroes to come to the polls and yet that in hinds county in spite of their efforts only 414 out of 55 000 registered and only 195 out of the 414 voted the record shows further that there was no trouble in hinds county in negroes registering or voting and that in spite of that fact and the efforts of these leaders a very small number of negroes even went so far as to register to vote percy green testified to an editorial carried on the front page of his paper and in the new orleans times picayune and the memphis commercial appeal which invited and requested the negroes to put down all show of force and arms and go to the polls and vote and yet in spite of that fact and the fact that no one in hinds county was seen the night before or otherwise troubled very few negroes showed

too far it repeals much of the progress that organized labor has made it brings us back to the gunandclubstrikebreakerage it is this kind of legislation that makes a wallace and his pink and commy

over the air by the evidence of a few disgruntled labor skates and a few international racketeers and industrialists who again made millions upon millions out of a warmad world i feel that the committee should have brought in a simple bill outlawing jurisdictional and wildcat strikes and preventing violence cases such as these took place in recent years in new york and wisconsin where the state officials failed to do their duty and preserve law and order then it should have provided for and set forth the conditions under which municipal and public service plants and industries that directly affect the welfare of the people would be continued in operation during a strike such a bill would have met with little or no opposition on the part of labor this bill no more than the smithconnally act will end strikes but it will create bitterness and hatred we should remember that many of the veterans belong to organized labor of all times this is the time to strive for unity and not disunity if there ever was a time for calm and sober thinking it is now i know that both my democratic and republican friends have denounced wallace for his unseeming conduct abroad i know that both my democratic and republican friends would like to have him stay where he is however if we pass this antilabor legislation then he will be back to plague both parties we will have played into his hands then we will have played the game that he and his followersthe pinks the reds and theoffcolorswish us to play we will have slapped organized labor in the face let us remember that organized labor with its friends constitute 48 percent of our population that under our form of government they have 48 percent say about the government under which we and they live i know that the nation has a headache there are strikes and more strikes i know that some of these strikes are justifiableothers are not i have a suspicion that some of these strkes are agitated and caused by persons who are not interested in the american form of government these wish to bring about chaos and confusion and then destroy us they prefer a dictatorship they spurn democracy they are not all employeesamong them are employers i know and you know that there are many cases where the workers are receiving less than a living annual wage it is easy to compare the wage they got before the war and that they are now receiving such a comparison is not only unfair but dishonest we hear the enemies of labor shout from the housetops look at the high wages they are receiving but these do not tell you that the dollar is worth only 40 cents in purchasing power they do not tell you that in many cases the present wages paid are not more than sufficient to pay the rent on a decent place to live in let alone fuel clothing and food they tell us that the plumber is getting 2 50 an hour but they do not tell us that that 2 50 buys only as much as 1 would have bought in 1937 they do not tell you that many of the socalled whitecollar workers are in actual want because of the depreciated salaries and wages to these it is all right for themselves to take all that the traffic will bear they want cost plus for industries and cost minus for the farmer and the laborer i know that we have those who would go back to the dark ageswho prefer working slaves to working freemen these forget that it was free labor that produced not only food clothing and implements of war for our own army and navy but for the armies and navies of half of the world in no nation did the individual worker produce anything near that of the american farmer and laborer i still hope that either on this floor or in the senate we may get a fair and just bill i have consulted with some labor leaders of different organizations i find that almost without a single exception they agree that some legislation is necessary they agree that jurisdictional and wildcat strikes should be prohibited they agree that they should be held responsible and be given authority to prohibit such strikes they agree that violence in strikes must be stopped they are willing to assume responsibility if given authority to stop violence in all cases where the governor of a state or a mayor of a city fails to do his duty and uphold law and order if they had been given that responsibility and power then the outrages perpetrated at the allischalmers plant would not have taken place nor would the farmers have been prevented from bringing food into the city of new york a few years ago these leaders know that the public will no longer tolerate the disastrous effects of a strike that affects a large part or the nation as a whole they are willing that a law be passed thatwould set forth the terms and conditions under which an industry that does affect the welfare of the nation would be continued in operation during a strike i feel that we cannot justify our sup port of this bill and square it with our conscience except on the grounds of expediency you may ease your political conscience temporarily but the ghost will return and haunt you you will not be permitted to crucify labor upon the altar of false propaganda and slanderupon the blunders and mistakes of the industrialists labor has furnished its full quota of fighting men and its full quota in the field of production it performed a miracle it supplied half the world with arms and munitions and war implements oh i have heard the remark that the wise thing to do is to vote for this bill because the senate will improve it my answer is that we have no right to hide behind the skirts of the senate this house has done that on several occasions the responsibility is ours it is here now i hope that the bill will be recommitted to the committee and that it will bring in a simple bill that will be just to both labor and industrythat will do justice and protect the public i fear that in a moment of emotion and excitement we are about to pass a bill that will have farreaching consequences would it not be wise if this house took a 30day coolingoff perioda 30day coolingoff period from emotion and false propagandapropaganda that would have us go back to the dark ages in labor legislation congress cannot pass a law to make a person work if he does not wish toespecially not if he has a grievance such an attempt is contrary to our experience and contrary to human nature it never can be enforced except by a dictator and then only with a gun and club henry ford 2d on january 9 1946 in detroit discussing strikes before the society of automotive engineers said as we look at these problems in humrn relations we feel that the solution must be found through a closer understanding between management and labor if we cannot succeed by cooperation it doesnt seem likely that we can succeed by an exercise of force we cannot for example expect legislation to solve our problems laws which seek to force large groups of americans to do what they believe is unfair and against their best interests are not likely to succeed in fact such legislation can lead to exaggeration of the very problem it is designed to solve and when freemen give up the task of trying to get along with each other and pass the buck to government they surrender a substantial measure of their freedom in conclusion let us remember that we always enslave ourselves by enslaving others first there are too many who ask for the protection of the constitution when it comes to their rights but forget it when it comes to the rights of others may i beg you to once more observe the constitution there has been a growing tendency not only on the part of the executive but on the part of congress and the judiciary to attempt to hide behind the constitution when it serves their purpose and to throw it out of the window when it does not we have done fairly well for over 150 years under that instrument let us not now in a moment of emotional hysteria unconstitutionally crucify labor and in the end lose our own liberty it may take a little more courage to vote your honest conviction on this bill but in the end right will triumph the nation is and will recover its calmer and saner judgment the overwhelming majority of organized labor is just as much interested in the success of our government as we are whenever the time comes when love for our country and patriotism fall

workers who are both good and loyal citizens and conscientious and patriotic employees to have the activity of a few disloyal reflect upon the integrity of the majority would be in my opinion unthinkable under the terms of h r 3813 a separate and bipartisan body would be set up to investigate and determine the loyalties of those now employed and employed in the future by government the bill would grant to our country and its people the assuring and valued services of the federal bureau of investigation which would function as an investigatory agency in instances where ioyalty of an individual is questionable all of us know of the outstanding record of the federal bureau of investigation during war and all of us have the highest confidence in the integrity and ability of the members of the splendid force we know that if the federal bureau of investigation makes a report relative to an individual the facts contained will be accurate and unbiased it is important to note too that under the terms of h r 3813 individual rights are protected it grants the right of appeal to those who may stand accused of disloyalty it grants them the right of legal counsel of sworn testimony and of the right to submit affidavits and to call witnesses in their behalf it sets forth and defines disloyalty and establishes an orderly and lawfully procedure which will be uniform and fair for all it also gives congress final cognizance in handling this situation and enables congress to fulfill its sworn obligation to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states there are those who oppose this bill for political reasons contending that the recent presidential order concerning loyalty is sufficient to safeguard the nation yet those who defend the executive order procedure should be reminded that only a few short weeks before this order was issued by the president he brushed aside as inconsequential the disturbing and brazen activities of those radical elements all of us recognized as opposed to our system of government i would like to remind the gentlemen of the house that this measure has the indorsement of outstanding patriotic organizations such as the american legion the veterans of foreign wars and the disabled american veterans it has besides the full support of the national federation of federal employees representing the substantial group of those employed by government it is my personal conviction that this is not the time to gamble with the security of our country it is a time when loyalty is expected and must be exacted i believe this must be accomplished by the due processes of law in an orderly and fair manner and submit for your consideration that h r 3813 is legislation which should be adopted without delay"], [0.8624878525733948,
