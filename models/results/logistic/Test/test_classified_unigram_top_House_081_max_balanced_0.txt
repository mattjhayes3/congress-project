pensions to veterans who reached old age let me say at the outset that i deplore the rather reckless statements that have been made that this bill was conceived in hate vengeance and spite as a new member of congress it would hardly be my province to defend the gentleman from mississippi who heads our committee but several members of this body who have been here for many years inform me that our chairman has always battled for the rights of veterans that he h s always lent an attentive ear to the plight of those who served our country and its institutions in time of national emergency there may be those who question his judgment but certainly none can question his patriotism it should also be remembered that the american legion and vfw each had bills for consideration before our committee which went farther and which would have been more costly than this proposed legislation who among you today will say that the program of these two great service organizations was conceived in hate vengeance and spite i deplore again the wild and unsupported statements which have been made in the press and by individuals about the huge cost of this bill if you will remember it was at first stated that this legislation would cost from six to seven billions of dollars each year but when the veterans administration figured its probable cost the estimate was that in the peak year of 1990 the cost would be less than 4 50 3 000 000 and that over the first 50 years the average cost would be about 2 000 000 000 per year when that estimate was made no consideratfon was given to the present cost of oldage assistance today approximately 23 percent of all people in the united states of the age of 65 or over are now drawing this gratuity the average payments are about 45 per month or onehalf the amount specified in this bill so from each billion of estimated cost of the present bill should be deducted approximately 115 000 000 but this is not all in addition to that there would be saved the administration costs the veteran will automatically draw his payment it will not be necessary for a staff of trained investigators to swoop down upon him each month for a detailed financial statement and a paupers oath i might also add here that the administration has urged that the oldage assistance payments be materially boosted i think that this will be done and i do know that out in the states many legislatures are now boosting these payments all this will make a decided difference in the alleged added cost of this proposed legislation it should also be remembered that under extension 5 of the rating schedule of the veterans administration any veteran who reaches the age of 65 with a 10percent disability can now draw 72 per month providing his income does not exceed 1 000 per year if single or 2 500 per year in case he has dependents i do not know just what criteria may have been used by the va in figuring the cost of this pension but i do believe its figures are too high certainly we must admit that any man or woman who reaches the age of 65 will have a 10percent disability the income limitation therefore is all that could keep the veteran from drawing 72 per month my opinion is that the great majority of veterans will qualify so as to those veterans this bill merely means the payment of 90 per month instead of 72 per month or a difference of 18 when this bill was considered in committee the gentleman from new york proposed an amendment the effect of which would exclude from the benefits of this bill those veterans holding a discharge without honor that is the socalled blue discharge i opposed that amendment which was defeated by only two votes i opposed it because i know that many of those discharges were given without just cause however i want to say that i have since learned that a review board is considering those cases and it is correcting those inequities on a recent day it reviewed 15 cases and three of that number were changed to honorable discharges i am now ready to and will support the amendment if it is offered by the gentleman from new york this one item can effect another substantial saving another objection has been made to the bill in that it does not differentiate between the veteran who served 90 days and the veteran who served several years and that it does not differentiate between the veterans who remained in the united states and those who served in actual combat may i say to you that men and women in the armed forces were not arbiters of their own destiny they served where they were commanded to serve in the first world war i saw marines who had been in the service from 8 to 12 years who never got across they were too valuable in the training program in this country no two men saw identical service or suffered identical hardships if we were to adopt the policy of differentiation we would have to pass approximately 18 000 000 different laws to care for the veterans in bonus legislation the period of service can be taken into account but in pension legislation it must of necessity be a law which applies equally to all there must be a dividing line somewhere and we havemerely adopted the policy laid down years ago that those veterans who had at least 90 days of service would be eligible it has been said that we should only give to those in need i strongly disagree with that thought when you do this you place our veterans in the position of receiving a dole in fact such an enactment would be a waste of the paper upon which it was written he can already receive a dole at age 65 in the form of oldage assistance what we seek to do is to allow these veterans to spend their old age in honor dignity and decency you can never do that by sending him to a poorhouse or an old folks home or by the payment of a dole opponents of this legislation say that it would set the veteran apart from his fellow citizens i lately read an article which had been inserted in the appendix of the congressional record which was entitled there can be only one kind of americans this article was an editorial which appeared in the san francisco chronicle last month i quote a portion thereof the legion has resolutely opposed statism in the many formsnazi communist or whatever notwithstanding this pension proposal is exactly up the alley of statism it sets apart one group of americans as deserving of arbitrarily assigned special privilege it would make this group politically beholden to the government for the maintenance of its special financial status etc of all the silly inane fallacious and bleeding statements that have been made to discredit this bill the above ought to win the prize i hope we may later award to the editorial writer of the san francisco chronicle a pair of celluloid fire tongs they ought to be as effective as his arguments these men in wartime could be trusted with hand grenades and 155millimeter howitzers they could be trusted at the controls of a b29 or a submarine but at age 65 they cannot be trusted with 90 in their hands no if they had this much money to spend for food clothing medical care and housing they might set up some fascist communist or superstate certainly this legislation will set the veteran apart from other citizens in this country and why should it not these opponents say that it is class legislation that it is wrong to give added benefits to any one class of our citizens and members of the committee when the war clouds hung low these young men were r special class were they not they were the cream of our young manhood they were the salt of the earth they were the defenders of democracy shall we say that the respect we gave them then and the glory that was theirs must diminish as old age creeps upon them yes they were a special class they were a class of people who went forth to battle for the rights of humanity they were the class who went forth to battle for democracy they were a special class who were called upon to spend long grueling hours in the training camps in this country and later perhaps to be used as cannon fodder while those who remained at home could reap the harvest of quick and easy profits if we are to have wars involving this country i think we ought to draft wealth and industry just as we draft men to be soldiers we ought to draft every ablebodied man in america and place him where his talents would serve best we ought to draft every farmer and every farm every munitions worker and every munitions plant every factory worker and every factory plant we ought to draft every person or thing that has productive capacity i say that we ought to as nearly as possible finance these wars as we go the lawyer the doctor the grocer the baker and candlestick maker should all get the same pay in wartime in my judgment the private and officer should receive the same pay yes even members of congress if this happened it might destroy some of the incentive that certain people have for war it might even allow us to escape some wars but assume that it did not we would at least all be contributing more equally to the war effort and there would not be the argument which now exists for bonuses xcv 187 and pensions to those who actually bore arms mr chairman and members of the committee it is my sincere judgment that so long as we pursue our present policy of taking our choice manhood and drafting them into the armed services at a mere pittance while those who remain at home are free to make all the money the traffic will bear then just so long will it be our duty to vote bonuses and pensions for our veterans it has been further said we must not forget the men who were on the home front they are just as much entitled to consideration as are the veterans many of them made great contributions to the war effort well let us see about the homefront boys i know of one person in a small town who had a 10by12 hamburger joint when the war started at the end of the war that individual was worth more than 50 000 what about the homefront boys in the munitions plants they made from 20 to 30 per day that was a great sacrifice was it not yes i have heard farmers talk about their great contribution to the war effort i do not speak disparagingly of the farmers i own the farm upon which i was born and following the first world war i homesteaded in wyoming but i have heard them brag about the long hours they put in to raise hogs and cattle and chickens and grain so that the boys at the front could be well fed if you can recall the prices they received for those products you will agree that they were pretty well paid for the sacrifice which they made certainly their profits ran considerably higher than the 50 per month which our soldiers received there are those who say that the veterans themselves will pay this bill if this be true then why all the hysteria my investigation reveals that in my section of missouri some 95 percent of the veterans favor this bill in fact the three letters of criticism which i have received complain that this bill does not go as far as the legion and vfw bills if the veterans are paying for their own pensions no one else should object however sensible people realize that veterans will not foot this bill they will only pay a proportionate part thereof the major part of this expense will be borne by some multimillionaires and some of the prosperous gentlemen who were made rich by this war it will be paid in great part by those who waxed fat while the doughboy was made lean in tramping the rough terrain in training maneuvers and on a hundred battlefields in actual combat i do not believe that a large percent of our veterans are heavy income taxpayers these boys had no chance for the big money there are those who say that the passage of this bill will strain our national economy there are those who say it will entail a severe and backbreaking tax burden in the peak year of 1990 this bill will not cost the american taxpayers as much as we are spending this year to rehabilitate europe and build up those countries who were our enemies in the late war i say to you that any nation which can spend billions of dollars to raise the standard of living in europe can spend an equal amount to insure that our veterans may spend their declining days in dignity and decency i say to you that if we can spend billions to build up those nations who were our enemies in the late war and to make strong again those inhabitants who tried to strike down democracy in the world we can spend an equal amount to insure security for those men and women who served our country in its hour of need i would rather be taxed 50 cents out of every dollar which i am now making or which i will make in the future than to see one veteran in this country be in want i would rather be taxed until it hurts than to see one defender of his country be buried in a paupers grave i say to you mr chairman and members of this committee that the failure to pass this legislation will be the greatest blow to patriotism this country has ever known if we break faith with these men we shall have forsaken the long and timehonored policy of this country we shall be saying to the young prospective soldier of tomorrow we will use you when you are young and fit when you are strong and bold we will place you in our armies to fight our battles while the rest of us remain at home and receive lush profits from the war and then upon your return we shall expect you to get along as best you can some days ago i read about a group of nonveteran civilservice employees who had formed an organization to protect their alleged rights as against the encroachment of the veterans here is a group of men and women who lolled in the safety and security of a civilservice position while these boys were fighting to keep free government a going concern yet these homefront folks now band together to make certain that no veteran shall stake a claim on their holy reservation i only say to them shame upon shame there have been many instances when the rights of veterans have been trampled upon if we are to be fair with them if we are to give them security in their old age let us pass no flimsy legislation let us pass no halfway measures let us have no needs clause that can be argued and bandied about or no payments dependent on physical condition that give doctors something to quibble about let us pass a measure that means something more than doubletalk it has been said that the consideration of this proposed legislation is premature that we are trying to broaden the socialsecurity program and that in time we can envelop all the veterans in that my answer to that is that fully a third of the veterans are from the farms this class has never been covered and probably never will be even if they could be covered immediately most of the world war i veterans would have no time to qualify for more than a mere pittance and many could not qualify at all today many of the older veterans are in a sorrowful situation many of them have reached the age where their services are no longer desired it is too late in life for them to get started in any business of their own they have passed the age when they might hope to get credit and start any business of their own social security can never be the answer to these men who have reached or are fast approaching old age for them it is either a pension or oldage assistance may i say again that i do not want any veteran in this country to be forced on direct relief or public assistance in that manner they deserve better i know that some of the young veterans in this congress have said and perhaps will say on the floor today patriotism is not a thing that can be bought or can be paid for my ccuntry owes me nothing because i happened to be in the service so long as i received no injuries i do not consider that i am any better than the man who did not go in of course when one is basking in the sunshine of success and holding a position of honor at 15 000 per year it is just a little difficult to understand the plight of the aged veteran flushed with victory we cannot always sympathize with defeat in the first world war i volunteered in the navy as an apprentice seaman i was too young for the draft some 25 years later i volunteered as a private in the army when too old to have been drafted my patriotism was not for sale in either instancewhen i quit the university for 28 per month or quit a law practice for 50 per month i hope that it may never be necessary for me to apply for any pension if a pension law be passed but i can frankly say to you that should adversity hit me and i did need help i would feel that my government was not playing the game quite fairly with me or my comrades if we were forced to take public assistance the german population that were our enemies in two world wars are now receiving a dole god forbid that the veterans of this country in their old age shall be placed in the same class"], [0.023636579513549805, 0.9763634204864502, 1, "regardless of what may be said in general debate or in the committee of the whole house in the consideration of h r 5856 the minimumwageandhour billthe legislation proposed is beneficial not harmful it is economically sound and politically wise this legislation is democracys answer to the cry of millions of underpaid underprivileged and in many instances undernourished american workingmen and women it is the fulfillment of the democrat partys pledge that this great class of our citizenship now at the foot of the economic ladder be assured their fair share of the greatest prosperity ever enjoyed by our american nation or any other nation on the face of the earth since this legislation h r 3190now h r 5856was reported out of the committee on education and labor it has been subjected to a vicious attack of misinformation and lack of information it is not if you please a smear campaign but a fear campaign the late president roosevelt once said what the american people need fear most is fear itself could it be possible that the american people have in the short spanof 17 years forgotten the bold determined steps taken in 1933 to lift us from the depths of despair and put us once more on the road to economic stability despite the fact that our nation 4 years after the close of world war ii is still enjoying great prosperity and despite the fact that there are more than 59 000 000 men and women gainfully employed we hear on every hand and i regret to say even from the well of the house dire croakings from these disciples of doom some say i fear we are headed for another bust and still others say things dont look too good with others it is a wishbone instead of a backbone this is no time to retreat this is a time for bold decisive action many of the thousands of business firms and individuals that make up the several categories of our economic structure are being used deliberately by a few topflight corporations industries trade associations and individuals who are covered by the act in their campaign to highpressure the congress by having their business associates not covered by the provisions of h r 5856 aid them in pulling their chestnuts out of the fire i feel that this bill would have overwhelming support were it not for the campaign of misrepresentation which has been going on around the country it is a campaign which has been inspired and directed by lobbyists for special interests it is a campaign which this congress must ignore if it is to legislate in the interest of the american people much of the opposition is pure propaganda still other protests are unjustified take the case of the organized farm groups not a single farm activity is covered in this bill yet we find these groups playing the game with the united states chamber of commerce the nam and other affiliated~ groups let me remind the farm groups in this house that the farmer has a minimum guaranty in the form of parity all the unorganized and underpaid workersseveral million of themare asking is that they too be guaranteed a minimum return not to assure them a profit as in the case of the farmers but to enable them to live as decent american citizens what good my farmer friend is a guaranteed price if the workingman has no money with which to buy you know full well that the answer is increased purchasing power such as this legislation seeks to provide when economic chaos engulfed us in 1932 president roosevelt said he wanted to do something for the men and women at the foot of the economic ladder here my colleagues is an opportunity for you to emulate the humanitarianism of our late lamented leader you may call it new deal or fair deal to me it is just good plain oldfashioned american horse sense today more than 28 percent of our american families are earning less than 2 00 annually this is even 1 000 less than the amount set as a living standard for the average family under the present wage minimum of 40 cents weekly earnings are a pitiful 16 not enough for the bare necessities of life even a 75cent minimum and 30 per week is not enough to meet todays soaring prices it will to some extent ease the burden of feeding clothing and educating the children in millions of american homes once again we face the issue of whether we shall place material things above human welfare lincoln said something about this being a country of the people and for the people i am sure he never said anything about it being a government for entrenched wealth my colleagues on the left center aisle who are now divided over whether it is to be a taft approach or a dewey approach could render some real service if they talked and voted along the line of a lincoln approach there seems to be a disposition on the part of some members of the other side of this chamber that the committee has done a terrible thing in recommending that the benefits of this act be brought to more workers they seem to feel that the benefits of the act should be brought to as few workers as possible some members of the committee were almost frank enough to admit that they wanted the whole act repealed others were content to offer amendments reducing the coverage of the act one member actually proposed that a million workers that have been under the act ever since 1938 should be removed from its protection all of this may explain why hearings were held by the committee of the eightieth congress and not even a committee report was issued let alone a bill passed the president of the united states has called on the congress not only to increase the minimumwage provisions of the act to at least 75 cents an hour but also to extend the coverage as widely as posible i feel that the committee could have gone much further than it did in extending the coverage of the law the situation today is different from that wartime situation again we have the case of men competing for jobs again the country faces the danger that in their eagerness for work men will take jobs for anything an employer will offer and that gradually the wage structure that has been built up will collapse i know of no better way to prevent this collapse than by an absolute floor wage set at 75 cents an hour it would even be better if this floor could be a dollar an hour but even 75 cents an hour will help stop a further collapse in the purchasing power of our workers if there would be such a collapse the farmers of america will be among the first to suffer although of course they already have a minimum wage in the pricesupport program the truth is that the 75cent minimum wage will directly benefit 1 500 000 workers who are now subject to the act the bill will also benefit many additional workers in industries and occupations which are not now subject to the minimumwage provisions of the act i am supporting this bill nonetheless because it represents the views of the majority of the committee and while i would prefer that the committee had brought in more workers i feel the job done by the committee is a good one and that it should be supported by all of us while time still permits i must hasten to remind my colleagues that the opposition to this legislation is centered in a substitute proposal that will be offered in the committee of the whole by the gentleman from texas representative lucas as a member of the committee on education and labor i was one of several who appeared before the rules committee and asked that an open rule be granted so as to permit the gentleman from texas to offer his proposal a study of his proposal even though he has at the last minute changed it to meet the changes in the committee bill h r 5856 still represents in coverage all of the views and pet schemes of those who appeared before the committee as witnesses in opposition to drafting a fair and just minimumwageandhour bill in the matter of a minimum wage his proposal to tie wages to the cost of living is one that has already been denounced by senator taft the republican leader in the senate as one that is impracticable and economically unsound i will oppose his substitute on the ground thatfirst it will bring economic instability second it will lack adequate facts on vhich to base a wage scale third instead of uniformity it will create confusion by providing dual administration as between the department of agriculture and the department of labor fourth in wage categories of 75 cents and less it will preclude the right to bargain collectively because the rate will follow the cost of living index labor is interested in more than just the right to live fifth it will defeat a major objective of this legislation by removing from coverage 1 000 000 individuals now covered in the present law despite the fact that our nation has had a minimum wage and fair labor standards act on the books for the past 11 years there appears to be a great number of our population who think that h r 5856 is new legislation or a new venture in the field of both economic and managementlabor relations before we vote on this bill i want every congressman to know the facts the facts are available to everyone who is interested in facts not propaganda the issue is clear my friends you must by your vote on this floor let america and your constituents know whether you stand for human welfare or organized wealth every congressman interested in the welfare of the working people of america and in the welfare of our nation as a whole should support h r 5856 it contains vitally needed changes in the fair labor standards act which have been long overdue let us pass this bill at once and in so doing demonstrate to the american people that we can ignore the pressure of the special interests in legislating for the american people as a whole"],

constituent urging speedy action on the recornmendations proposed by that distinguished group of publicspirited citizens who comprised the commission on organization of the executive branch of the government every individual knows from his own experience and contact with government agencies that there is room for improvement in the working of government every taxpayer rightly insists that he should get full value for his tax dollar efficiency and economy have become watchwords of the american people they recognize that to meet the difficult problems of the atomic age our democratic government must be sound and strong and efficiently organized the hoover commission set out with a mandate from congress to study our complex government machinery and to make recommendations for overhauling it agencies and functions were to be regrouped by major purpose to reduce their number to eliminate overlap and duplication wherever possible in short to make the structure of government more compact and coherent and more amenable to effective management by the chief executive within each department and agency lines of authority and accountability were to be clearly drawn centering full authority and responsibility in the executive head and allowing him to delegate to subordinates adequate staff assistance was to be provided and the management activities of government improved and strengthened these broad objectives were laudable commanding support and approval not only by the people but by the congress and the administration the congress established the legal framework for the exercise of presidential initiative in government reorganization by passing the reorganization act of 1949 other vital reorganization bills were passed holding forth the real promise of large savings prominent among these enactments were the military unification law and the law establishing the general services administration as chairman of the subcommittee on executive and legislative reorganization i have been privileged to take an active part in the legislative work on reorganization the president for his own part promptly directed the departments and agencies of the executive branch to search out and put into operation every possible administrative improvement he appointed an eminent committeeof citizens to advise him on administrative management and to keep watch on reorganization progress in the executive branch one series of reorganization plans was submitted to the congress by the president last year and another series is pending before us now experts in public administration say that we have accomplished more in the past year by way of government reorganization than in any like period in all our history mr hoover himself while pointing out that the job of government reorganization cannot be done overnight that it is a longterm process has said recently that the progress made by this congress and administration to date is truly astonishing president truman estimated in his message accompanyirg the 21 reorganization plans of 1950 that approval of these plans will bring us to the halfway mark in carrying out the hoover cmmission recommendations now we are witnessing a most strange and peculiar event the presidents reorganization plans submitted in good faith and with serious regard for the objectives sought by the hoover commission are being assailed from every quarter c the business community one group opposes one plan another group opposes another plan the loud lip service for the hoover commission report in general has changed into loud lip noises against the hoover commission reports in particular many of those organizations who so dutifully went on record in support of the hoover commission report are now finding reasonsat least their washington lobbyists and spokesmen are finding reasonswhy one or another of the presidents reorganization plans should be opposed and rejected the american bankers association has undertaken a grassroots campaign to work up opposition to reorganization plan no 1 the organized bankers do not like this plan because they do not have faith in the administrative supervision that some future secretary of the treasury might exercise over the office of comptroller of the currency i say future secretary because in this instance secretary of the treasury snyder shares the views of the banking community he has joined then in expressing opposition to reorganization plan no 1 ignoring the judgment of his own chief executive and the director of the budget the patent lawyers of this country do not trust the secretary of commerce they see in reorganization plan no 5 a device whereby the secretary of commerce will award patents to his political friends and tear down the american freeenterprise system the shipowning interests would perhaps like to join in the hue and cry by opposing reorganization plan no 21 transferring the maritime commission to the department of commerce they have been less vocal i dare say because the quality of administration of ship subsidies in the presently constituted maritime commission is something less than is to be desired exsenator joe ball has articulated the views of those who do not trust the attorney general of the united states his business letter i am told expresses opposition to reorganization plan no 2 because he sees in it a device whereby the federal bureau of investigation will come too much under the thumb of the attorney general the united states chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers are opposed to reorganization plan no 12 relating to the national labor relations board because they like the administrative absurdity created by the tafthartley act better than they like good government these and other assorted business and financial organizations are also opposed to reorganization plan no 6 because they do not accept the hoover commission recommendations that the department of labor should be resurrected and the secretary of labor given full authority to administer certain laws relating to labor a secretary of labor in their eyes has less integrity and less conscientiousness as a public servant than the secretary of some other department i do not know where the big farm organizations stand on reorganization plan no 4 but it is safe to say that they do not greet with joyous acclaim the centering of full authority and responsibility over the governments agricultural activities in the secretary of agriculture nor will the mining interests greet with joyous acclaim reorganization plan no 3 which would make the bureau of mines among other interior units wholly responsible to the secretary of the interior perhaps the same can be said for some of the reclamation interests which have been backstopping the bureau of reclamation in its hardly concealed opposition to the proposed cva which the secretary of interior has fully endorsed i have been reliably informed that opposition has been expressed by one group or another to 15 of the 21 reorganization plans submitted by the president and pending before the congress my latest count shows there are now 17 separate resolutions of disapproval which have been formerly introduced in either the house or senate on 14 of the 21 reorganization plans i venture to say that more such resolutions of disapproval will be forthcoming as the various interests in opposition become more vocal it is the right and privilege of every member to introduce such resolutions i do not question the good faith of any member who may take objection each case may have some merit from the standpoint of the group affected the question i wish to raise is where will this process end mr speaker if every particular group or private interest is to be satisfied by a resolution and by a vote of disapproval the work of the hoover commission will go down the drain the 2 000 000 spent by that commission will have gone for nought the grandiloquent sentiments of support for the hoover commission which so many business organizations were quick to make will turn out to be the hollow voices of hypocrisy a citizens committee has been established for some time to educate the public on the findings of the hoover coinmission and to mobilize support for the commissions recommendations many solid and respectable businessmen are to be found among the sponsors of the citizens committee they have contributed money to the organization they have spread the gospel of the hoover commission far and wide but now in many cases they find their own business interests opposed to reorganization perhaps that explains the fact that the citizens committee has been less than a bold advocate of the presidents reorganization plans as these plans come before our committee on expenditures and hearings are held on the resolutions of disapproval we try to hear all views despite the limited time allowed under the reorganization act oftentimes the points advanced by opponents of a plan are sincerely made and worthy of serious consideration nevertheless i must say that it is amusing and almost pathetic to note some of the arguments which are being used to justify opposition to these basic recommendations of the hoover commission the twinge of conscience is readily apparent of course they support the hoover commissionbut some accuse the president of bad faith as did a spokesman for the united states chamber of commerce when he told our committee on expenditures that reorganization plan no 12 was a device to get denham general counsel of the national labor relations board some profess to be doubtful of the legality of a proposed reorganization and as creators of the doubt urge against the acceptance of a measure of doubtful legality eagerly they search the four corners of the hoover commission reports the reports of the task forces the staff memoranda to find some phrase some shade of meaning some equivocation that will give a breath of support to their views some deny that economy or efficiency will result from the proposed reorganization and cover their retreat by stoutly maintaining that even economy or efficiency are too high in price to pay for the immeasurable harm that allegedly will be done by the particular reorganization where the hoover commission made a recommendation covering all analogous departments or agencies arguments now are put forth to the effect that this or that agency should be exempt either because it is so different from the rest or because the hoover commission did not single it out for special mention when the general recommendation was made behind these and similar arguments lies a simple and understandable desire by many of the special groups concerned to let well enough alone to oppose any change in organization lest an entrenched interest or a favored position be disturbed in relationships carefully built up with the agencies of government more than that i detect frequently behind these arguments of opposition a lack of faith in the basic principles of government organization which the hoover commission so clearly and repeatedly advocated the coinmission went ahead of the assumption that democratic government must be based on trust not on mistrust the commission believed that the placement of full authority in the executive beads of regrouped departments and agencies was good not bad because accountability goes with authority we cannot hold a public administrative official fully responsible unless we give him the necessary and complete authority to do his job the opponents of these reorganization plans too often take the opposite view it seems almost as if they cultivate conflict and diffusion of responsibility in administration because they do not really approve of the law designed to carry out a given public policy where they cannot succeed in getting the law rescinded or modified they seem determined to prevent its proper execution it frequently happens that private interests affected by a law build up an advantageous relationshipadvantageous to themwith the public agency or commission that administers the law the organized bankers of this country quite frankly regard the comptroller of the currency as their sponsor in washington d c to cite another example the interstate commerce commission is regarded by some as overfriendly to the railroads i would suppose that these agencies were created to protect the public interest rather than to act as the sponsor or guardian of some private interest naturally these groups that enjoy a favored position are reluctant to have any change any reorganization that might jeopardize their position this leads me to observe that if we are sincere about our concern for the objectives of the hoover commission if we are going to get the job of reorganization completed we must hold high the concept of the public interesthigh above the clamor of private interests opposed to specific reorganization plans we must protect the main body of the hoover commission recommendations from being torn to shreds as if it were a carcass surrounded by snarling jackals let me emphasize as i have done before that we are not committed to adopt each and every proposal made by the hoover commission each of these 300 or more recommendations is to be considered upon its merits sincere persons may differ about the worth and desirability of a particular reorganization proposal there is no uniquely correct answer to every problem of governmental organization my remarks are not a brief for the hoover commission proposals in their entirety instead i plead for preservation of those basic principles which guided the commissions work to preserve those basic principles we cannot allow ourselves to say that the secretary of commerce or the secretary of labor or some other department or agency head is not to be trusted with full authority over the affairs of his department or agency we cannot justifiably oppose the reorganization plans of the president which are designed to establish the organization framework for good administration throughout the executive branch let us have these considerations in mind when we come to pass judgment in this house on those reorganization plans let us have an anxious regard for the public interest which must be served above all else"], [0.026706337928771973, 0.973293662071228, 1, "now i wish to state that had the chairmans bill not been in order today under house resolution 5 this rule never would have been granted but the majority of the committee on rules the republicans who were working closely with the three democrats did not want it to come up they did not want the bill called up under the change in rules today they wanted a rule and in desperation i succeeded in obtaining a majority in favor of the amended rule now before us now those are the facts i myself did not care for the committee to grant a rule on it i was willing to consider the bill under the new amended rules of the house but the majority of the committee opposed to the legislation wanted to gum up the proceedings now in view of those facts i am amazed at these gentlemen trying to make so much hullabaloo about what has taken place in the rules committee i am convinced it is done for the sole purpose of misleading the members from the real facts the bill before us h r 5856 is a compromise measure as i said before and it has eliminated many of the provisions contained in h r 3190the original lesinski bill which provided for a broad extension of the scope of our present minimum wage law h r 5856 has excluded various coverages not included in actual interstate commerce the socalled borderline cases involving the application of the commerce clause i am told are excluded and the past confusion that resulted in this regard will be eliminated by this lesinski bill h r 5856 would bring under minimum wage coverage about 150 000 seamen and about 90 000 employees engaged in the onshore processing or handling of fishery products it would add some new exemptions but would result nevertheless in a net addition of about 675 000 workers to the protection of the overtime provisions among the groups of employees who would be placed under the overtime requirement would be more than half a million employees of motor carriers more than a hundred thousand employees engaged in handling or processing of fishery products onshore as i said before and more than a hundred thousand employees handling or processing farm products h r 5856 would not change the established meanings which the term commerce and the production of goods for commerce have under the fair labor standards act the lesinski bill provides for adequate child labor provisions and improves the child labor provision relative to exemption for employment in agriculture by recasting it on a outside of school hours basis h r 5856 contains three important improvements in the administrative provisions of the act first it gives the administering agency authority to collect wages due under the act second it provides rulemaking authority similar to that provided many other agencies providing greater certainty to employers and employees alike and third it would make the secretary of labor responsible generally for administration thereby accomplishing one of the proposals of the hoover commission if i did not realize that the committee on education and labor has worked diligently for many months and made every effort to eliminate every possible objectionable feature in the hope of obtaining unanimous approval i would say that they have not been broadened enough i personally feel that this bill does not cover as extensive an area as i had hoped it would i want to congratulate the majority of the committee on education and labor and especially its chairman the gentleman from michigan the gentleman from texas judge combs and the gentleman from west virginia who from the evidence they presented to the rules committee satisfied me that they have given a tremendous amount of time and study to every provision in this bill as a matter of fact i never in my many years of service witnessed such an able and outstanding presentation of facts i hope that during the general debate that follows all members who desire to vote right on this legislation will give clear and close attention to the explanation of these gentlemen and the reasons underlying each and every provision in the bill i understand that the gentleman from texas who is serving his second term is setting himself up above the committee on education and labor and has broadly publicized the fact that he will offer the socalled lucas bill as a substitute the gentleman from texas first introduced h r 4272 but after the committee on education and labor revamped their original bill h r 3190 and introduced h r 5856 which is before us now and as i stated before represents an adjustment in the differences of the members of the committee on education and labor in order to attain harmony the gentleman from texas appeared before the committee on rules and stated that the bill he originally introduced as a substitute will be withdrawn in favor of another bill h r 5894 which he would introduce and offer as a substitute for h r 5856 this bill h r 5894 would make more exemptions than the original lucas bill this satisfies me that the committee bill is the only bill that should be adopted by the house i understand further that the lucas bill embodies a sliding scale which means nothing more than annoyance trouble and confusion the complications which a constantly changing minimum rate would introduce into the administration of the act would make it impossible to achieve an effective degree of enforcement the confusion which would be created by frequent changes in the minimumwage level would confound any attempt to enforce the act and leave the question of good faith always in doubt thus the entire attempt of congress to provide protection to workers and employers through fair labor standards would be nullified by this device such a provision would favor the unscrupulous employer and discriminate against the fair one it must be realized by all that a minimum wage of 75 cents per hour only amounts to 30 per week if a worker is fortunate enough to be gainfully employed all week many are not in view of the prevailing high cost of living and in view of the passage of the gore agricultural bill which further increases the cost of food to the consumer no one can honestly and justly maintain that the minimum asked herein is too high or that the wage earner will earn too much as a matter of fact most wage earners have large families and with a family of four or five it is virtually impossible for him to provide even half decently for his family on 30 per week unfortunately many of them do not work an entire week of course only a few wage earners earn less than the minimum provided for in this bill as president truman said in his midyear economic report the life and spirit of the american economy is progress and expansion the presidents statement is witnessed by a letter which i received this morning from the national city bank of new york relative to economic conditions and government finance the monthly letter stated as follows the business news during july has borne out indications that began to appear in june that the handtomouth buying policies and reduction of inventories since the first of the year were clearing the way for an upturn of demand in many lines for the first time since the slump set in buying in substantial volume appeared in nonferrous metals primary textiles and various other industries bringing firmer prices in numerous cases and a better feeling throughout business generally however there are some to be sure who maintain that if a recession comes the employers will not be able to pay a minimum of 75 cents per hour i hope to god that will not and must not happen because it is certainly for the best interests of our great country that the wage earners should receive decent pay this provides greater purchasing power which in turn aids business and creates a demand for the goods and necessities of life this logically and it is a basic economic principle means more employment thus a higher minimum wage helps not only the wage earner but aids business manufacturers and our farmers as well as a result let me state needed food and other necessities of life are not denied the average person this bill will also aid in the maintenance and continuance of our countrys great national income which everyone recognizes will materially provide us with continuous prosperity and necessary income for our government so as to enable us to remain in a healthy economic condition and at the same time properly execute the duties that belong to the government consequently this bill will from every viewpoint aid not only underpaid labor but it will provide continuous absorption of our production and as i said before more business and prosperity to all after giving careful thought and consideration to the evidence presented on behalf of h r 5856the lesinski billi most earnestly urge that the committee bill be not further weakened by any substitute and further that it will have the vote of every fairminded member regardless on what side he may sit"], [0.027636170387268066, 0.9723638296127319, 1, "that has always been a worthy purpose indulged in by the government of the united states few bills before congress have been upported with such little enthusiasm for the direct beneficiaries after all yugoslavia is a communist state and a dictatorship although this nation maintains normal diplomatic and commercial relations with yugoslavia this bill in no way implies approval of titos internal policies further there is no guaranty implicit in this measure this bill requires a tough decision it is an expensive one it is not a sure thing but because of the difficulties the burden is placed nevertheless on this congress that burden is a part of democracy and an essential part if you lived in russia you would not have to trouble yourself over the finely balanced processes of foreign policy you would leave all the tough questions to your masters in the kremlin this nation must see the world situation steadily and whole and yet not become so preoccupied with the whole picture that it loses track of the particular problems of particular situations and yet no foreign policy of this nation can be justified unless it looks toward the strengthening and survival of our own nation we must constantly strive to insure that the nations with which we are alined always have the superior power a nation must give heed not only to its goals but also to its means of achieving them that means power for power is a capacity to achieve intended results we want our nation to play a role of powernot of power as an end in itself but as a means to wise and just ends our government must look to its military strength it must seek the support of other nations it must be willing to help them as they need help in providing the means to persevere toward our common goals our government also must act prudently to preserve and develop the internal strength of the nation it must seek at all times to act in the areas where americans are united as a people it cannot afford to fragment the popular support which is the ultimate source of all national strength let me tell you what i think is the most important thing for us to keep in mind about our power there is no way we can avoid having it count poweras i said beforemeans the capacity to achieve ones intentions a nation which has power and yet withholds ituses its power nevertheless it uses it on the side of adversary forces by withholding aid to yugoslavia the united states would really throw its power on the side of the kremlin which would capitalize on the weakness of yugoslavia as much as we dislike tito it is to the advantage of this nation to have tito in belgrade instead of stalin today the cheapest thing we have to sacrifice is money our nations youth our freedoms our institutions are ever so much more precious assets next to russia yugoslavia has the strongest standing army in europe it is composed of more than 30 divisions this aid is justified by political military and strategic reasons as well as humanitarian ones yugoslavia occupies a highly strategic position in europe it has common borders with italy austria greece bulgaria rumania hungary and albania the continuation of yugoslavias independence certainly works definite advantages to italy trieste and austria an independent yugoslavia blocks russias domination of the adriatic and the mediterranean the civil war in greece came to a close when tito blocked his frontiers to the greek communists you have heard and will hear more in this debate that tito is a communist that his country is a police station that he may realine with stalin that what we give him may he used against us that he may be killed and the politburo may take over anyway but as i said earlier we are giving this aid to tito with our eye wide open and from a sense of realism and not because we have any affection for him or his system of government tito however cannot go back to the soviet union all testimony is that the break between him and stalin is definite while it is true that any assistance that we give yugoslavia would be beneficial to stalin were he to take over yugoslavia it should be kept in mind that the same argument holds for every other nation in the world which has received aid from this nation however if yugoslavia goes down the positions of greece italy france and germany are in still greater danger as well as the entire middle east there are some things in the bill that do not please me although the drought accounts in the main for their food shortages yet collectivization and too rapid industrialization are also to blame an amendment should be introduced and supported to the end that any measures which would tend to worsen yugoslavias food and economic position should be prohibited as well as one to the effect that nothing in this act implies approval of titos regime or the policies pursued by it it can easily be seen that foreign policy is a vast and delicate business its complexity goes beyond the limits of any one man or any group it requires the best wisdom of all of us at this critical time in the history of our nation and western civilization i again plead for our nation to rise above the level of party considerations the fact is that men of good will in both parties have perceived the necessity of establishing a more stable basis for legislative consideration of foreign policy than would be possible if such issues were approached in the context of party bickering the bipartisan foreign policy has enabled americans to stand together in facing the worlds problems the congressthat is most of the members of congresshave sought to find the precepts of our world policy not in the narrow range of partisan striving but in a broad framework of patriotic endeavor not all of the members of congress have abided by that principle some have preferred the old habits of mutual distrust between the parties in foreign as well as domestic affairs their minds and hearts still operate in the framework of 30 years ago you will remember the tragedy of that era resulting from the circumstance that men in positions of great political power in our nation sought to raise party advantage above national welfare and international peace the conspiracy to wreck the results of president wilsons leadership was set in motion even before the terms of peace had been developed men whose skill was in excess of their principles whose partisanship was vastly greater than their patriotism managed to guide that conspiracy to success the result was a chilling of mens hopes everywhere a default of leadership on the part of this nation through the fallow years of the 1920s our nation went ahead on the assmuption that it was not involved in the deterioration of the situation elsewhere on the globe that assumption was blasted with the coming of world war ii which was the opening phase of the bitter ordeal in which we are still involved yet there are some who would write off the intervening facts and return nostalgically to the isolationism of the twenties fortunately these are a minority there are others who would share in the bipartisan foreign policy when it is to their advantage but would turn their backs upon it whenever a minor tactical gain might be scored in the contention between parties these are half in and half out of the bipartisar approach these are wont to share the credit for all successes and to disavow any part in the disappointments they are wont also to regard the bipartisan idea of the foreign policy as an arrangement in which the constitutionally responsible officers must give hostages to the minority they regard any refusal to give way to minority dictation as a breach of faith they regard the bipartisan foreign policy as a warrant to raise their voices in condemnation whenever they wish and yet to claim immunity to any rejoinder yet these have not been the prevailing moods our nation has presented a continuity of policy and a determination of effort which are quite in contrast to the default of responsibility that obtained after versailles a generation ago this does not mean that there has not also been a shortsighted approach to bipartisanship by the executive branch of our government while the direction and execution of foreign policy is within the executive branch the congress must implement legislate and appropriate to make foreign policy effective congress has been neglected too often consultation and briefing after the fact yes but consultation before the fact no an effective foreign policy is too important not to take into account the views of those who have legislative power the responsibility should be placed on congressional shoulders too the executive branch has given too little attention to the realities of the legislative process this oversight should be rectified at once further each tick of time makes our job so much harder complete mobilization controls taxes a price and wage freeze and even rollbacks should be put into effect without a moments delay we are in a national emergency strong leadership will galvanize the entire people to action to avert the threatening tragedy and progressing toward the goal of a just peace based on a widening opportunity will require the best thoughts and the most earnest efforts of all fhen and women who can rise above party the job is more than democrats alone can do it is more than republicans alone can do it is a job for all americans acting together it requires a steadiness of purpose above the vagaries of party fortunes that is why men of good will in both major parties must continue to place our foreign policy on a higher basis than party advantage"], [0.027992308139801025, 0.972007691860199, 1, "mr chairman the matter that brings me before the congress today is not new as a member of the seventyninth congress in 1945 and as a rank tyro in legislative procedure i endeavored to establish certain safeguards under the reciprocal trade agreements act for some of the major industries of my district and my native state of west virginia aside from the dubious honor of calling attention to the socalled escape clause in the mexican agreement of 1945 i failed to obtain any relief the manner in which this escape clause is being administered in existing reciprocal treaties leads me to wonder if i even won anythingeven though the escape clause has been written into all agreements since 1945 i never like to criticize unless 1 offer constructive substitutes while the years subsequent to 1945 have added more gray to my fastthinning hair i sincerely hope they have also given me greater information and wisdom with which to plead the cause of these much harassed industries what in the war year of 1945 was describ2d by one of my opponents in debate as a mere skin irritation on our economy bids fair in these postwar years to break out into festering sores that will blight great sections of our industrial life thereby causing unemployment reduced purchasing power and destroy the economic wellbeing of thousands of americas skilled workmen once more i crave your attention while i endeavor to depict not only what is happening to the woodworking pottery and handmade glass industries of our nation but what is sure to happen to these sorely pressed trades if h r 1211 now before you is approved in its present form i am unofficially informed that the state of oklahoma is greatly worried where state revenues derived from a production or severance tax on oil are dwindling and threaten to hamper governmental operations it is clearly apparent to the members that this protest is not just an isolated instance were it not for the apparent haste by which this pending legislation is being rushed through the congress i could place in the record scores of instances to show where other of our basic industries are being and will be affected by this legislation in formulating a tariff policy we have to contend with a problem peculiarly our ownthe high standard of american lifewhich expressed in terms of any money in comparison to an ounce of gold shows we are willing to pay more for services and merchandise than any other country in the world such a status is an invitation for the rest of the world to sell its goods produced by means of cheaper labor in our higherpriced markets and of necessity for the protection of our industry and our labor we must adopt a tariff plan to cope with that situation i realize full well that i am treading on somewhat sacred groundin that my partythe democratic partyis pledged to the theory of reciprocal trade agreements as a necessary function in expanding world trade i personally made no such commitments on the other hand i stated clearly my determination to defend the interests of my state and district should the demand for continued reciprocal agreements be made in the eightyfirst congress i shall not again be misled into supporting any legislation so obviously injurious to my constituents one major fault if i may make bold to suggest in our tariff making policy is that import duties are based on foreign costs of production and not on american on foreign standards of value not our standards our state and commerce departments and even our tariff commission compile their import data on the basis of import volume and not on a basis of import value this policy supplies valuable information insofar as statistics go but it affords no picture of the impact on our economy because it is not spelled out on a dollar and cents basis to avoid these sudden fluctuations in foreign money standards and exchange rates would necessitate rewriting all of our tariff schedulesa huge taskbut a task that some future congress could well undertake before speaking directly to the subject that brings me to the floor of the house i would like to browse around a bit and see how this panacea for all our economic ills is working in industries other than the pottery woodworking and handmade categories i was much impressed by testimony given this past week before the house committee on education and labor of which i have the honor to be a member by some of the souths outstanding textile producers who complained of competition from mexico chile and haiti where american capital was used during and since the war to build textile plants that are now exploiting the cheap labor of those nations and making and shipping into this country under the favorable terms of existing reciprocal trade agreements both finished and unfinished goods in one instance mens shirts were being imported but without collars and cuffs those necessary appendages were put on after they were past our customs a glance at paragraph 919 of the hawleysmoot act of 1930 will explain the device used to take advantage of our adjusted rates to comply with the terms of a reciprocal agreement with that particular country the operators of the sponge industry in florida are complaining of the mounting imports of sponges that are being reshipped under the marshall plan to germany and the united kingdom for polishing handmade china in the pottery plants here is one that should interest my colleagues from oklahoma and texas who are just recovering from the solar plexus blow caused by the recent drop of approximately 75 cents per barrel in the price of crude oil they can find the answer in recent commerce department reports on the importation of crude oil from venezuela and mexico already the impact of 600 000 barrels daily is being felt on the economy in the red river valley and on the osage plains where domestic production is greatly curtailed and in some instances suspended despite our economic cooperation administration program aimed primarily at rehabilitating warravaged western europe trade conditions remain unsettled already we have seen devaluation and repudiation of the value of money standards in these nations in other nations with which we have reciprocal relations we see total disregard for their treaty obligations in others we see import quotas imposed that put american industry at a disadvantage we cannot escape the observation that those charged directly with the administration of our reciprocal trade agreements act are lax in enforcement or totally disregard the rights of american commerce through means of the escape clause in existing agreements under our present tariff system there has grown up in this country mass production in many lines of industry whether this system is beneficial or not i am not discussing but it must be apparent that under this system with our present economic setup we will be impotent to provide necessary employment for all returned war veterans and other workers who will be out of employment when the coldwar emergency passes particularly will this be true if we sacrifice one american industry in an effort to give other nations buying power to enable them to purchase the exported products of some other american industry my native state of west virginia now the leading glassproducing state in the union and a large producer of pottery products and clothespins protests being made the guinea pig for such an experiment the present trade agreements do not limit the amounts of any given article that can be imported and in many cases we have observed that due to this fact we are uncertain regarding the quantity a foreign exporter of a given commodity will throw on our markets very often as little as 10 percent or less of an imported competitive article ruins the price structure of both the imported and the domestically produced equivalent article at present under the terms of the reciprocal trade agreements act of 1945 and as amended in 1948 we find deplorable conditions existing in the industries for which i plead lack of a backlog of orders or no orders at all has brought unemployment forced layoffs or resort to share the work plans in view of this situation i question the wisdom of the eightyfirst congress giving a free hand to either our state department or even to the tariff commission any further authority to negotiate probable reductions in tariff rates on the clothespin pottery or handmade glassware crude oil textiles shoes and many other industries of the natioa the situation as it affects the glassware and pottery production is further complicated by the actions of our military authorities in the occupied portions of germany and japan and by the marshall plan administrators in england and belgium where millions in american tax dollars have been expended in rebuilding and rehabilitating pottery and glass plants from which the flow of imports threatens to close our american factories every effort on my part to get the details as to how many such plants have been rehabilitated and the cost of such work has been met by army officials with the excuse sorry we do not have the details it occurs to me congress might well be interested in knowing these details as a prerequisite to a safe and sane tariff policy i have information the source of which i am not at liberty to disclose to show that eca has expended in england alone the sum of 1 250 000 in 1947 and 1948 for rehabilitation of pottery plants alone twelve million dollar program under way in italy how much of this is marshall fund money under the favored nations clause these occupied territories are accorded the same reciprocal treatment as is accorded the other 21 nations party to the geneva agreement in 1947 one of which nations is czechoslovakiabehind the iron curtainwhere good american dollars used in the purchase of glassware products are going to build up soviet russias economy when i pleaded with you in 1945 conditions were bad in both the pottery and glass industry only because of the fact the rest of the world was gripped by war were they able to operate producing ware for domestic consumption today their troubles are multiplied by the upward spiraling of foreign imports as other nations resume full production and must find a market in america for their surplus products"], [0.028312325477600098, 0.9716876745223999,

its accomplishments and to pledge my support to any measure that will insure its continued progress on a day long to be remembered by the farmers of this nation may 11 1935 the rural electrification administration was created by executive order of the late president roosevelt at that time only 1 out of every 10 farms in the nation had electricity and there was little chance that the others would ever get it unless the farm people themselves were given the opportunity to do something about it the rea program provided them that opportunity on a payasyougo basis today better than 85 percent of our farms are electrified in 1935 when this great program started only about three out of every hundred farms in north carolina had electric service now 15 years later 8 out of 10 are connected to the highlines the first rea loan in my state was made to the tidewater power co of wilmington back in 1935 since then 1 other commercial company 2 municipalities and 34 cooperatives have borrowed a total of 61 244 552 and the lines that this money financed now reach into all but 4 counties of north carolina in my eighth congressional district rural people in all 12 counties are receiving service from rea cooperatives more than 129 000 farm families and other rural establishments in north carolina have been brought electricity by reafinanced lines most of them would not have it now except for the rea loans almost 7 000 more familiesperhaps 28 000 peoplewill have service as soon as construction already approved is completed and the rea coops have pledged themselves to keep on expanding their facilities until practically all of the 45 000 farms still unserved in north carolina have access to power there are six of these coops serving the rural people in my district they are the pee dee electric membership corp of wadesboro the davidson electric membership corp of lexington the davie electric membership corp of mocksville the union electric membership corp of monroe the lumbee river electric corp of red springs and the central electric membership corp of sanford these cooperatives are doing a fine job and their members have great pride in their accomplishments altogether these coops are operating more than 8 000 miles of line and are serving nearly 30 000 of my constituents at least 500 more families in my district will receive electricity when these coops complete construction already approved by rea the money that these farm people in my district borrowed from rea to build their facilities is being paid back to the government at a remarkable rate the six coops have received loans totaling 12 655 000 and already they have made 20 5 xc xc x x c xe x e principal and interest payments totaling 1 290 458 including 162 901 on principal before it was due the rea program as it has been put to work by the farmers of my district and the nation provides an excellent example of free enterprise at work it is indicative of what a government alert to the needs of its people and its responsibility to serve them can and should do until the rea program was created more than 287 000 farm families in north carolina were denied the tools of modern living and farming they had little hope of ever having electricity and the conveniences it brings the conveniences which city people take for granted the things which we are so proud to lump together and call the american standard of living electricity has brought a new and more abundant way of life to the farms of america without electric power to lend a helping hand farming means backbreaking toil from morning until dark it means endless chores for the housewife doing the family laundry with an oldfashioned washboard carrying hundreds of pails of water a month that sort of existence was driving thousands of young folk off the farm to seek employment where they could enjoy the comforts of city living it is vital to the nation that those young men and women be encouraged to stay on the farm to grow the food and fiber needs of this country electricity coming to the farm has been the greatest single factor in offering them that encouragement this too has been a big factor in the migration of thousands of young war veterans to the rural areas of america where they have settled with their f amiles in farm homes which offer all the comforts to be found in city dwellings the wives now are able to enjoy electric refrigerators electric ranges washing machines and other laborsaving appliances but even of greater importance is the part electricity has played in helping the farmer to prosper it has increased his efficiency many times over what it was when all farm chores had to be done by hand now with the flick of a switch he can put electricity to work for him on more than 400 different chores it saves him time money and effort and increases his income in its role as a banker for the program which has been hailed by many as one of the most outstanding examples of democracy in action the rea has invested more than 2 100 000 000 in the electrification of rural america this money has been used to help start nearly 1 000 new privately owned privately operated taxpaying businesses run by the farmers of this country and dedicated to bringing electricity to every person in rural areas who wants it this goal is being reached at a record rate during 1949 reaflnanced cooperatives connected one consumer to their lines every 15 seconds of every working day right now they are operating more than 1 000 000 miles of lines and serving nearly 3 250 c00 consumers who otherwise might never have had electricity i would like to emphasize that the money borrowed to build these facilities is being paid back to the government with interest there is no grant or subsidy whatsoever connected with these loans every penny lent by rea must and will be paid back by the borrowers yet there are some who will tell you that this whole program is not american that through these loans the government is designing to get into the electricity business there is nothing further from the truth every pole every foot of wire every meter and every transformer that goes into an reafinanced electric system is ownedlock stock and barrelby the borrower rea does not own operate or control a single piece of electric equipment free private enterprise is actually flourishing under the rea program for example rea coops during the fiscal year ending june 30 1949 paid commercial power companies 30 924 331 for wholesale power to serve their farmerconsumers more than 237 000 of this was paid by the coops in my district more than 57 percent of all the power used by rea coops was purchased from these commercial companies this compares with 51 percent in 1945 55 percent in 1947 and 56 percent in 1948 rea coops are just about the best customers the private utilities have the commercial power companies are selling more energy than ever before in history and rea is one of the principal reasons the problem that faces rea today is serious with 85 percent of the nations farms electrified the rea program is being bogged down by a power shortage the almost fantastic increase in farm use of electricity in recent years has just about exhausted the capacity of existing suppliers to meet the power needs of the cooperatives in fact a recent survey shows that 22 percent of the coops do not now have enough power to meet their present needs another 26 percent report they do not have enough power in sight to meet their anticipated growth unless additional power sources are opened up continued progress of rural electrification is threatened rea can be forced against the wall unless power can be made available two reas have already been forced to sell i am pleased to know that the six rea cooperatives in my eighth congressional district are moving forward with renewed interest it behooves every member to work closely with his local rea board of directors and managers these men and women are performing a great service and must have the full cooperation of all users the farmers of my congressional district of my state and of the nation on this fifteenth anniversary

includes gentlemen on the republican side as well whose vote will not be absolutely vital in determining whether rent control is killed or whether we extend it no member can enjoy the luxury of a vote

my distinguished colleague from michigan has said the administration wants rent control to have a planned economy i disagree we have had rent control as a necessity because of the war because home construction was shut off for five or six long years while families accumulated and backed up in doubledup housing accommodations so we face a condition that you could not possibly in safety end when the war stopped we are not enacting rent control as a new policy in this country we are trying to get out of rent control as fast as we can without destroying the very basis of america itself that is the homes of america no we are not advocating a planned economy but i ask that you do not advocate planned chaos if you pass the amendment that will be offered to this bill from the republican side of this house today to kill rent control after 3 months you will get a planned chaotic condition in most of the metropolitan areas of this country i have heard a great deal from landlords and i feel very sorry for many many hundreds of them we have and have always tried to help adjust their genuine hardship cases less than a a thousand landlords appeared before this congress reciting their hardship cases but i know there are many more that should be adjusted i sympathize with the gentleman from kentucky and others who have received hardship cases but i know that all members on both sides of the aisle have been as alert as i have to try to correct and adjust them but gentlemen many hardship cases are bound to occur when you have 14 000 000 homes under rent control there is no solomon in the world who can make a decision that is going to please both the landlords and the tenants i have had a lot of complaints on these adjustments that have been made by rentcontrol administrators from the tenants as well as from the landlords in fact every citizen who rents a home in my own community of oklahoma city a city of 300 000 population had his rent raised 20 percent by the action of last years rent bill that action for wholesale as well as individual adjustments is still possible in this bill it is possiblenot impossibleto get hardship adjustments made or areawide adjustments to decontrol entire areas by local boards but it does not do congress any credit at all in a callous disregard of the problem to say we are sick and tired of rent control yes my distinguished friend and colleague from kansas on the republican side said he was sick and tired of rent control well i am sick and tired of rent control but i do not believe that earning 15 000 a year salary places me in the same need of rent control as the fellow who earns 1 500 or 2 500 a year we have heard a lot of complaints we have heard a lot of reasons why hardship adjustments were not being taken care of properly and this bill is designed to help correct that situation in the monthlong hearings this congress and this committee spent over this subject there was no real evidence that convinced me that anything had improved in the supply of housing to make possible decontrol or abolition of rent control in most areas of this country the best proof that killing rent control now is dangerous is furnished by the local boards a mechanism which the republican congress a year ago put into operation to try to give the very best possible determination by local citizens of the condition and need for continuing rent controls in that area these local boards have been in existence over a year now only 2 percent of the areas were recommended by these local citizen boards for decontrol yet the members on the republican side with 98 percent of the areas being found apparently by these local boards to be too dangerous to decontrol are now all going to be decontrolled by act of congress you can claim if you wish that your republican bill provides for a 3month extension it provides for killing rent control and make no mistake about it the only advantage that you get by this amendment that you are going to have in your motion to recommit on this 3 months extension is that the weather is going to be a little bit warmer in july when these people are moved out on the streets from the homes of america do not make any mistake eviction is one of the terrible fears of 14 030 000 people in this country it is very important i think not to unsettle this economy at this time i do not believe there is anything socialistic about continuing a war program until it is possible to get out of it safely and i do not believe there is anything unamerican about it i do believe that 14 000 000 people might be turned away from democracy and disappointed in their government itself if they are turned out on the streets without any protection here the 1st of april or even on the 1st of july these people cannot find homes almost half of our population must rent many of them are in lowincome groups earning less than 2 500 a year and there is no supply of housing available into which they can move when they get that dreaded eviction notice or a notice for an increase in rents that they cannot pay consider also the fact that the children of america of these people who must rent cannot find many places in which they can be admitted to live i am not going to queston the landlords right to prevent familles with children coming in i am stating that if you kill rent control if you take away the rights of families who now have children living under the protection of rent control and make it possible for their automatic eviction or the rents to be greatly increased i do not know where families with children can move you can read some of the very best publications in this country that have personally canvassed the situation on housing availability where families with children need housing and you cannot find that they can get into very many places the issue is rather simple it is not a question whether you like rent control or not i hate rent control i do not think it can be smoothly administered and i know there will always be some inequities in 14 000 000 rentcontrol operations as between the landlord and the tenant but i do not believe that the thousand or 2 000 cases that have been heard by our committee and the senate or letters perhaps numbering 10 000 or 15 000 that you and i heard from in these hardship cases means that rent control has failed if this congress turns tail and runs because of pressure from the landlords who have protested against the hardships they have felt we do not deserve the title of being members of the greatest legislative body in history i do know that with 14 000 000 renting there must be a lot of landlords and a lot of tenants who are willing to put up with the condition and not say it is unamerican and not say it is socialistic it is important for our economy that we do not do anything at this late hour when inflation has just about run its course to start another spiral of prices and wages chasing each other clear up to the ceiling then dropping and ultimately collapsing in a mammoth bust at stake in this issue is not the question of investment i think it is the question of protecting those 14 000 000 people in american homes who must of necessity rent these tenants are people they are human beings the same as the landlords from whom they rent these places and i think we have got to protect the human beings of this country both the landlords and the tenants"], [0.029982566833496094, 0.9700174331665039, 1, "the constitution of the united states takes no cognizance of parties and it is because of this that the present method of electing the president is not altogether satisfactory the constitution provides that the president shall be chosen by electors who are chosen by the various states it was the intention of the founding fathers that these electors should use their own discretion in picking a man however the electors are nominated on a straight party ticket and always vote for their partys candidatedixiecrat electors sometimes do not follow this custom it happens therefore that the presidential candidate in any state who gets more than onehalf of the popular vote or a plurality of the popular vote gets all of the electoral votes as a consequence it is possible for a man to become president even though he has less than a majority of the popular votes and even though he has less popular votes than his unsuccessful competitors in order to make this proposition clear let us assume there are three states each with 100 000 popular votes and each with 10 electoral votes let us further assume that there are just two candidates for the president whom we will call candidates a and b candidate a wins the first state by 50 001 votes and wins 10 electoral votes candidate b loses the first state receiving 49 999 popular votes but no electoral votes in the second state candidate a wins in the same fashion and candidate b loses in the same fashion in the third state candidate b wins the entire state by a clean 100 000 popular votes and acquires 10 electoral votes it is clear that candidate a wins the election with 100 002 popular votes and 20 electoral votes and candidate b loses the election with 199 998 popular votes and only 10 electoral votes in the history of the united states only two presidents hayes and harrison have won elections with less popular votes than their defeated opponents in all other elections the winning candidate has had a majority or a respectable plurality the lodge proposal aims to do away with the possibility of the president being elected by the minority or a small plurality of the popular votes by allotting electoral votes in each state in proportion to the popular votes thus in the state of pennsylvania the republicans in the last election would have received approximately 19 electoral votes the democrats approximately 16 and the progressives approximately 1 as you know what happened in the last election was that the republicans got all of the electoral votes in pennsylvania the lodge proposal provides that in case no candidate gets at least 40 percent of the electoral votes the election shall be determined by the house and senate seated together and voting as individuals not as states this is certainly a more democratic method than the present arrangement which provides that if no candidate gets a majority of the electoral college the house of representatives shall decide the issue by a majority vote with each state delegation having one vote the lodge proposal will effectively draw the political eyeteeth of all independent voters including the negro voter as far as presidential elections are concerned the political importance of independent voters exists in presidential gubernatorial and senatorial elections in these elections independent voters can swing the doubtful states into either one party column or the other in new york in the last presidential election the progressive party seceded from the democratic party and took enough votes to drop the state in the republican ranks since 1909 in everincreasing numbers the negro has been migrating out of the south to the large industrial states of the north where he has gone largely into heavy industry he has migrated to those states with a heavy industrial population and consequently large electoral votes it also happens that most of these states are doubtful states and pivotal states in presidential elections a shift of from 2 to 4 percent of the votes in any one of these states will carry it for the democratic or republican candidate it is possible to win a presidential election by carrying these large doubtful states it is for this reason that mr truman has been willing to stand up to the dixiecrats if the lodge proposal goes through the negro vote and the vote of other minority national and religious groups will no longer be important in the great pivotal states of new york new jersey pennsylvania ohio indiana michigan illinois california west virginia kentucky and tennessee instead of being able to throw these great states toone column or the other the negro will be effective in only approximately 15 electoral votesrough guess of course the same is true of most independent voters and voters of religious and national groups who are for the most part liberal and espouse the negro cause first it would appear that the lodge proposal has been brought forward because his following is convinced that the republican party is going to be a large mfnority party in the great pivotal industrial states mr lodge therefore hopes to pick up a proportionate share of the electoral votes in the big pivotal industrial states and to win by adding to these votes the electoral votes of the traditionally republican states in the north and the west secondly the democratic party is expected to be plagued by a large number of splinter groups such as the dixiecrat party the liberal party the labor party and so forth it is for this reason that this proposal requires only 40 percent of the electoral college for election tthe republican party can get 40 percent of the popular vote i thirdly the gossett proposal undoubtedly seeks to destroy the democratic party the democratic party has become a liberal party because of the influ ence of the big pivotal industrial states which have been falling into the democratic column as a result of this occurrence franklin roosevelt in 1936 was able to get rid of the twothirds rule for presidential nomination in the democratic party a purely southern requirement under the gossett proposal the electoral vote of the great northern states would be split but the solid south would continue to deliver a solid democratic vote it must follow that the southern democrats would again reestablish their power over the democratic party driving liberal and independent groups out of it no more fortuitous happening could be envisaged by conservative republicans the gossett proposal will result in a reduction of political influence for the north as a whole political representatives have had to pay attention to the needs of northern states and northern political economic religious and national groups because of the decisive effect of these groulj in causing the blocks of electoral votes in the large northern states to fall to one party or the other under the gossett proposal each party would get its proportionate share of northern votes consequently the competition for the northern states as a whole will be reduced but it should be remembered that the political influence of the south will still remain great since it will continue to vote solidly democratic the importance of the south will grow in the councils of the democratic party and in the nation as a whole for a long time persons concerned with politics have repjzied the essential danger of minority election inherent in the electoralcollege system but they have thought that the present system of electing the president is the only possible political counterbalance to the solid south a great many persons have admitted that the gossett amendment would have a bad effect on independent liberal and negro groups in the north as a whole and on the democratic party but these persons have felt that one cannot logically oppose more democracy in america it is assumed that the lodge proposal means more democracy first the senate of the united states represents each state equally the people of new york 13 000 000 have only 2 senators the people of delaware 230 000 have 2 senators under the present system of electing the president the influence of the people of new york and of its dependent groups is felt under the gossett proposal the influence of the people of new york would be reduced and there would be no counterbalance to the equal representation of the small states in the senate secondly we have a federal system of government and the gossett proposal fails to represent states in the election of the president while the electoral votes are to be apportioned in accordance with the popular vote in each state the real effect of the lodge proposal except for the loss of fractional popular votes in each state is to cast the united states as one great electoral district thirdly the gossett amendment provides that a man may be elected president with only 40 percent of the popular vote we consistently do much better than this under our present system it is hardly a democratic proposal lastly the only offset the negro has had to disfranchisement in the south and the southern filibuster has been his political influence in the northern pivotal states the gossett proposal will rob him of this political influence without enfranchising him in the south and without proposing to stop the unconstitutional filibuster the gossett proposal would have a bad effect in a cumulative fashion first of all it will kill directly the political influence of the negro and minoritygroup votes in pivotal states secondly it will reduce the importance of the northern states as a whole and the great industrial states specifically undoubtedly it is in the north where the negro and minority groups find most interest in their problems thirdly it will destroy the liberal democratic party for it will once again establish the power of the solid south over the democratic party in the last 20 years most of the advancement of the negro and other minority groups has come as a result of the interest of the liberal wing of the democratic party fourthly many independent groups liberal groups and even labor groups will begin to take less interest in the problems of the negro and other minorities as far as national politics are concerned political groups in america are formed by accretion the gossett proposal will have a disintegrative effect on the political groups with which the negro and other minorities have been allied fifthly the gossett proposal will kill the influence of the great urban pivotal states these states have had for the most part the most aggressive labor forces and have been the most powerful ones in presidential elections they have been the doubtful states where a swerve from 2 to 4 percent of the vote on the average has been enough to carry the state for one presidential candidate or another it is difficult to understand why the opposition to the gossett amendment in the senate came only from mdr taft and his followers and from a few democrats there are several possible explanations first it is possible that white house political leadership missed the significance of the whole move secondly it is possible that mr truman has been seriously hurt by splinter groups wallaceites in the north and dixiecrats in the south there is no question that mr truman is torn between dixiecrats on one side and negroes on the other it might be that he is willing to get rid of these splinters in his side even at the cost of a less liberal democratic party lastly there is evidently some feeling among labor groups that the gossett proposal will allow labor for the first time to lump together all of its votes in the north in presidential elections it is true that the gossett proposal is beneficial to all large minorities such as labor or the republican party however it seems to me that an immediate frontal political attack by labor will result in a general public reaction unfavorable to labor furthermore i doubt if labors influence under the gossett system will be any greater than its influence under the present system the indecisive nature of our federal separation of powers check and balance system of government would be increased by a multiparty system should the gossett amendment get past the house of representatives it has an excellent chance of being adopted by the states the southern democrats will vote for it as a block solid republican or near solid republican states will vote for it generally the rural states in america will vote for it since the effect of the proposal is to decrease the influence of the great urban states it is also obvious that a great deal of conflict exists now between urban and rural population over the question of the cost of food and the farm price support program the large urban states constitute only 12 of the nations 48 states of these 3 are normally republican constitution41 ratification requires the adoption of threefourths of the states the house of representatives alone represents population and largely urban population it is the best place then to fight the gossett amendment which must be adopted by the house by a twothirds vote i am not impressed with the traditional arguments that the dixiecrats are going to try to steal the presidency in 1952 by splitting up the electoral vote and throwing the election into the house of representatives the constitution requires that the president must be chosen by a clear majority of the electoral votes if no cantiidates gets this majority the matter is decided by the house of representatives with each state delegation having one vote if the dixiecrats bolt the democratic party in 1952 they can perhaps prevent any candidate from getting a majority of the electoral vote the election would then be thrown into the g{ouse of representatives voting as states the southern states would undoubtedly have more influence than if they had to rely on their electoral votes but they cannot elect a president in the house of representatives without the support of conservative republicans the constitution requires a majority vote in the house of representatives if the conservative republicans and the dixiecrats should agree on a president it would be the last election they would win for a long time exactly this kind of thing happened when the clay and john quincy adams forces ganged up to take the election away from jackson the popular reaction was tremendous the people took the attitude that the election had been stolen at the next election jackson was voted in overwhelmingly the american people cannot be tricked except now and then it seems to me that at most the dixiecrats can take only nine states in an election carried out in the house of representatives they will probably be able to take only three or four states what they really would like to have is the gossett proposal as they have shown by their vote in the senate their threat in a house election of the president i think is insignificant"], [0.030369281768798828, 0.9696307182312012, 1, "when and if

no answer or objection to my construction of it as a flat refusal to comply with the subpena am i to understand that there are members of this house who are unwilling to apply to this lobbying committee of its own congress and created by this house itself the benefit of a wellrecognized and longestablished presumption of law am i to understand that this congress will contravene its longestablished historical policy of giving its congressional committees the benefit of the doubt and the benefit of established presumptions in favor of its own committee i assert that i do not see how any member of this house can vote nay on this citation unless that member takes the position that it chooses to take as its choice an individual witness instead of giving its own constituted committee of seven members the benefit of legal presumption and the benefit of acting within the jurisdiction of the house resolution which created it certainly this man kamp did not overcome nor did he try to overcome the wellknown presumption of law in favor of congressional committees acting in accordance with their authority while on yesterday two of the minority members of the lobbyist committee voted against the citation to dr rumely you have not heard and i believe you will not hear them argue against the issuance of this citation against mr kamp that presumption is a presumption of law and i take it the congress is willing to recognize that presumption of law was present when this man kamp came before us as a witness and he did not overcome that presumption if any member of the house who is a lawyer speaks against this citation today i ask him if it is not a fact that the presumption of law was present in favor of the committee when we had the hearing at which mr kamp was present not only that but if it be the fact that any member of the house is going to vote against this citation on the grounds that the committee had no jurisdiction i ask that member of the house to show why we did not have jurisdiction i know you are aware of the fact that the record shows that this very day mr kamp is in the district jail a prisoner duly convicted by established and competent courts for contempt of a committee of congress in another case the anderson committee cited him he had his fair and just opportunity to prove that the committee was wrong the courts upheld the authority and actions of the anderson committee and mr kamp is in jail today for a proven contempt but certainly the interests of the american people as represented by this lobbying committee of this very congress is paramount to either sympathy or friendship for mr kamp in closing my extemporaneous word may i again briefly remind you of a few of the important points in this situation first under the lobby law passed in the seventyninth congress of which i was a member it is the duty of certain people performing certain acts known as lobbying to register mr kamp did not register he claimed he did not have to but under said public law and under the authority given and assignment made by this very house of representatives to this lobbying committee it is the duty and the obligation of this lobbying committee to check up and to ascertain what methods and means were used by mr kamp and his solely owned corporation to lobby members of congress i think i recall seeing copies of communications beginning as far back as 1944 to and from members of congress by mr kamp indicating that he mr kamp was lobbying and undertaking to influence directly and indirectly legislation but whether he was or not then or more recently the duty of the committee was to make an unbiased investigation to see what methods he was using and to see whether or not his methods resulted in undertaking to influence legislation directly or indirectly second your lobbying committee has not in any case undertaken to dictate control or otherwise influence what printed matter circulars telegrams or other methods were used to influence legislation directly or indirectly we certainly would not interfere with the freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment that assertion is not only unsound but it borders on a ridiculously erroneous statement for anyone saying that ought to at least give as much faith to the patriotism and desire to live within the constitution by other members of this house as such person himself claims to have in his own conscience third if any member of this house claims that this citation is not technically legal then why not resolve that legal question in favor of your own committee and let it go to court where mr kamp can have a justa fairtrial in court and let him prove that he is being illegally cited fourth by voting this citation we do not send mr kamp to jail he is not punished automatically he has his day ahead of him in court thats what he is entitled to i want him to have it so do you so do all of us thats the american way fifth your lobbying committee has studied and questioned and investigated many groups committees and organizations which have registered under the lobbying act and also some who have not registered as you well know but all of our investigations have been deliberately designed to investigate methods means and steps taken by these organizations and their representatives to directly or indirectly influence legislation we have not tried to trap or to catch or to convict any person or to prove a violation of law in order that such person might later be found guilty of violation of the lobbying act but naturally in the exhaustive study we have made there is no doubt but that material facts have come to light which may in the course of events lead to a further investigation of what they testify to under oath and to what steps they have previously taken or may in the future take sixth this congress depends upon the prompt vigorous efficient fair functioning of its committees including the special or select committees in fact the committees of this house are indispensable their adequate functioning a prerequisite to all legislation and their dignity an element which must be worthy of preserving and recognizing take away an efficient honest functioning of all committees of this house and you make the floor of the house of representatives impoverished and impotent seventh in the performance of its duties as a necessary arm of the house itself the lobbying committee has vigilantly fairly sought to ascertain both the amount of money spent by various groups in lobbying and the source from which it came and if you ask why the source should be investigated i say that the american people are entitled to know who pays the bills for whatever means or methods are used to lobby and thus to influence legislation directly or indirectly the american people are entitled to know who contributes donates and spends the millions of dollars annually which are admittedly used to influence legislation why should any honesttogod contributor of clean money hesitate to let the american people know that he is honestly spending money to influence legislation if someone is ashamed of their donation or contribution the american people should know why if he is afraid the american people will not judge him at face value if they know that he is spending money to influence legislation then he falsely appraises the judgment and findings of the american people when they know the facts and the truth why should any group think that it was fair or the american way to print hundreds of thousands or even millions of pamphlets of any sort designed to influence legislation and then be unwilling to have the source of the payment of the bill for that purpose secret or undiscoverable for gentlemen lobbying itself is not to be discredited nor condemned openfaced frank fair lobbying is i believe an actual benefit and i as one representative welcome the receipt of all ideas affecting any bill or proposed bill or legislation or problem facing our great nation and including its relationship to the world but i respectfully insist that not only i as a representative in congress should be able to ascertain and know who is paying the bill for whatever printed or published matter i receive through the mail or otherwise fcr or against a legislative matter but the american people should have a means of learning and knowing where the millions of dollars come from and where they go this is the only way the best interests of the american people can be protected from deliberate sabotage weakening disillusionment and even worse therefore my colleagues as long as some members of this house who are lawyers choose to stand on supertechnical grounds on this citation and to act as a court and a jury at the same timewhich they claim is their privilegei state that to me it is comparable to a situation in which if any member of this body was a judge presiding in a court and a defendant was arrested for speeding and brought before that member of congress who happened to be sitting as a judge and stated to the honorable judge that he the prisoner accused of speeding would not put up his bail money until the honorable judge proved that he the judge was sitting as the judge of a court which had legal jurisdiction to fix the bail which the alleged violator of law should have to deposit before he was released from jail and i say again that for this house to refuse to cite mr kamp and to thus justify his claim frankly and boldly and vigorously made your lobbying committee should first establish its right to ask him these questions it would be just as ridiculous as it would be for the court i referred to to adjourn the session of court merely because an alleged violator of law claimed in open court that the court would have to prove it was a court and acting in accordance with the law before he the prisoner would deposit the bail no my colleagues let us not give less than the utmost credence and good faith and dignity to our own committee let us give them the benefit of the presumption of law let us give them the benefit of the personal knowledge we have of their habitual integrity and industry let us apply to them at least the degree of good faith and conscience and impartiality in the performance of their duties as members of their committees as we choose to seek and respect for their own faith conscience and impartiality to do less than that is to create a situation where not only the lobbying committee becomes impotent but a condition the result of which should be applied to each and every other congressional committee with the result that individual witnesses will be duly and legally subpenaed by committees of congress will be determining the course of conduct of congressional committees by merely making the same ridiculous foolish unfounded claim made by this man kamp let us vote the citation
