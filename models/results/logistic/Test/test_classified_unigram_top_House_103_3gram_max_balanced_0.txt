of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes

trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as well as political leaders in 6 states and the federal district of mexico city because of the sweeping

our foreign relations departments and agencies i believe the legislation that is before the house has done this in a fashion that no other authorizing bill involving the state department and the other related foreign relations agencies has ever done before in this legislation we make direct and real cuts in diplomatic and counselor affairs in support services in foreign building accounts we reach into the bureaucracy we put forth for the first time ever caps on the number of people who willserve in the senior foreign service i so i say to my friend the gentleman from wisconsin and my colleague on the committee that this amendment raises the issue that the gentlewoman from maine and i have been focused on in our amendment we go further in the direction of the gentleman from wisconsins amendment our perfecting amendment adds nearly 200 million in cuts to the foreign relations operations we take additional money from the foreign building office accounts we reduce expenditures on entire national organizations we reduce some of the authorization in the peacekeeping area we have reached the point with the perfecting amendment where this years state department authorization bill is below last years appropriated level this authorizing bill is below last years appropriated level when you add to the fact that the foreign assistance act that we just passed was hundreds of millions of dollars below last years appropriated level i do not think anyone who is concerned about either the budget deficit or wasteful expenditures or expanding bureaucracies can say that these two measures that have been reported out of the foreign affairs committee have not done more than any legislation in the 11 years i have been here so i would urge the body to adopt whether they support the roth amendment or prefer the bermansnowepenny amendment the perfecting amendment that they vote on our amendment and continue this effort to reduce these expenditures and make this the substantial cuts that are con sistent with that i think they are more adaptable for the bureaucracy and more effective in a way than the stronger cut amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin and i thank the gentleman for raising the issue the cuts include 75 million in the contribubons to international organizations account which we had increased over the administration request to provide funding for unitedstates reentry into membership in the u n educational scientific and cultural organization this is currently the subject of an executive branch review the authorization would have paid for such membership if we had joined in the next 2 years rather than requiring reprogramming or transfer of funds from other accounts for such a purpose the deletion of this authorization does not suggest any diminution of supportfor any decision that the administration may make to rpjoin unesco it simply reflects a realistic assessment that the administration is unlikely to make a decision soon enough to merit fencing off scarce resources for such a purpose i remain convinced that we should rejoin and will cooperate in finding the resources for it all the reasons for our leaving have been remedied and while the organization may be imperfect it is no less so than other international organizations in which we continue membership or indeed than some of our own government agencies i have closely followed unescos recent progress staff of the international operations committee visited unesco in april for an exhaustive review of its operations and have concluded that unitedstates membership in the organization would significantly promote our foreign policy goals and contribute to our international economic competitiveness president clinton has received a petition signed by more than half the living unitedstates nobel laureates to this effect and all the major scientific and teachers organizations urging reentry the cuts also include a 25 million reduction per year in the administrations request for the unitedstates voluntary contribution to the united nations development program the bill as reported would have authorized the full amount requested for this purpose but would have withheld a portion corresponding to undps expenditures in burma until the organization withdrew from burma undps programs there are conducted in consultation with the slorc military

monstrous attack on human decency and on the lives of 7 to 10 million human beings in the ukraine 60 years ago it was a holocaust a decade before hitlers holocaust against the jews yet there was little reaction in the west to the tragic events that were going on the mammoth loss of life the monstrous loss of life that was going on in ukraine over a 2year time period we have seen that denial at that time and we also witnessed historically the decades of denial by the communists in our country and in other countries in the western democracies that this event ever happened at all one of those we should hold at fault not just the communist bosses in moscow who perpetrated this monstrous crime but also none other than i might add the chief moscow correspondent for the new york times at the time mr walter duranty vho played it down here he was an american citizen supposedly there to inform the american people in the western democracies of what was going onof the wholesale genocide by starvation that was taking placeand instead this incredible crime was downplayed by this journalist who then received as a reward for his great journalism the pulitzer prize after denying the people of the world the right to know of the monstrous crime that was taking place the crime that cost 5 to 10 million lives of innocent ukrainians this journalist yes he received the pulitzer prize for the excellence of his work and i believe it is time that the pulitzer prize committee insist that that prize be returned in our lifetime we have seen similar acts of silence on the part not only of journalists but of good and decent and democratic peoples in the western democracies to things the tragedies that perhaps do not have 7 to 10 million people dying but are equal tragedies the holocaust in cambodia for example we all knew what was taking place something was going on yet during the holocaust in cambodia which took millions of lives of the cambodian people there was relative silence in the american press there was relative silence here in the united states even as millions of people lost their lives the great cultural revolution that swept through china some people portrayed it as being a wonderful step forward and now we know that hundreds of thousands of people were losing their lives to this vicious ugly movement communist movement on the mainland of china this resolution

that virtually none of the cuts came from the remaining committees again i ask where are the big savings it is time for some truth in budgeting around here and it is time to really save the taxpayers money that is why i urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring h r 1428 which would require that all leftover money from the select committees be used for deficit reduction the committees are gone so now let us put our money where our mouth is"], [0.0010542869567871094, 0.4989457130432129, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me i rise in strong support of the religious freedom restoration act it is a good bill i urge my colleagues to support it today the house is considering the religious freedom restoration act this bill is intended to ensure that governmental regulations and laws do not unduly interfere with the freedom to practice ones choice of religion in this country for many years the supreme court evaluated governmental actions with respect to religious practices on the basis of whether the governmental entity had a compelling state interest in imposing on the religious practice unfortunately this strict standard was abandoned by the unitedstates supreme court in a 1990 decision for the past 3 years a large number of groups have worked together to respond to that decision their effdrts have resulted in a narrowly drawn bill being considered today which is intended to restore the standard of review in religious cases to that of a compelling interest this bill has wide support on a bipartisan basis there are now last minute claims that passage of this legislation would create a severe problem for prison officials in their ability to control and manage prison institutions if a compelling interest has to be established the opponents argue that they will never be able to justify control of certain religious practices this fear is unfounded as attorney general janet reno has noted in her letter to the chairman of the judiciary committee dated today prior to 1990 there was no significant problem experienced by prison systems in providing that a states correctional policy was justified under a compelling state interest under this legislation that same conclusion would prevail the applicable standard would still ensure that state and federal prison officials would be able to guarantee the safety and security of prisons while permitting the practice of religion as guaranteed under the unitedstates constitution"]]}
