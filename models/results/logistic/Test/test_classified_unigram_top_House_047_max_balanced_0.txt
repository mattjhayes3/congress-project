relihf that is desired for myself i have not waited for this bill to develop my earnest desire to wipe out the eutiro internalrevenue tax system i re artd it as the war tax of the country and it was the duty long ago of congress to have effaced it there is not now any necessity for one dollar of itternalrevenuo taxation the indirect tax upon imports even with a reduction of not less than fron 30 to 50 per cent of the present tariff duties with a revenue duty upon articles now free from duty will givethis country 250 000 000 annually not a tax in the tariff list need be raised in my judgment i believe that without raising any tariff duty 1 per cent but as i have said by reducing the tax on many articles provided all are subject to a revenue duty according to value the tariff on imports will yield more than 250 000 000 a year on another occasion i said to the honorable gentleman from pennsylvania what 1 now repeat that his wellearned reputation would have been greatly increased if he had effaced the entire internalrevenue taxation and relied altogether upon indirect taxes for the support of the government taking all the time necessary for a gradual reduction and reform of our revenue system in the few moments which i have left i do not choose to leave any doubt upon the mind of my honorable friend that i expected him to provide fully for the national debt for a liberal support of the government for pensions included not that immense mass of arrears of pensions amounting in the future to more than 300 000 000 for that was a proper subject for debt but the debt of the country whether for war or for pensions and an economical administration of the government can be amply provided for by revenue derived from indirect taxation i will vote for this bill because i am ready to vote for any bill that reduces internal taxation if i did not vote for the resolution to recommit it was because i could not face my constituency with a vote in favor of taking the tax off tobacco and refusing to take it off banks i am ready to take it off both and have so voted my constituency could never have excused me if ihad had so little intelligence as not to perceive that a reasonable

constitution contains the qualification that exclusive jurisdiction shall be exercised by congress only by the consent of the state i ask the gentlemen why the constitution is thus qualified if the federal government possesses the general power of eminent domain would not that power of eminent domain carry the right and power of jurisdiction wherever it existed i deny that the federal government

only was that so in regard to this property but it was so in regard to all oter property required for purposes of the government those purposes are specified in the constitution i will agree that where a state has refused to give to the federal government ground for the use of a postoffice the power of congress to carry out the delegated powers of the government would authorize it to condemne such property for a postoffice for a navyyard or for any purpose specified in the constitution but i deny that the power of congress over the suljectol commerce among the statel can carry the federal

be balanced against the 50 per cent of the expenses of the district of columbia which is required to be paid out of the revenue of the federal government this fact illustrates the manner in which we impose burdens on otherpeople which ought in nistice to be borne by the people here i have not time to refer to the acts of the fortyfifth congress but they will show to any person who will examine them that i am not mistaken in the statement i have made to the house on this subject and no one who will take the trouble to look into the matter can doubt that the object then in view was to impose a tax upon the people of time whole country and support this district at their expense while relieving the people here from their proper proportion of just taxation it was distinctly stated at the time of the passage of that act that the effect of it would be to gradually increase the value of real estate in this city and it did have that effect i objected to it then sir for the reason that there was more money distributed in this city than in any similar territory in the union and less reason therefore for taking the property or money of other people for the benefit of this people than for any other portion of the union but we were here in the midst of a most worthy people and human nature prompts men to be kind especially if we can be kind and generous at the expense of other people and when what we bestow does not come directly out of our own pockets but if we were taking that money out of our own pockets or from our own estates we would understand matters of this kind much better than when as inthis case we are attemptin gto take money from the estates or pockets of other people i feel as kindly to this people as i do to any other people in this country but it is unjust and iniquitous to charge the people of one portion of the counitry with the support of the people or the government of any other portion it is for this purpose sir that i have offered the amendment here which provides that onehalf of the expense of this work shall be charged to the cities of georgetown and washington i understand from the statement of the chairman of the committee who reports the bill and i think it is nferable from the report of the senate committee that the former work done in the erection of waterworks for this city was done at the exclusive expense of the federal treasury but that ithink does not justify us in going further and making an extension of these privileges to this district by the operation of the same principle and appropriate one and a half millions to accommodate tle increased population of this city i agree with what the gentleman from ohio has said this morning that we may expect this city to continue its growth and become eventually very much larger than it is now but why is it that the people of tme various states throughout this union and the territories if you please shall be taxed for the special benelit of those who happen to enjoy the privilege of living in this privileged city of washington what reason is there for it whatjustice is there ill it we have been taught that the policy of our government was that we should have no exclusive privileges for any no privileged class that a government which protected all alike by its laws which gives no special privileges and advantages to one citizen over another and which imposed no burdens upon one class that it failed to impose upon another had commanded the pride and admiration and support of the auterican people but when we step outside of this ue10 and begin to legislate for localities at the expense of other localities or for classes at the expense of other classes we are departing from all the traditions and principles of justice which underlie our american republican system of government we cannot too earnestly resist insidious encroachments upon public rights in this directioii we should meet them at the very threshold directly and assert ld

essestials of ilteir daily subsistence equal to both principal and interest of these bonds especially in view of the fact that not we but our survivors are to reap the benefit of tie drain upon our pockets the political ecouomyof this question involves too many subtleties to be discussed at length here but it may be stiicient only to sa that opinions as to the advisability of reducing the national debt to a mintely nominal point differ as widely as upon most other questions eta kindred chai acietr mid in view of this contrarety of opinion the abrogation of the tax upon alcohol tsed for manulceturing purposes could certainly not meet with o degree of oppositin freun the people which would make it a serious stop for congress to undertake even if the amount so withdrawn from the revenues were not raised by elso other method it is probable that the opposition to such a measure would and does come from a wholly different sourcoe namely the officeholding class who would see in the taking off of this tax a lasgo amount of patronage and political power removed from their grasp tle influence of this class with congress is too well known to be igisred anti can only be overcome by the strenuous efforts of the people themselves our represeiltatives must be made to understand that itis the general desire of the con tunity that they no longer bereqoired to pay n tax upon a domestic product which is fully as essential to their comfortable existence as the bread which they eat we are desirous of seing this proposed measure become a law and feel astired that the manufacturing tndustries we represent are in full sympathy with us in thie matter we therefore call upon all who feel an iterest to exert their influence with their respective representatives to secme its passage apowerftul movement in this direction may reasonably hope to overcome the efforts of the lobby which will certainly be put in active operation to defeat it let the friends of this proposed legislation now come to its support and such influenen as this journal is able to exert will be cheerfully accorded the enterprise there is one class of manufacturers as to whom this amendment will certainly be recogsized asj ustand necessary tobacco manufacturers require alcohol in order to make their tobacco pliable and they are really compelled to pay a doable tax they pay 1 80 on the alcohol and sixteen cents a pound upon the tobacco into which the alcohol is incorporated this is thereibre especially uunst to them but there is no argument in the present condition of our finances that can be offered against this amendment as applied to all industrial pursuits we have seen from mr rosshzsoys statement that while 33 per cent of the alcohol produced in this country was consumed in the
