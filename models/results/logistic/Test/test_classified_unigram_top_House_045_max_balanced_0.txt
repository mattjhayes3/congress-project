the bank must have a president and cashier which costs not less than 1 000 each which makes 2 000 00 amount of taxes and otherexpenses bank has to pay 6 320 00 clear profit of the bank after paying all expenses 6 967 50 now the man who loans his money without banking on it takes his bonds and sells them in the market for 8108 000in currency which is their present price this amount he loans at 10

that national banking is not as profitable as many suppose it is is on account of the amount of taxes they have to pay and the other expenses incident to carrying them on if it were not for the money that the banks make out of their deposits and the sale of drafts it would be better for every man who has money to loan to loan it without banking but the banks being located innearly every county are convenient to the people and therefore better for them than private shaving shops this calculation i have made is applicable to my own state illiana where 10 per cent is allowed to be charged sonic may say that the bank will charge more than 10 per cent so might the individual but under the law neither could charge more than that amount it is therefore seen that the national banking system when properly understood is no greater robbery of the people than the individual system of loaning money the great wrong in the whole system of loaning money is to allow either banks or individuals to loan money at a higher rate of interest than 6 per cent and when it is done it is a curse to the country as well as the people who borrow it the national banking systent does not increase the rate of interest on the people in any of the states the law only allows the banks to charge the rate of interest that is fixed by the law of the state and if the state has no law upon the subject of interest then the national banking law provides that the banks shall not charge to exceed 7 per cent the interest charged upon the greenbacks to all persons who wish to borrow money is just the same as the interest charged rpon banknotes so that the greenbacks in that respect are no cheaper than the banknotes our greenback friends insist that the greenback cutreoncy is cheaper than the nationalbank currency and that if we would break down the national banking system and issue greenbacks to supply the place of the nationalbank notes and the take the new greenbacks thus issued and purchase the bonds upon which the banks are banking we would then save tile interest on these bonds to the people instead of paying it to the banks there are two objections to this theory of finance each of which are fatal to it 1 congress has not the power under the constitution of the united states to authorize an issue of greenbacks and make them a legal tender in time of peace when the necessities of the government do not require such an issue in order to preserve the life of the nation in the decision of our supreme court reported in 12 wallace which is known as the legaltender decision this power of cungress to authorize the issue of greenbacks and make them a legaltender was folly discussed and decided by a full bench of nine judges four of them democrats and five republicans the democratic judges took the broad ground that congress had no power to issue greenbacks and make them a legal tender either in time of peace or in tine of war and that therefore our present greenbacks were unconstitutional money the five republican judges on the contrary snstained our present greenbacks and declared them constitutional money because they were issued in time of war when the necessities of the government were such that it could not exist without money to carry it on and there was in the judgment of congress no other mode of raising it thr by issuing our present greenbacks ard making thoe a legal tender the court in the majority decision in passing upon the question of the power of congress to legislate when the necessities of the country are such as to imperil the life of the nation and its powers 11 per cent above greenbacks what would be the result with the to legislate when no such emergency exists use this language 315 891 949 of new greenbacks we could have purchased and rethis brings us to the inquiry whether they wore that is the legal teifder acts tired 281 044 834 in 5 per cent government bonds when enacted appropriate intrumentlities for carrying into effect or executing any of the known powers of congress or of any department of the government the interest on these bonds at 5 per cent in gold plaily to this inquiry a consideration of the time when they were enacted and of would amount to 14 052 241 73 the circumstance9 in which the government then stood is important it is not to gold being worth 2j per cent more than greenbacks he denied that acts may he adapted to the exercieof laeftopowerand ppraprioe would make the per cent amount to 386 436 63 now if congress has the power at any time to issue greenbacks which makes the amount we would save

a consideration of the greenbacks which the people time when they were enacted and of the circanstances in which the would lose each year by the greengovernment then stood is important hack not being taxable at 1 9 if congress had the power at any time to issue greenbacks why per cent the rate of taxation did it become important for the court to consider the time when these throughout the states now paid acts were passed and inquire into the eireomstances which then sur would amount to 5 991 947 00 rounded the country it must be evident to every one that it was we would also lose the taxes which for the purpose of ascertaining whether the condition of the country the national banks pay to the was such as to create an emergency that would warrant congress in united states and to the states making the notes of the government a legal tender and compel the which is the same as paying it to people to accept them in the payment of debts if such an emer the people astheygetthe benefit gency did exist then the making of such notes a legal tender was a of it the taxe for 1876 paid by power that congress might exercise during that emergency but if the banks are not yet ascertained

nothing less he can judge about the same as the court then continues its decision and states fully and aceu 1875 then putting the taxes at rately the condition of the country at the tie these

question and will not now take the preservation of the national life what was it if not the legaltender enact the time to repeat what i then said but when the subject is fully meatsi examined into it will be found that the bankstock is created as is it not plain from the decision of the court to every person that taxable property by the simple act of subscribing it ot the stockis candid and unprejudiced that the court sustained the constitution books and when you destroy that stockby breaking downthe banks a lity of our present legaltender enactments on the ground that they you destroy that amount of taxable property to the country the were passed at a time when the necessities of the government were same as though an amount of wheat or corn equal in value to it had so great and so urgent that the life of the nation could not hive been been consumed in the flames preserved without the issue of the greenback and therefore con having shown conclusively by the figures that nationalbank notes gross had the right to pass these acts in order to preserve the govern are a cheaper currency for the people than greenbacks let its next mont if congress then has not the power to issue greenbacks in inquire which is the safest currency to them the greenbacks it time of peace when no such emergency exists because such an act is urged are as safe as money can be because the faith of the nation would be unconstitutional does not the whole greenback theory is pledged for their redemption that is true but the faith of the which is based upon a new issue of greenbacks fall to the ground nation is pledged for the redemption of the nationalbank note because it has no solid foundation upon which to rest being in plain precisely as it is pledged for the greenback so that on the question violation of the constitution of the united states according to the of security by the faith of the government the batiknote is as good decision of the supreme court in all respects as the greenback the nationalbank notes being 2 the next objection to the greenback theory is this it assumes redeemable in greenbacks or their equivalent are equally as valuable as true that if we should issue greenbacks to supply the place of the in every respect aid in some mere so as i will presently show nationalbank notes a thing that cannot be done as i have shown the great question of security in which the nationalbank notes in time of peace and then take the nn greenbacks thus issued and are superior to the greenbacks as a currency is this our greenbacks buy up the bonds upon which the banks are banking we would must be issued and paid out by the treasury department of the save the interest on these bonds instead of paying it to the banks government now if the secretary of the treasury should at any and thereby make a very large saving to the people if it were con time prove dishonest he could form a ring inside of the treasury stitotional to issue new greenbacks in time of peace and we should department and make an overissue of greenbacks to the amount of so issue them to supply the place of the nationalbank notes i am as many millions as he and his ring pleased in such an issue the satisfied that it would prove a loss to the people instead of a benefit ring would be the gainers and the people the losers adhere is where as the figures will clearly show the pledge of the faith of the government to redeem might hurt on the first day of this month october as the report of the comp especially when it came to redeeming an overissue troller of the currency will show when made there were then out there would be no trouble in making an overissue if the secretary standing 315 891 949 of nationalbank notes suppose that green were disposed to dose for greenbacks as we all know are money anti backs had then been issued to supply their place what would have ready for circulation as soon as they come from the printingpress been the first result produced the new greenbacks would at once they are all alike when struck from the same plates and dies therehave depreciated to eighty cents on the dollar and the bonds would fore there is no way of preventing an overissue if we have a dishonest have gone up to 125 that is 1 in our bonds woud have been official at the head of the treasury department if an overissue were worth fortyfive cents more in the market than 1 of the new green made to any very largo amount it would in the course of time be disbacks but suppose there hadbeen no depreciation and that the new covered and when it did become known the whole business interests greenbacks were worth as much as the old ones are now and that of the country would at once be paralyzed the panic of 1873 which our 5 per cent bonds were of the same value as now which is about brought so much distress upon the country would not amount to a drop in the bucket scarcely compared with the amount of bankruptcy and financial ruin that would be brought upon the country by such a calamity as an overissue of our money a financial system then like ours would be if composed entirely of greenbacks which would bang all the time by so slender a thread as the honesty of one man the secretary of the treasury of the united states and he above all other metihaving such an inducementhbefore him all the time to be dishonest is not the kind of financial system that a great country like ours should have it would be too much like living all the time over a powdermagazine that might at any time explode and blow the whole country into atoms if any one would be dishonest enough to apply the torch when he would be well paid for so doing in the case of nationalbank notes this overissue of money cannot occur by the dishonesty of our officials notwithstanding the nationalbank notes are issued by the treasury department for this reason when the nationalbank notes pass from the treasury department to the banks they are not money ready for circulation there are two blanks in each banknote and these blanks have to be filled by the bankofficers before they can be circulated one blank has to be filled by the president of the bank signing with his pen his own name in it and the other is filled in the same way by the cashier of the bank signing his name in it when thus signed the bankofficers and not the treasury department put them in circulation and the bankofficers are sure to see to it that no banknote of theirs sliall be put in circulation that is not all fight as the bank is compelled before the notes are issued to it by the treasury department to deposit with the secretary of the treasury bonds of the united states that are worth their face in gold as a security to the billholder of that bank for the redemption of every note that is issued and put in circulation byit with uationalbankmoney therefore asa currency the country and people are perfectly safe as the money is as sound as the government itself and as i have shown there cannot be an overissueof it as there might be of greenbacks these taxes which the national banks pay are heavy and oppressive and the banks will be here in force to ask congress to relieve them of a largo portion of them but the banks must remember that the people who borrow their money are burdened and oppressed by the high rates of interest that the banks as well as individuals charge for the use of their money while i believe in national banks and am satisfied that their notes are tht safest cheapest and best paper money in the world still i am unwill ig and mll not vote to relieve them of one cent of these taxes until their rate of interest is fixed at 6 per cent in every state in this union so that the people can borrow money at 6 per cent to usei business when that is done and a bill is now before this congress asking it i am ready to increase the circulation of national banks and give them 1 in circulation for every dollar of bonds deposited by them i would then be willing to relieve them of all national taxes except just enough to pay expenses so that they would be no cost to the people the taxes they pay to the states should remain as they are with our rate of interest fired at 6 per cent i have no hesitation in saying that nalionalbank money is the best cheapest and safest paper money that can possibly be devised for a free people in a great republic like ours and hence i will not vote to repeal national free banking"], [0.08968490362167358, 0.9103150963783264, 1, "i have but oneor twomore pointsto make before i forget it i desire to say that the

believing that the only sound currency any country can have is one which is introconvertible with coin i agree with him in desiring a resumption of specie payments in this country as early as it may be practicably accomplished b a u starting from these premises and beingwillingto admitthe ambignitywhich was containedin the law of 1875 which has been referred to and the repeal of the third section of which is before us i however draw the conclusion being a resninptionist in principle that it would be wiser to amend the law so as to reach the end we are aiming at rather than to repeal it entirely and thus remove from the 6tatutebook every pretense of an attempt or purpose at any time to resume specie payments lot us sir distinctly meet this issue i know very well the power of a minority to obstruct legislation or prerentthe affirmative enactment of any statute the question now before this house is shall we put it in the hands of a minority which we know to exist and who are not in favor of specie payments at any time or under any circumstances to prevent any law from being passed which shall ever accomplish that result it seems to me that is what we have to meet i offered sir on yesterda y an amendment which i thought would remove such objections as my friend has urged against the law of 1875 and which would embody those things i hich appeared to me essential if we intend to resume specie payments at all it is to that amendment that i desire particularly to call the attention of the house so that we may seewhetherthose of us whoagree inbelieving that we ought to resume at some time cannot agree upon a measure like this which will atleast ofler us a way out of ourdifliculty i will state in brief what it is and will not trouble the house to hear it read the third section of the act which it is now proposed to repeal consists of several clauses the first enlarges the bankingact so as to make freg banking the second clause of the section provides for the retiring of 80 per cent in volume of the legaltender notes for every increase ofircalation by the national banks i do mot propose in the amendment i offered to interfere with this first clause i leave the national banks as they are left by the original law of 18m75 but in place of the second clause f the section i would substitute a provision which i wilt refer to in a moment namely the canceling of legaltender notes in excess of 300 000 000 as rapidly as they are presented at the treasury of the united states and redeemed the quantity in excess of that amount is not large the gentleman from kansas told us yesterday that the amount in circulation is not more than from thirteen to fifteen millions in excess of e300 000 000 and consequently that portion of my amendment is of comparatively little moment the essential point is that we propose to keep the 300 000 000 of governmental currency now known as legaltenders in circulation we proposed also outside of that to have free banking under the nationalbank law to have both government currency and bank currency as being in aceord with what may be regarded the settled opinion of the country the amendment is in the nature of a compromise which proposes to limit the issue of legaltenders to 00 000 100 and then return by gradual approaches to specie payments it is by adopting this principle of beginning at thepoint whore we are today and going step by step making each month carry us over some portion of the distance to the point which we desire to reach that we are most likely to succeed we desire to increase the value of the paper dollar 1 per cent per annum until we bring its value up to the point that we all wish to attain nanely to par in coin the amendment proposes to begin on the 1st of january next by paying ninetyseven cents on the dollar for our treasury notes in coin and to proceed by adding a half cent every six months bringing them to par in coin by the ist of january 1881 i desire to present some reasons why this proposition should bo adopted i think we have hitherto found that in discussing the question of resumption of specie payments this question has troubled the public mind what assanuce have we that when the time fixed upon for the resumption of speciepayments comes the governmentwill be prepared to carry out and the national legislature will adhere to that policy the country asks whether after having declared that resumption shall take place at a given time but failed to provide any definite means of reaching the result it can be regarded certain that any earnest effort is intended the great political party represented on my left have brought it as one of the charges against the party to which i belong that wo havereally done nothing toward resumption that we have never accomplished anything in that direction now i am willing to admit that there is some weight in that objection in sd far as we have failed to provide definite and fixed steps toward the desired result and if there are gentlemen upon the other side of the house who really wish the government to resume specie payments i think they can meet me and those who believe with me upon the ground proposed in my amendment how shall we reach resumption not by saying that we will resume in 1879 or 1881 but by providing intermediate steps leading to that resalt and calculated to secure it when an outcry against contraction is made i think it has weight only so far as it is a protest against a forced contraction by the act of the government or by the national legislature the secretary of the treasury some years ago under authority of act of congress began to retire the legaltender currency and the result was a sense of pressure in the money market which was soon reflected here and resulted in a repeal of the authority for contraction why did it thus affect the money market simply because as is always the ease a contraction thus forced is like the process of lifting a weight by a screw it inust be done by the mere force of a pressure applied so as to bring the currency nearer to the value of coin than it would ordinarily come m1y mothod would be to redeem our currency at what it isnow worth in coin and by reducing the premium on the coin make it day by day month by month and year by year more valuable then you do not bring a pressure on the money market but the processhas rather the effect of easing it if the holder of currency can see thatthe government of the united states will make his treasury notes more valuable next year than they are this year by redeeming in coin at a less rate of premium such notes as may be presented his confidence inthe currency itself will he increased if at the same time this increase in value is so slow as to remove the temptation to hoard the legaltender notes their return to the treasury for redemption will oceuroly in case the quantityin circulation shall be found in fact larger than the business of the country will naturally and easily float this is no forced contraction it is applying the test of actual experiment to ascertain whether you have more paper curiency in the country than you can float at a given rate of premium on coin your steps in the process then should be far enough apart to give a test of this at each interval by letting the supply settle to the amount actually demanded we want simply to test whether the existing amount of currency will float or not and the only satisfa6tory method ioan conceive of is this of bringing it to the test of actual redemption as we go along of what use isit to inquire whether we have as much or less currency per capita than other nations when by such an eperisiestsm erucis we can demonstrate whether our supply is equalto or in excess of the demands of the business of the country therefre if onthe ist day of january 1878 we say we will redeem our national currency in coin at a rate of 3 per cent premium on the coin we thereby apply the direct test whether or not there be more plpercurrbncy in the country than the business of the country will float at that rate of premium who objects to this f we have constantly said that we did not want inflation and did not want forced contraction we want simply to apply the experiment naturally this is what i propose to do by this amendment and i think it will accomplish it it passed some may say why not go on more rapidly the reason is plain we must not proceed so rapidly that the mere increase in the value of paper by the promise of the government to make it worth more and more in coin will be n sufficient motive to board it if you make your paper appreciate in value 3 per cent per anuum inasmuch as during all the year past that was about the average rate at which call loans could be placed in wall street of course the people will say that this currency is just as good as any loan on securities which they could get consequently the notes might be hoarded we might find to our cost that at the end of our attempted resumption the currency which had been thus hoarded would be crowded upon us for redemption so fast as to exhaust allour hoarded coin and force a now suspension consequently it is indispensable in every such system that we should proceed so slowly as to test fairly at each step the question whether or not the quantity of currency in the country is in excess of the actual demands of trade and in that way only can we settle the question how much currency will stay afloat when therefore any gentleman complains to me that the national banks have been retiring their currency voluntarily my answer is that the men engaged in banking are supposed to be looking after their interests and when it is no longer profitable to loan money as the national banks loan it it only proves that there is too much currency in the country so much that it is no longer profitable as compared with other uses for money to put their government bonds into the form of nationalhanknote circulation and then to loan the circulation theremaybeanotherreason for contractionby thobanks butithink its force would be annulled by what i have already stated there mightbe a contraction on thepartof the national banks growing out of the fear that a very early resumption of specie payments on the part of the government would make it necessary for them to anticipate a rapid return of their own notes for redemption and it consequently might appear to cautious bank managers to be the part of prudence to reduce the amount of their circulation prior to the time fixed for resumption and to avoid the possibility of a run upon their banks as soon is coin payments may be begun this is one of the possible disturbances of the natural process of adapting the supply of currency to the demand which can only be removed as i think by making the approach to coin payments at par so slowly and by such definite and fixed steps as shall enable all intelligent business men to calculate with some confidence on the probable effect of the plan we may adopt and to takenway the feeling of timidity and uncertainty which might otherwise cause an unnecessary contraction of the banknote circulation if then our operations be so moderate and so slow that we can see step by step whether the currency we have will remain afloat it seems to me every sound objection against resumption will be removed our mouths will be stopped unless wetake the ground that we do not believe in a currency redeemable in specie at all these are the general principles i have attempted to embody in the amendment i have offered this plan will as i sincerely believe give us a safe resumption and if not a speedy one at least one which will be in accordance with the real interests of the country and of which neither the debtor nor the creditor class can complain i desire to say very little more on this subject we can as i think afford to say that we will in addition to the three hundred millions of treasurynote currency allow the national banks to be free we may safely allow them to issue as much currency as the country desires as much as the business interests of the country require thoso wants create the demand and the certainty of suppi ywill be determined simply by the profit which men will find in establishing new national banks if they have the capital on which to foun them i do not see why we may not go forward on a basis like this an approximation to specie at the rate of 1 per cent per annum is certainly slow enough to insure that the currency will not be hoarded for the increase of value and it will give a little more time than is now provided to adapt the business interests of the country to the condition of specie payments and to prove what may be the effect which isto followthe remonetization of silver thehistoryof thepast few years has shown that we need not fear a reckless inflation from free banking for the proverbial caution of capital has prevented any net increase of banknotes in view of theprobable retrai to coin payments within a comparatively short time the question will be asked why not resume on the 1st day of january p 79 as the law now provides i answer that i am inclined to yield as far as i have already indicated to the arguments which have been based upon the fact that in the plan we have followed hitherto there has been no actual test of the amount of paper money which could be kept in circulation in the presence of proffered coin redemption and that the practical solution of this problem would be worth the delay which my amendment contemplates i amtherefore disposed to yield so far to that argument as to say that we will take a little more time within which we will apply a proof of the kind i have spoken of and thus settle the question i do not propose to discuss at all the question of irredeemable paper money as against money convertible into coin i believe we are all agreed upon this that whether we ever resume specie payments or not and whether we have treasury notes in circulation or not the bulk of the ordinary currency of the country will be in paper all with whom i expect to act believe that this paper must be redeemable in coin and kept at the value of coin by suehredemption therefore it does not seem to me that it is worth our while to go into the discussion of paper currency which is not redeemable which nobody intends to redeema currency based upon any of the exploded theories of which the world has been fulla currency which should be merely token currency whether of paper or base metal or anything else i do not imagine that i could change the opinion of any gentleman who believes in such a currency therefore i frankly state my position as one of those who desire to see a return to specie payments by means of successive steps which are really calculated to bring it about then at the end we may come to the question which my friend and colleague has already stated then when the legaltender quality of the treasury note has served its purpose when we are actually back at redemption in coin we can take up this question of the war power of the government to issue legaltender notes at all and declare whether the constitution permits that the legaltender quality of this currency shall still remain in it in order that i may be perfectly frank here i will say that my own preference would be to declare now that when we have reached specie payments by the steps which i have indicated the legaltender quality of the notes should cease because i agree with my colleague that to give such legaltender quality is possible only under one of the war powers of the government the exercise of which should not be continued beyond what is necessary but we have meanwhile time within which we may thus seek to make an honest rational approach to the end we profess to desire within that period we may discuss the question i have just stated it seemed to me therefore that i might in deference to the views of some of my friends on this side of the house waive that discussion at present still i preferred to state my own position in order that there might be no doubt about my attitude in regard to any phase of the subject party lines no longer indicate the opinions of the people with regard to aquestion of currency there are gentlemen here on both sides of the house who are thoroughly honest and in earnest in desiring a return by proper means to specie payments within a reasonable period to all such i offer this amendment as a means of coming to an understanding there are those also who do not believe in such a return to specie payments at any time or in any manner and with these we must frankly differ cannot those of us who agree as to the object to be sought agree upon some method by which to attain it for one i am willing to abide by the result of a fair experiment as to the demand for currency insisting only that the experiment shall be upon conditions that may be a touchstone to insure the preservation and gradual increase jf the value of the circulating medium if under such conditions the amount of the currency should run up to five thousand millions absurd as the supposition seems to me i would have no objection to it the question is what we need and this question should be determined by something that is really a test not by the mere opinion of any theorist that twenty dollars or thirty dollars a head is the proper limit nor by any comparison with countries of the old world in saying this i am very far from wishing to be understood as contemning theory or despising the lessons of history few men have more faith in them i am only bringing into stronger relief my belief that actual present convertibility at all stages of the process of resumption may be made the demonstrative proof of the safe and proper quantity of our circulating medium and that consequently it is a mistake to resort to arguments from analogy or comparison when the simplerand indisputable test may be so easily applied a few more words and i have done i believe that one of the greatest evils that can ever happen to a country in its financial relations is a rapid fluctuation in the value of its currency and it does not matter whether the fluctuations are upward or downward what we need in my judgment is something that shall be as nearly as possible a stable continuous even value i believe we cannot get it in any other way than such as i have indicated consequently i also believe that we should regard it as one of the most solemn duties that can be imposed upon us as legislators to see to it that there shall not be created unnecessary fluctuations by anything we may do as we have now a currency worth wlthin 3 per cent of par in coin let us be exceedingly careful lest by letting down the bars by encouraging inflation without stint we cause vibrations which shall overturn all values i believe as i have said in proceeding cautiously by slow steps trying to keep what we have already gained and not after we have approached within a few feet of shore launching out again upon the deep stream consequently i look with great alarm upon proposition to announce to the world by an unconditional repeal of the act of 1875 that the united states has taken down all the bars against inflation that it shall now depend simply upon the caprice of congress whether there shall be a great addition to the national legaltender currency unchecked by any effective means of preserving its value under the present law your bankers are conservative because they are looking forward to the necessity within a few years of meeting n ovemme 7 their notes in coin but if yoa take off that safeguard if yon say to them you shall never resume or even that tou have no definite or abiding purpose of resuming yo directly and most powerfully encourage inlation it is therefore in the interest of steady progress toward an end which

postoffices and appealed to delegates and members representing the western countries not to press for the establishment or increase of service upon routes until the business on such lines shoqld be selfsustaining now sir we of the far west do not have our mails delivered to us five or six times a day in our homes and offices like our fellowcitizens in the great cities on the contrary the borderer is only too glad of an opportunity to ride from twenty to forty miles to a postoffice where a mail is delivered once a week from the hurricane deck of a mailriders mule ale do not expect the privileges which can only be afforded to thickly settled communities we recognize the fact that the mails must bear some proportions to the business transacted through them yet we may fairly contend for such a liberal extension of mail facilities as r are properly demanded by the settlement and growth of the country and which will be alike beneficial to the new communities and to the great cities which desire to extend their correspondence and trade to new points of enterprise in the latter respect we have equities that have not been shown forth in this debate from tables read today it appears that only in some half dozen states are the receipts of the postoffices in excess of the expenditures not only the territories hot the southern and western states are in deficit therefore gentlemen representing the few states named rest in the comfortable assurance that they are bearing the mail burdens of the whole country and say to the rest of us if yonr constituencies were like ours the service would be selfsustaining this is not entirely true by basing the business of postoffices on the receipts and stamps canceled an unfair showing is made against the west and in favor of the large cities in these chosen states are new york boston philadelphia all the large cities where newspapers magazines and books are printed and life and fire insurance offices located the seat of a large number of enterprises which have their offices in these cities but depend on the whole country for their business from these points letters circulars magazines papers hooks go to all parts of the country there is not a route anning into any of the territories or western states that does not carry in three times yes ten times the mail it carries out the stamps upon this mail matter are sold and canceled in the great cities but stamps sold and canceled in great cities do not represent the postal business of these cities only but they represent the business in that regard of the whole country the receipts at city offices no more represent exclusively the mail business of those citiesthan the receipts for customsdues at the pert of new york represent exclusively goods consumed in new york city but on the contrary represent goods consumed in every section of the country the southwestern states and the western territories andthe mining regions are to this government what the colonies of great britain are to her the springs and sources and tributaries which make up the great rivers of commerce and trade that flow to and from the great cities of the east as well might you claim that the mouth of the mississippi was the whole river ignoring its mountain sources and all its mighty tributaries as to claim that the mail business of the new york or the boston postoffice was the business of new york or boston alone there is not a mailroute in the western states or territories that new york and philadelphia boston chicago and saint louis have not a mutual interest in with the people living in those sections of the country i have rarely applied for increase of mail facilities in my territory without having received petitions from my constituents and also having received letters from new york chicago and saint louis merchants urging strenuously such inereabe as would give them more frequent communication with their correspondents tiails are quite as necessary for your merchants who wish to send out their circulars or their duebills as for ours to send orders or drafts for payment in reply the benefit of the mails is mutual sir the service in all that transmissouri region was recently relet and relet under the wise rules established by the last democratic house of representatives upon the amendments to former laws reported from the committee on the postoffice and postroads and carried through congress by messrs clark of missouri and mr waddell for the first time sir in my experience that service was let upon genuine bids straw bids were prevented from being put in and tnder the wise laws of last session and the rules and regulations enforced by the postmastergeneral and his assistant general brady there was for the first time since my attention has been directed to mail matters a fair and equitable letting of the new contracts some of these are taken so low that bidders must fail but responsible bonds have been secured the expenses of the mail service on star routes over the western country have been reduced over a million dollars they might perhaps be reduced still more were it not for the fact that thirdclass matter is carried on all those lines and the large merchants of new york a t stewart co and others come into competition with our local merchants and load down the stagecoaches with drygoods hardware and every other kind of merchandise until in many instances special service has to be provided for this kind of matter alone in this your merchants are really more interested than the people of that western country although it is a benefit to both but not exclusively to either one consequently you must consider this mail service as a whole to put the receipts of one office or one state or section against another will not do it is the business of the whole country that swells the receipts of the great cities without the country they would not do the business orshowthe returnstheydo the mail service must be considered as a whole corresponding with the network of traffic over the land and as a means of development of increasing intelligence and diffusing education over the whole country as the blood is carried from the heart to the extremities the gentleman in charge of the bill rmr blount who made such a fair able and conscientious speech to which the house listened with so much attention and benefit referred as it seemed to me n little unjustly to the increase made in the territories under the last appropriation for star service i have examined the figures since i heard his remarks upon them and 1 find that this increase was almost entirely caused first by the discovery of the gold at the black hills the going in there of a community of such numbers of people that congress is considering bills to give them a separate government a community which produces half a million dollars in gold per month where new mines are being 6pened new mills erected and a vast and active commerce creates such a mail business as would not be transacted by ten times the number of people in the settled and quiet communities of the east the next important item of increase charged to the territories was the exten sion and increase of mail service from texas to the pacific ocean across the path of the proposed great transcontinental railroad route which is an undertaking of national importance well now that increase could not be properly charged to the local wants of new mexico or arizona it was placing necessary mail service oil a great national route important to the people of the whole country and especially the people of the whole southern tier of states were interested in having that mailroute opened across the continent that rapid communication might be had and timely intelligence transmitted along a dangerous border threatened with invasion from mekican robbers and hostile indians and certainly the establishment of mail service to the black hills was necessary and ought not to be charged particularly to the people of wyoming they had no particularly overshadowing interest in it it was the senators and representatives of the people who had gone into that section from all parts of the country that called upon the postoffice department to open communication with their friends and had those new mailroutes opened as i have said a new community sprung up as if by magic large amounts of gold were being shipped out an immense business was being transacted great cities were striving for this business and great states interested in opening rival routes what could the

appropriated forpensions and the question of safety in its appropriation is an important item now it strikes me as the government owes this sacred debt and as it has a custodian of its funds supposed to be competent and honest it is safer that the payment of the debt should be made directly from the repository of the funds when duly set apart and appropriated to the payment in this connection my colleague on the committee the gentleman from pennsylvania has given us some figures he has shown where the agency system has proved a defaulter to the extent of nearly 300 000 in other words pension agents have proved defaulters and defrauded the people of the united states in about this sum i give it in round numbers at 300 000 it is a little less the gentleman from pennsylvania has given the precise figures in his speech and i think it very likely some of his political friends may have objected to his presenting them i 7io not know as to that but at any rate in a spirit of fairness and of justice and with a desire to do right that is commendable everywhere he has presented them and i am glad he has done so and that the duty did not devolve upon me now sir such defalcations cannot exist under the system here proposed on the point of safety therefore we find that the plan here suggested is infinitely superior to the present system why sir it holds to reason that when eighteen men in different parts of the country are chosen as pension agents many of them unfortunately selected to subserve partisan purposesi am making no charge upon the republican organization for it might be so if the other party were in powerit is presumable that so large a sum of money paid into the hands of these men is subjected at least to some risk all of which is obviated by leaving the money in the treasury until it is paid to the men to whom it is honestly and jastly due but objection is made that this proposed system will delay the payment of pensioners let us see how that is the commissioner of pensions who from all i have seen in the progress of this discussion seems to be taking a very lively interest against this billi make no special charges against him for as far as i know him personally i have thought much of him and think highly of him stillhimself in his letter maturely and deliberately prepared and sent to the secretary of the interior substantially states that delay in payments would not occur except in the beginning namely for the first quarter after the act takes effect when i made that point yesterday upon the gentleman from maine he went back somewhere behind the screen and brought in a card stating that the commissioner of pensions found it necessary to back out of that proposition now i do not care whether he backs out or backs in it holds to reason and to common sense that it is true how are your pensions paid now under the agency system how many men go to the pension agents and get their money not more than 10 per cent of them perhaps not more certainly than 10 per cent of them can do so in the great state of illinois with its population of over three millions of people and with only one office in the state and it located in its extreme northeast corner not more than 10 per cent can do it at the offices in the city of concord covering three or four states they simply cannot do it they do not do it they get their pensions by drafts through the mail how the vouchers are sent to them the affidavits are sworn to identification made and returned to the pension offices accompanying receipts and drafts for amounts are then sent through the mails to the pensioners what is the difference to people of my district and in fact to the people in every district in the state except perhaps in the city of chicago in getting a communication from the city of washington and one from chicago i think it is generally in favor of washington i would rely on getting a letter in the little town where i live from washington earlier than from chicago i am speaking now for the pensioners who do not live at chicago but who live all over the state and it is so throughout the whole country in all these pension districts they live miles and hundreds of miles away look at north carolina my friend living on the northern line of north carolina were he a pensioner would have to go to knoxville tennessee let me ask gentlemen whore would be the most convenient place for him to get his draft and transact the necessary business in relation to itwashington or knoxville i is it not washington every one knows it would be so that is the way pensioners axe distributed and the way pension agencies are distributed now sir i say it holds to reason it is common sense that there would be no more delay in the plan proposed than in the present system in the beginning in starting the system there may be some delay everybody of course knows such would be the case but it would only be for the first quarter four vouchers are sent to the pensioners on the first voucher there may be some delay but they have all these papers prepared so that on the incoming payment they are ready to transmit the drafts at once and there is no reason why
