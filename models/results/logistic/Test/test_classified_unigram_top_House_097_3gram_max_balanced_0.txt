economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9690415263175964, 0.9690415263175964, 0, "i am proud to express my wholehearted support for the adoption of house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the

disease than any other group of diseases in the country in recent years we are on the verge of really nailing down a good bit of information which is just starting to come through because of the years of emphasis in those areas we are told we should drop 34 million from that item in vocational rehabilitation they are suggesting for the state grant program that we have a 34 million reduction in that

upper midwest today it is continuing on to the eastern part of the countryr tonight last year we were at 1 85 billion for that the house cut it by 50 million the senate has come in 216 million under

elderly in head start the president made a grand announcement that he was asking for 950 million this year the senate is suggesting that we cut that to 912 million that means because of the cost increases and recommended cuts in those programs we will lose 15 000 head start kids take older workers programs like green thumb and senior aid we debated a lot on this floor today about programs

estimate that is the estimate of the department of labor in a document which they now have which they have refused to release to the house and which i will be asking the appropriations committee to

added what i call a frontend discharge procedure for disapproval resolutions in the first house to act under myoriginal bill no special discharge procedure was provided if a committee did not report a disapprovai resolution within a specified period as the levitas bill would provide however a discharge motion would be in order in the second house to act if a committee has not reported the resolution within 15 days after its referral from the first house and if that motion is supported by onefifth of the membership of the house involved under my new discharge proposal if onefifth of the members of the house involved sponsor or cosponsor an appropriate disapproval resolution h 7746 within 25 days after submission of the regulation a committee would be required to announce and undertake a review of the rule and report a disapproval resolution with its recomendations not later than 45 days after submission of the rule if it does not report within 45 days the committee would automatically be discharged of the first such resolution referred to it this special discharge procedure however would not apply to concurrent resolutions for exeutive agency regulations since such resolutions must be accompanied by a committee finding that the rule is contrary to law or congressional intent in the second house to act discharge would be automatic 15 days after referral of the resolution if a committee has not reported it seems to me this discharge mechanism is best designed to both permit a committee time to review and report on a regulation about which there is substantial interst while at the same time insuring that a disapproval resolution cannot be bottled up in a committee when there is substantial objection te it but the important thing it seems to me is that the house involved have the benefit of a committee report on any regulation proposed to be disapproved so that we can act in an informed manner a committee could also obviously undertake a review of a rule on its own initiative but if it formally announces such a review to the speaker and in days after submission of the rule it would again be required to report a resolution of disapproval and it would be automatically discharged of such a resolution if it did not report within 45 days after submission of the rule finally i have eliminated the provision of h r 3740 which would have tied agency review of major existing rules every 10 years with the ability of either house to adopt a resolution for reconsideration of any other existing ruleboth of which would have forced an agency to repromulgate the existing rule and thus subject it to possible disapproval by joint resolution under my revised bill the joint resolution disapproval mechanism would only apply to those existing rules which congress forces an agency to repromulgate any existing rule which an agency decides to modify or repeal on its own initiative would be treated as a new rule under the disapproval mechanisms which apply to new rules mr speaker i think this revised bill does meet the administration halfway while doing the same with respect to the levitas bill i expect this issue will come to the house in the form of an amendment to whatever regulatory reform hill is finally reported from the house judiciary committee it is important that this be viewed as one component in an overall regulatory reform strategy and not as a panacea for our regulatory problems but i do think it is important that congress reclaim its prerogatives over the legislative powers we have delegated to agencies through the rulemaking proccss as elected representatives of the people we should be held ultimately accountable for the laws we pass including the regulations issued to carry them out at this point in the record i include a brief summary of my revised regulatory control act h r 4838bnixi summary of revised regulatory control acr by hox trent lott 1 coverage the congressional review procedures would apply to all proposed and existing rules of general applicability with exceptions specified 2 submissions and referral proposed final rules would be submitted to congress oil the same say as publication in the federal register and would be referred to one committee in each house having jurisdic tion over the statute or agency under which the rule in promulgated 3 time limihts no rule could become effective for 60days of continuous session of congress after submitted and the review period would be extended to 90days if either house adopts an appropriate resolution of disapproval within the 00days period a rle could become effective sooner if no committee announces its intention to review the rule within 30days after its submission or if either house rejects an appropriate resolution of disapproval 4 foyns of disc ppoval an appropriate resolution of disapproval would be a a concurrent resolution for any proposed executive agency rule which a committee determines is contrary to law or congressional intent b a joint resolution for any executive agency rule which a committee determines should be disapproved for any other reason c a concurrent resolution for any proposed independent regulatory agency rule which a committee determines should be disapproved and d a joint resolution for any existing rule which is repromulgated pursuant to the adoption by either house of a resolution for reconsideration a rule could not become effective if an appropriate resolution is adopted by both houses or enacted as the case may be within the specified time period 5 special discharge proedures if onefifth of the membership of the house involved sponsors or cosponsors an appropriate resolution with respect to a proposed rule within 25days after its submission a committee would be required to review the rule and report the resolution within 45days after the rules submission except this special discharge procedure would not apply to concurrent resolutions disapproving executive agency rules discharge would be automatic if a committee has not reported after 45days in the second houlse to act discharge would be automatic if a committee has not reported the resolution adopted by the first house within 15days after its referral if a ccummittce determines to review a rule on its own initiative and so announces to the speaker and in the congressional record within 28days after submission of the rule it would be required to report an appropriate resolution within 45days after the rules submission and would be discharged if it does not 6 floor consideiatlon once an appropriate resolution is reported or discharged it would be highly privileged subject to twohours of debate divided between proponents and opponents and not subject to amendment or a motion to recommit 7 reconsideration of existing rulcs either house may adopt a simple resolution for reconsideration of any existing rule in effect for at least two years if such resolution is properly reported from committee with respect to any rule for which a resolution for reconsideration has been adopted and agency would be required to review the rule and either renew modify or repeal it any such action would be subject to the congressional review process of the act and possible disapproval by enactment of a joint resolution 8 court appeal all proposed executive as opposed to independent agency rules which are disapproved by adoption of a concurrent resolution can he put into effect if an agency appeals the action in the federal district court for the district of columbia and the court finds the rule is consistent with the statute and the agency has no alternative means of implementing or enforcing the statute 9 miscellaneous an agency may not promulgate a new rule substantially the same as a rule which hits been disapproved but may incorporate thle relevant portions of the rulemaking record for the disapproved rule into that for the new rule disapproval of a rule shall not relieve agencies from responsibility to adopt a rule but time limits would begin again from date of disapproval congressional inaction or rejection of a disapproval resolution shall not be deemed approval for judicial review purposes invalidation of any portion of the act shall not invalidate the remainder of thle act the new rulemaking review procedures shall supersede existing ones the act shall take effect at the beginning of the 98th congress and expire at the end of the 100th congress any rulemaking review procedures shall resume their effectiveness if

revocation proceeding it is the current practice of the agency to allow violator to opt for a fine when the violations are not considered to be serious enough to warrant a revocation proceeding this amendment conforms the law to current agency practice second the bill would also require a foreign claimant or the assignee of a nonresident to post a mandatory bond under the paca this would close a loophole in the current law which permits a nonresident to avoid the bonding requirements by assigning claims to unitedstates residents this bill would make it mandatory that all nonresidents and
