appropriations for this civilservice commission was because the state of kentucky had not got her proportionate part of the patronage i think after the remarks i made in the opening of this discussion to show that there were only three hundred and seventytwo who had been appointed under this civilservice commission by examinations all of whom were males except eight and that outside of the civilservice commission there had been four hundred and ninetyfour appointed by the president and heads of departments many of whom have taken prominent part in the political campaign which is now going on before this countrywhen the gentleman remembers the remarks i made on this floor this afternoon and then says that was the only reason i could give i simply reply that such a remark is unworthy any man except one who could sit in the committee on ways and means and join in a unanimous report of an unlimited bonded period as he did in the fortyseventh congress and then go to iowa and preside over a temperance meeting a republican prohibition convention i say sir that when he makes that remark he makes it knowing that when this civilservice bill was passed two years ago it was a part of the same diplomacy which enabled him to perform antics in one of the committeerooms in this deliberative body and then perform statesmanship in the state of iowa now i want to call attention to the exception in rule xix rul xix there are excepted from examination the following 1 the confidential clerk or secretary of any head of a department or office 2 cashiers of collectors 3 cashiers of postmasters 4 superintendents of moneyorder divisions in postoffices 5 the direct custodians of money for whose fidelity another officer is under official bond but these exceptions shall not extend to any official below the grade of assistant cashier or teller 6 persons employed exclusively in the secret service of the government or as translators or interpreters or stenographers 7 persons whose employment is exclusively professional 8 chief clerks deputy collectors and superintendents or chiefs of divisions or bureaus but no person so excepted shall be either transferred appointed or promoted unless to some exceuted place without an examination under the commission promotions may be made without examination in offices where examinations for promotion are not now held until rules on the subject shall be promulgated there are eight classes of exceptions to the civilservice ex4mination i remember the old latin phrase excptio probat regulam but here is a case of four hundred and ninetyfour exceptions and only three hundred and seventytwo under the rule the four hundred and ninetyfour exceptions are salaried officers above 1 800 political bosses like the commissioner of internal revenue the paid agents prowling over the country beating up recruits for the chicago convention but three hundred and seventytwo under your civilservice commission were little clerks from 1 800 down possibly including women who scrub the floors in the department c now i want to call your attention to a letter i have received on this subject"], [0.016223246231675148, 0.016223246231675148,

subordinate officer in obeying orders general grants letter which makes up a large part of the brains in the report of the majority of the military committee for the author of the report must have supposed he belonged to that same three hoandred characterized by him the other day as knownothingsgeneral grantt letter i repeat says it is never true that a subordinate has a right to excraise discretion on the subject of obeying his superior officers order if a battle is raging now we will soon see whether there was not a battle raging a discretion is only exercised when the conditions under which the order was issued are changed and when the changed condition coum jot have been known to the officer giving it the discretion of an officer relates to means not ends it relates to his doing more than his order requires not less he is to interpret his order when a battle is raging to do everything within his power with all his command the soldiers mission is to fight war is without affection it meansdevastation destruction death it never justifies a subordinate officer i so interpreting an order as not to require him to go into battle with his command on account of his own personal safety or that of his troops i need not in this presence discuss the question of discretion on the subject of obeying an order almost onehalf if not quite onehalf of the members of this house have been officers or soldiers on one side or the other in the most memorable sanguinary and destructive of all modern wars and to either side may i confidently appeal to support the point i make that it is never the duty of an officer to retreat in the presence of an enemy when any of his fellowsoldiers are in the conflict the military authorities lay down the only safe and wise rule de hart in his admirable work has collected the experience and judgment of all the ages in the rule he lays down when he says hesitancy in the execution of n military order is clearly under any circumstances a serious offense and would sulbject one to a severe penalty but actual disobedience is a crime which the law has stigmatized as othe highest degree and against which is denounced the severe penalty of death now did porter disobey orders i will spend but a little time for i have not much to spare on this subject it is admitted and i have tried to keep on undisputed groundit is admitted that general porter received an order prior to 1 oclock on the morning of the 28th of august when he was at warrenton junction ordering him to move at 1 oclock a in to bristoe station and which order commanded him to reach there by daylight nobody disputes that he was nine miles away from bristoe station he called his officers about him and showed the order to them late at night not 1 oclock at night but he told them there was something to sleep on not to execute but to sleep on one oclock came and hehad not moved it is said that the head of his column moved at 3 oclock and he executed that great march of nine miles with his command reaching bristoe station after 10 oclock next day he could have marched it reaching there at the time lie did after 7 oclock in the morning and not marched more than three miles an hour two and a half miles an hour is ordinary and easy marching including rests for large bodies of troops i take nobodys testimony on that question i stand here in the presence of a score and more of men who know the road from warrenton junction to bristoe station who as well as myself at different times have marched over it by night and by day with infantry troops in nmuch less than three hours they say the road was blocked that night by wagons instead of being a narrow gorge or defile and being difficult to go through it was a double road one either side of the railroad and on each side fbr a lull mile you could march a command with artillery anywhere you pleased on that summer night troops could better march outside of the road than in the dust in it then he disobeyed that order but we are told it made no difference because pope was mistaken and no battle was fought at daylight in the morning and porter fbr this reason was justified in disobeying it now that is not an excuse for disobeying an order to be given by any officer or which should be considered for a moment a single deserter from the army might be arrested and taken back and when tried truthfully say why i deserted but before you arrested me and while i was absent there was no fighting for me to do now do not shoot me for that act for i have done no harm in trying to escape and i am now here it is said it was too dark to march troops before the break of day on the morning of the 28th of august it lid not rain and there could have been no extraordinary darkness longstret could easily march his coniaderate troops all night and the brave faithful general ricketts who fbund himself with his division at thoroughfare gap between longstreets and jacksons corps marched all night to extricate his soldiers and be ready in the early morning to obey his commanding generals orders to engage in the fight but it was porters duty to be where his commanding general apprehended danger that sort of an excuse is not one that should come ever from anybody let alone from a trained soldier i do not stop to read the testimony in this connection to prove that he disobeyed the joint order to mcdowell and himself to move to the field of battle early on the morning of the 29th i do not care enough about it i do not think that a soldier fit to command a corps in the armies of the united states needs to have an express order to move to the battlefield when the thunder of cannon was sounding in his ears general porter also excuses himself because he says in one of his petitions i believe he gave a double construction to that order the double construction which he gave was always such that he had one alternative not to go into the fight and that is the alternative he always adopted but he was commanded by that order to move to the battlefield and he did move in that direction but as he approached it and found the enemy stuarts cavalry dragging brush in sight lie did not proceed to attack or reconnoiter but he veered off from the proper field retreated toward manassas and settled himself down like a christian gentleman i suppose under the caves of bethlehem church he said he could not obey the order delivered to him dated 4 30 p m on the afternoon of the 29th because it was received too late but on his own statement it was still not too late to have gone into the engagement for he pretends to have attempted the execution of the order but give him even to the hour of 6 oclock which is after the time the order was received we find by the official report of union officers and confederate officers from commanding generals down that they were able to fight until 9 oclock that night within easy hearing of the cars of general porter then he had three hours in which he could have gone to the relief of his comrades already at death grips in that bloody conflict i will not stop to weigh that testimony but give you another circumstance which is to my mind most significant general sykes loyal to general porter then was willing to swear and did swear belbre the court that when the 4 30 p us order was delivered to porter he concealed its contents and although he spent that evening and all the coming night with him he never learned that porter had that order to go into battle although hewas a division commander and waiting to receive orders from him nay he did not tell his officer next in rank to him that he was ordered to move his whole corps into the battle sykes did not hear of the order until the next day it is true that porter after receiving and concealing the order dispatched morell whose division was in front ofsykess directing him to take four regiments and deploy skirmishers in there and make an attack looking out memwbile well for his rear and that is all that we learn of the attempt made by him to comply with this order some officer had reported to morell that the enemy were advancing and said they seemed tobein great force a whole brigade was the language used that report went to porter at almost the very moment he received the 4 30 p in order to go into the battle hie thus had notice from morell that there was a whole brigade advancing in his front but he sent out four regiments and had them soon after withdrawn and now his friends claim that lie did the best be could to execute the order but porter is excused by the board and by others they claim that if he had gone into the battle at that time he would have encountered a superior ibrce and met with a disaster i do not shrink from wrestling with this question also for it is capable of complete and perfect demonstration that such is not the case but what if it had been suppose it to be true suppose as a matter of fact that porter had longstreets whole corps before him le did not know it some of these men pretend to say that he knew more than anybody else knew in reference to the matter but morell who was in front did not so report and there is that grand gallant soldier col b f smith gone to his long account years ago who says that during the whole of that day he was all the time on the advance line and so swears in the testimony before the qourtmartial that he was all day sending the latest news as to the presence and force of the enemy and lie was not able to discover a considerable force before them and yet it was through smith that porter got his information porter did not know longstreet was before him if it was true that he was there bdit was it true that there was an overwhelming force in his front"], [0.02601778507232666,

reported this bill provision has been made by the federal government for acquiring and supplying information in regard to agriculture education mining commerce and transportation but notwithstanding more than 10 000 000 of our citizens onefifth of our entire population are engaged in manual labor earning their subsistence from daily wages no means have been provided by this government for obtaining and supplying information that will serve to protect and give greater prosperity to this numerous and worthy class of citizens the bill is free from the objections that obtain to many bills of this character it does not seek to create an office and clothe its incumbent with extraordinary powers nor does it incur any great expense upon the part of the government the salary of the commissionerisfixed at 4 000 per year and no competent man can be obtained for a less sum the commissioner can only expend 25 000 per year in obtaining the inlbrmnation for which the department is formed and this is a mere bagatelle in comparison with the amount of taxable wealth annually produced by mechanical labor and the amount is insignificant in comparison with the good it will accomplish we have had much legislation in behalf of capital for the protection and advancement of what is termed the business interests of the country by which is meant not the interests of the workingmen of this country but the interests of the few who own and control capital i have no prejudice against capital i believe it is right to encourage and protect the investments of capital we have been doing it for years not only here but in all the state governments and we have done but little or nothing for labor i know the theory is that the protection of capital is the protection of labor that as capital must furnish employment to labor whatever gives encouragement and protection to the one also advances the interests of the other this is partially true but the sad lessons taught by experience are that it is not altogether so and that it is true only to a limited extent capital is selfish exacting and not unfrequently oppressive the caipitalist is perfectly willing to have the laborer work for him ten and nore hours out of the twentyfour for such an amount of money as will be barely sufficient to support himself and family and yet the man of wealth sees no harm in this but feels that he has done well in furnishing employment to the laborer at any price he regards labor as acommodity to be purchased at the cheapest possible price ile does not hesitate to import labor contracted for in europe or elsewhere in order to reduce wages and to increase his own profits the results of such action upon the part of capitalists have been strikes and their consequences more frequently disastrous to the laboring man and those dependent upon him than to any one else a gentleman near me asks how i am going to help it i answer that i want such infbrmation obtained upon the subject of labor as will enable not only this government where it has jurisdiction but also the state governments to act advisedly upon this subject and i will say to the gentleman who interrogated me that there can be no more objection to the department sought to be created by this bill than there is to the agricultural department not one bit there can be no greater objection to it than to other bureaus of statistics which have been established by this government it is high time there should be some legislation in behalf of the workers of this country in behalf of those whose brain and muscle have contributed so much to the development of this great country if it be right to obtain and supply information to those who are engaged in commerce and the carrying business why should we not do the same for those without whose help it would be impossible to operate railroads and to carry on commerce this bill if it becomes a law will be the means of bringing capital and labor together in more friendly relations than they have been heretofore of forming a closer alliance for i have no doubt but what the information obtained and disseminated will bring about such investigations and cause such arrangemeats to be made as will cause greater harmony between capital and labor and be of mutual advantage to these great elements in society this house is now wrestling with a great financial question the tariff protectionists claim that a high tariff increases wages or hire of the workingmen their slogan is protection for american industry for american labor freetraders and tariff reformers deny that a high tariff is of benefit to the mechanic or laboring man they claim that it only increases the profits of the capitalist who has his money invested in manufactures without a corresponding increase of the wages of the operatives or employ6s and that it is a positive injury to the workman because of the increased price it causes him to pay for everything that he buys for himself or family now if we had had forthelast ten years a bureau of labor statistics what a flood of light it could throw upon this subject this is one of the questions that i want investigated i am a tariff reformer as much so as any man on this floor and i am so sure that truth is on my side of this question that instead of being afraid i absolutely court an investigation of it i am willing to know the truth about it if my party can not be sustained by the truth then i for one say it ought not to be sustained i know that reports from government departments and bureaus are not entirely reliable and especially is this so in regard to statistical information that too frequently such reports bear the impress of the politics of the administration under which they are made but this is an incident of humanity and there is no help for it i suppose the same fault can be imputed to every department of the government yet with all its imperfections the department provided for by this bill can and will do much for the good of the toiler who in the sweat of his face must cat his bread ifthe commissioner performs the specific duties required of him by the provisions of this bill there will be obtained a vast amount of information that can be so utilized as to promote the welfare not only of the working men but of all men in this country for i hold to the opinion that labor creates all wealth and that any measure which gives prosperity to the laboring classes must of necessity give prosperity to all other classes i am as much opposed to the creation of new departments of new bureaus and of new offices as any one can be and if it were possible to obtain the statistics sought to be obtained by the provisions of this bill through or by means of any of the departments now in existence i would prefer that it should be done in that way but i do not believe that the investigations will be so thorough and exhaustive as if made by a department charged with this special duty and therefore i favor the passage of the bill census reports made as they are at long stated intervals of time will not answer the purpose sought to be accomplished in this bill the information is needed every year month after month and day by day if possible should the men and women whose labor carries on the industries of these states be furnished with all information that will enable them to
