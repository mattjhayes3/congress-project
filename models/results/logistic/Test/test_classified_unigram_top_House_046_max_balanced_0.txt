public and political life belongs solely to and is a part of the history of that state he was born december 10 1813 in new hampshire in sight of the granite hills of new england grid came to michigan in 1833 before he became of age soon after his arrival in michigan he engaged in mercantile business and laid the foundation of his great fortune showing the same careful untiring energy foresight and straightforward integrity and honesty that followed him through life while thus engaged in active business with quiet persistent and unflagging assiduity he acquired that knowledge of mes and books that became in his after life a surprise even to his best friends constantly employed by day in the busy marts of trade and commerce clearheaded and keen he attended to his constantly increasing business busy hours over the book and the library gave him their richest treasures blessed with a home and fireside where one of the best and noblest of women was ever ready to welcome him and brighten his life whose domestic charm of manner was only surpassed by the winning grace always shown in receiving the welcome friends of her husband his life in early manhood was passed without a thought as i believe of a public career my own first and earliest recollections of him were when as a boy i was placed in his class in the sabbath school of the first presbyterian church of the city of detroit he was then one of the active young men of that church earnestly engaged in all churchwork he took no active part in political life until 1851 when he was elected mayor of detroit in 1857 he was elected senator in place of general lewis cass reelected in 1863 and again in 1869 le was senator continuously from 1857 to 1875 eighteen years he was appointed secretary of the interior in october 1875 and again elected to the senate in 1879 during his senatorial terms occurred some of the most memorable events in the history of this nation looking back now it is easy to see how step by step the united states was gradually drawing nearer and nearer to the most tremendous struggle of ancient or modern times to that crime of crimes a civil war in all the events that go to make up the history of those years mr cihandler was one of the living energetic actors the gradual extension of slave territory in the united states was a rousing the attention the crimes perpetrated under the code of slavery was raising to the pitch of horror the religious and moral sentiment not only of the people of the united states but of the world the kansas civil war was swelling and raising its portentous head on the western frontier old john brown and his hardy sharpshooters im kansas were educating themselves and the nation to a hatred of slavery and the extension of slave territory free speech free territory and free men was being raised as the warcry of a great political uprising after events showed that mr channlfr had given these matters close attention there was filibustering in cuba and in nicaragua by the south jaiuary 28 in hopes of making slave states to offset the rapid growth of the free states of the northwest threats of resistance and secession were openly made by the south the crack of the slavewhip was heard even in congress over the heads of independent men from the north the doctrine that any citizen with his slaves had a right to enter upon anyterritory of the united states and retain his slaves called squatter sovereignty was convulsing the land the atrociouslecompton act was passed the fugitiveslave law with all its attendant horrors was being enforced and northern states passed acts to protect the liberty of their colored citizens like a flash of lightning from a clear sky came the attack of john brown and his army of ten or fifteen men on harpers ferry in virginia and the whole south was thrown into a paroxysm of terror througah fear of a servile war upon all these subjects mr crandler had given his views to the nation in the senate the democratic convention at charleston followed in may 1860 the war of factionsthe south against the northwas the fatal wedge that then and there disrupted the old democratic party substantially the opening gun of the rebellion was fired by that convention and its echoes have never ceased to reverberate to this day in the democratic party from that fatal day in charleston events rapidly hastened to war actual war abraham lincoln was elected president and traitorous hands were busy traitorous hearts were plotting to betray break down and destroy this government a secretary of the treasury utterly uprooted the credit of the government and substantially made it a bankrupt a secretary of war sold its canuon and guns or shipped them to southern arsenals and seat its effective army to outoftheway places on the distant frontier a secretary of the navy sold our ships and naval stores and ammunition sent loyal officers to sea in rotten unseaworthy hulks and scattered the serviceable ships and vessels to ourmost distant stations an attorneygeneral advised the president that he could not use force against a state a chiefjustice refused to issue warrants to arrest traitors every department was demoralized or in traitoreus hands lincoln was inaugurated and then came the first gun of actual war at sumter through all these stormy scenes chaxdler was ever and always watchful ready alert brave and outspoken in the debates and stormy scenes of the senate lie took his full share both of responsibility and debate long before his bloodletting letter he had warned the southern senators that their actions meant for them revolution or a halter he denounced the lecompton act the fugitiveslave bill and the prosecutions under it his painting of the kansas horrors burnings whippings and tortures of men and women who dared advocate free speech and free territories for freemen will stand with the tremendous philippics of the old greek and roman orators and statesmen but time will fail me to enumerate all his labors during the civil war and the years of reconstruction following his great bnsinesi experience his grand executive ability his almost prophetic foresight his extraordinary sagacity and wisdom in the conduct of affairs brought him to the front his judgment in regard to one of the noted generals in command of the army of the potomac showed his wonderful sagacity and decision of character and the strong reliance he had upon the great undercurrents of popular opinion and wisdom to justify his action he denounced this general and in the most positive manner chargel him with failure as a military commander and as utterly incompetent to contduct successfully a great campaign this charge made and substantially proved in the senate and before the country resulted in a change of commanders of the union army and as a further result final victory it was sought subsequently to reverse this decision by an appeal to the people of the country in a presidential campaign but the result showed that chandler was right and his action as proper and patriotic was triumphantly vindicated by the natiou and the removed general became the defeated presidential candidate with the close of the war came another class of legislation and here as everywhere else cihadrlrs clearheaded business experience and ready facility of grasping details and grouping principles and reaching successfully the end came into play there were reconstruction acts and financial acts of stupendous magnitude to be considered revenues in unheardof amounts to be collected taxation to be adjusted and amounts to be raised that staggered the most sanguine a nation of freedmen to be raised to the standard of citizens a race of slaves to be educated to understand the rights and duties and obligations of freemen banking and loan acts legaltender and currency acts treaties to be renewed now relations with foreign nations to be entered into old relations to be strengthened international and constitutional questions new and old arising out of a war unhpard of in its magnitude and astounding as to its results to be settled wounded soldiers to be cared for an army to be disbanded the southern states tobe rehabilitated amendmontsof the constitution to be adjusted to the changed condition of the people in a word the autonomy of the nation was to he reestablished all thesq and a thousand other subjects had to be and were considered by him apparently with equal ease and the proceedings of the senate will show his participation from day to day in them all the great men whose names are linked with the history of the civil war and the rehabilitation of the nation are fast passing away lincoln seward chase stanton greeley wilson sumner morton and now zachaiah chan dt xr have vanished from the scenes and in the records of history and the memories of those still remaining must rest their glorious fame from senator chandlers first entrance into public life he was always the vigorous rapid sledgehammer dealer of telling blowsno fears or quaking as to results when the blow was delivered it was straight from the shoulder vigorous and effective delivered because he believed it necessary and without thinking of the tremendous effect of the stroke to the lookeron often the effect was not immediately apparent it did not seem much of a blow but the next day the next week the next month the effect would be manifest men would be talking of his power and a little speech of ten minutes would be printed in every newspaper talked of on every corner read at every fireside in the city in the country on the mountain in the valley on the plain in the palace down among the miners up among the woodmen in the drawingroom of the swiftrolling express train in the forecastle of the fastspeeding ocean steamer in the pulpit in the pew on the rostrum on the stage rousing the laggard encouraging the timid emboldening the brave nerving the patriotic striking terror to the traitor one element of his power was in his use of clear anglosaxon words meaning exactly what he said and saying exactly what he meant and doing it so clearly that each bearer knew he was but crystallizing into thought and expression the exact floating idea in his own mind in the words that ought to be used he had a masterly way of using plain words for plain people with plain meaning he used no tricks of rhetoric no flowers of speech no studied expression no graceful gesture they would have been utterly out of place with him but his facts would be true and tellinghis speech roughhewed but strong his gestures ungainly but powerful he was listened to by his friends because of their love listened to by his enemies because his power compelled their attention warm positive and magnetic to his friends he was stern unyielding aggressive in the presence of his enemies always however battling for the right as he believed it firm and steadfast in his convictions with him the contest must go on until he was victorious as he was always ready to give blows so he could receive them the story is told of him that amid the exciting scenes preceding the withdrawal of senatorial traitors in 1861 when some of them goaded to madness by his merciless accusations of traitors turned and with fiery southern eloquence hurled stinging epithets and bloody threats and words of frenzied fury at him he sat with a smile of scorn and derision looking them steadily in the face as though he heard them not but pitied their agonized emotions afterward on being asked why he did not reply he said let me tell you a story holding his hands in front of him with his two thumbs together he said do you see one of my thumbs is shoiter than the other twisted and broken well once driving a yoke of oxen in my younger days i got very mad at one of them and raved and tore around considerably and finally as the ox did not seem to care much about it in my rage i struck him as hard as possible with my fist thinking to break a rib at least the sturdy old ox shifted his cud from one side to the other looked around at me very quietly whisked his tail gently as though a fly was tickling himwhile i was just howling with a broken thumb so the senator concluded it often happens that the man who supposes he is giving some one else a stunning blow finds he has only broken his own thumb when mr chandler first appeared in the national political arena in 1856 he announced himself as a candidate for senator general cass whose term was about to expire looked at the audacious young man with undisguised disdain and was not slow to express his contempt for the young man who he said might know how to measure calico and tape sell needles and thread but was not fit to take his place in the council of the nation and added we will remit him to his counter one can imagine the expression of countenance with which in language more strong than polite young chandler replied general cass will find that he spelled his own name without a c when he made that remark from that moment there was on the part of the coming senator constant steady hard work to one end and when the legislature assembled mr chandler was elected and general case relegated to private life in character and in person mr chandler was like a granite block struck from the rugged mountains of his native state roughhewn with jagged corners here and there but solid strong his power of resistance to wrong or injustice whenever or whence it might come his capability of sustaining any load his power to carry and readiness to assume any responsibility made necessary by his position was that of the granite rock always his public life contains no instance of failure friends and patriots could unhesitatingly rely upon his help assistance and counsels to sustain the nation and its defenders enemies and traitors to his last day could rest assured that fie was watchful and ready to interfere between them and injury or insult to the nation or the soldiers of the union to him traitors were a concrete everpresent reality not an abstract faraway entity the definition of treason in the constitution of his country had a personal pointed application to individuals its clearcut definition treason against the united states shall consist only iii levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort his mind instantly applied personally and a citizen of the united states who made war against his own country was a traitor not an erring brother or one who had only been engaged in some unpleasantness an unrepentant rebel was a traitor ever and always yet no one was more ready than he to receive heartily any one desirous of returning to his allegiance to his flag and his country the great leader of the rebellion who with the oath of allegiance almost warm sipon his lips went out from the senate of the united states where he had given his pledge of loyalty to the government ay his own government freely and voluntarily with hand upraised to heaven and calling god to witness his truth to levy war against the united states which act the constitution had declared treason was to him a traitor whose name should nover be enrolled on the roll of honorthe pensionroll of the patriotic loyal maimed and wounded soldiers of the union army chandlers last speech in the senate went to the hearts of his countrymen and will live with those of the distinguished orators and patriots of the early days of the republic that there was one man at least in the senate of the united states who dared to lift an iudignantvoice for patriots and patriotism and against traitors and treason gladdened the hearts and strengthened the hands of millions of citizens the distinction between right and wrong between loyal citizens and rebels between patriots and traitors seemed to be fast dying out till a few burning words in a midnight session forced out of his inmost heart by insulting wrong went like a zigzag stroke of lightning through the wordy sophisms and revealed to an indignant people the insult that was being attempted to land country flag and all the patriotic impulses of the nation it is said that the eagle whenthe storm arises the lightnings flash and thunders roll and heavy winds and black portentous clouds are rushing through the heavens spreads his broad wings and soars above the storm thus it was with our dead friend when peril threatened the country when disaster spread ruin and desolation when mens hearts failed from fear chandler rose above the storm scanned the ruin the disaster the peril and dismay grasped the situation mastered it in all its details and calmly and quietly led the way tosafety he was a born commander and leader of mena power that would and could and did overcome all obstacles in the calm or in the storm in the whirlwind or in the tempest always and ever selfpoised cool daring positive ready for action he was not the lighthouse to show others the way he was the daring navigator who when the light went out and roceson either hand could seize the helm and convey the ship safely into

his enemies but with harness on his steady manly voice ringing in the ears of his countrymen he went down as the warrior in the shock of battle ay and at the very moment of anticipated victory

27 050 00 why one gentleman has said that west of the mississippi the peopie have received onehalf of all of the expenditures of the government for the support of the star service i presume that to be true why should it not be it is west of the mississippi river where the great trade and travel of that section of our country winds its way over wagonroads where this great mail service on horses is carried there is the place where the great stageroutes are located that is where the star service is most needed and where it principally exists there is no such need of it east of the mississippi river as there of course the heavy expenditures are there another member of this committee says that there is something evidently rotten in this management of the star service as it exists at this time because it costs more to maintain it there than it does east of thu mississippi why sir what is there remarkable about that does the honorable gentleman from illinois believe that in the fifteen hundred miles lying through the territory of arizona or across the barren waste of the staked9lain or reaching out over the summit of the rocky mountains and through its rough and tortuous defiles where the mails are to be carried daily on snowshoes through the winter perhaps to be carried over stretches of one hundred miles without water across barren wastes that that service can be performed at the same price that a buggy can be procured to carry the mails across the fertile plains of his own beautiful state of illinois and yet this is the argument that has been made here this is the argument that we are to meet and that is used for the passage of this billbecause the western routes consume so much of the peoples money and we are met with the charge that there is abuse in the service on these routes that frauds have been perpetrated and practiced continually and that great wrong has been done to the people of the whole country in consequence there is not one of them that has brought forward a single argument not a word of evidence in support of the charge of fraud or abuse take any one of these routes that have been mentioned here take for instance the las vegas and vinita route which has been alluded to half a dozen times here that route was ordered by the congress of the united states to be established the postoffice department knew nothing about it it stretches over seven hundred miles of barrenno not barren but wildterritory filled with military posts of the united states with indian agencies and scattered ranches of frontiersmen they let that route by contract but of course the contractor knew that if he secured it he secured the monopoly of it for four consecutive years with all the increasing bnsiness that would naturally come to the route from the establishment of mail service upon it and that he could afford to take it at a very low rate men settle upon all mail routes in the west as soon as they are established and consequently there was much competition for this route and it was bid off finally at some 6 000 it would have cost e25 000 to put the regular service on that route as often as required and in the manner by the contract by all the figures that any route ought to have cost this contractor would have been compelled to pay 25 000 for maintaining service on that route for four consecutive years but he knew as every one of the contractors knew that when a mailroute was put through that country when these indian posts were held together by the mailcarriers trip once a week when the isolated ranches of the hardy frontiersmen of new mexico and texas were once bound together by this mailcarrier route villages would spring up all along the line he knew that new postoffices would be located he knew the service on the route would be largely increased he had the right to take it into consideration they all take it into consideration and they all would be liable to a charge of idiocy if they did not take note of these facts and just what was supposed to be true was found to be so when the route was opened the contractor knew there was to he largely increased service in a short time he could not help knowing it he would simply have been an idiot not to have known it everybody know it when be comes to locate his route he sends to some civilized community and buys ferryboats builds bridges shortens the line of the old military trails in one instance as much as a hundred and fifty miles explores and surveys new routes locates stationhouses digs wells prepares his stock and gathers together all material that he knows he will be called upon in lca s than four years under his contract to have in order to maintain his service and the increase of the service that is sure to come right in the midst of this comes this bill after it has been increased after members of congress by the score have been down to that department and begged to have it increased after the general of the army has asked to have it increased so that military posts may be connected together so that news of indian outrages may be transmitted so that settlers may have correspondence with each otherafter these men have petitioned congress after the board of trade in saint louis have petitioned congress and the merchants exchange and the cotton exchange and representatives and delegates all through that section of the country have sent in petitions with hundreds and thousands of names then the postoffice department under lawunder la mind yonmakes the increase found to be necessary and orders on the service what does this bill do it puts them back without recourse to the original provisions of the original contract the price paid for instance for the purchase of ferryboats and the building of bridges is more than that original contract and that is true of the fort y uma route it is true of these twelve great x72 routes it is true to a great extent of the whole one hundred and seven they have expended more for surveying some of their routes than the whole original contract would have cost why because while you could dillydally on any kind of route with a schedule time of two weeks for instance if the time be shortened up to one week yon require to have a direct line instead of fording a stream in the prairie under a long schedule you have to build a bridge under a short one instead of swimming a horse across a stream with a small mailsack you have to buy a ferryboat for an increased mail and a more rapid transit of it instead of heading a stream on the prairie on long schedule time you must cross it by some means on short schedule time this bill comes in and cuts off the whole increase of service and takes from these men every cent they have expended to build up their route and remands them back to the old original horseback packsaddle method of carrying the united states mails again have you provided under this bill a remedy to reach the routes which have been enormously increased and wrongfully not at all have you put your finger on a fraud and said we will eliminate that i no have you picked out a large route and said this costs too much we will cut it down onehalf no have you examined into the service of any one of these routes and made it pro rata to cost so much per mile no but you have cut down the great colossal framework of the whole star service west of the mississippi river and have carried to those great through lines the stagnation of eternal death do you understand gentlemen of the committee that these great through routes that you thus strike at are the feeders of the little routes that run there have you increased the service on the little route that branches out from this long one i you put it at six times a week or at three times a week you expedite it possibly it is a little ronte its costs very little but after you have done that all through the state or territory after you have increased all the diverging routes you go to work and drive the great trunk line that supplies them all back to this once a week service take your fort yuma and worth route on that you have expedited the service under the operation of this bill you still leave the daily mail along the fort yuma and worth line you do not take that away but on the las vegas and vinita route equally as important with as many postoffices with as much to hope for the future you remand that back to the old packsaddle onceaweek service then it was charged here by the members of the committee that the original contract was so small and the increase so great that that increase must be a fraud the original contract isno criterion at all the gentleman from illinois understands that heunderstands that to secure a line a stage route a postroute running into a mining country like that of leadville or of tucson arizonain all those localitiesa contaactor would agree to take service once a week for nothing if he could get it because he knows as happened once already in colorado that before the time of his contract is out a city or a mining camp will grow up and thousands of men will have to be supplied with the mail and he will get compensation talk of the original contract for a route as being the guide for all subsequent action i know of one firm sanderson co in my state that took a contract to carry uncle sams mail for four years for one cent a year simply to shut out competition and to let the advantages from the future growth and development of the country come to them"], [0.07706314325332642, 0.9229368567466736, 1, "the restriction that

extra session and listened to tirades against the business men of this country until it seems to me the proper time has come when a protest should be entered against this wholesale abuse and denunciation of our most enterprising citizens there are many members of this house who seem to think that true statesmanship consists in persistently maligning the bankers the railroad men the capitalists and business men generally of this our common country and in clamorously claiming that our entire people are on the verge of despair and ready for immediate mutiny at a convention held in this city only a few weeks ago one of its vicepresidents who also happened to be one of its most prominent speakers gave utterance to the sentiment that he wished all the directors of the national banks of this country were in the depths of the lowest hell now such a sentiment might be uttered in an unguarded moment by some frivolous harebrained fanatic and give rise to little comment but the reporters tell us that in this case when the speaker uttered these words he was interrupted with great applause for the space of five minutes just think of the intellectual and moral makeup of an audience that could thus cheer such a fiendish sentiment why sir who are the men who constitute the officers of our national banks or for that matter of all the banks in this country go with me if you please into every village and city of this broad land and you shall find them to be among the very best citizens of each and every place my own observation is that there is hardly an exception to this rule look about you where you will and who are the men whom you would trust with a dying legacy to your wife and children whom you would select to take charge of important interests requiring capacity integrity and honesty or whom you would look to for assistance in times of real want or genuine distress you wll find that among these men your bank directors will be largely represented the same thing may also be said of our railroad men i am not speaking of the railroad wreckers inside ring men and stockjobbers but of the menwho bnuilt and equipped these roads and who manage and operate them there is surely nothing in the nature of their work which makes them unkind or unfriendly to the poor go where you will and you will find no set of men who possess more energy more capacity or who are more keenly alive to a sense of business honor and integritj than these same railroad men they are also everywhere among our ablest and best citizens then why all this abuse some men would fain make

inventors than myself american mechanics and inventors have done more since my remembrance to bring the world from the old ruts and sloughs of pernicious habits or modes of doing business than had been in any other five hundred years of the worlds history of which i have any knowledge i will not detain you by attempting to enumerate the many improvements and discoveries revolutionizing the old modes of doing business and adding so much to our comforts we cannot do too much for inventors we cannot do too much to encourage them to go on with the great work so well started we must not for one moment imagine we are done making improvements the unseen unknown future has an endless amount and variety of improvements calling loudly to us for an introduction to our people andoren world let us withhold no encourage 885 mamch 26 mont from those who are willing to enlist in the great work of bringing them out this business of extending patents by act of congress is not for the interest of inventors but directly opposed to them i have never known an extended patent by act of congress that did not overlay or interfere with some other inventors device or improvements thereby robbing him of the just fruits of his toil and labor these extended patents usually find their way into the hands of speculatos the paperpulp extension is an illustration monopolized by at few wealthy manufacturers who oblige the poor printer and publisher to pay about three cents per pound extra for his paper and it is wonderful to see how tamely the newspapers submit to that great fraud the sewingmachine is another illustration the patent eye pointed needle monopolized the sewingmachine iii this country twentyeight years though there were many hundreds of patented improvements made during the first half of the lifetime of this unjust monopoly some of them were very essential to the eyepoint patent and in fact it could never have been a success without them still the eyepoint patent held them all in abeyance therebyrobbing these inventors of their just rights to it for twentyfive years the poor seamstress was compelled to pay about 40 dollars more for her machine than she would have done but for this monopoly but it coade a batch of millionaires and only robbed a few million poor sewing girls and a few hundred honest inventors i could mention many others but thehistory of one of these swindles is the history of all of them the object of patent laws was to advance to promote the arts and not to retard or put back the result of these extensions by act of congress has been to retard the arts every tiue everywhere and can have no other effect i oppose this extension for the very reason that itis antagonistic to the interest of inventors and a gross wrong to the masses of the people if my position be erroneous i hope gentleinem of more experience and knowledge upon this subject will correct me it was well understood by inventors who took out patents under the seventeenyear law that seventeen years was to be the entire lifetime of their patent they did their work knowing what they were to receive for it when the contract would expire the bonm be over it is all wrong and not in accordance with our institutions to allow anybody to monopolize any device or invention for a great length of time we are a fast people ours is a fast country we cannot afford to give up a patentable invention to any man or body of men for one quarter of a century i have taken out many patents myselfand consider seventeen years long enough for me and i even think that fifteen years would be better real inventors only require a chance to ply their vocation from all the information i can got in regard to this case it is like this this man invented a machine for pegging boots and shoes and driving wooden pegs this machine proved worthless it was probably found that some part of this machine could be made to cover some ground occupied by a later inventor who had brought out a usefnl machine grant this extension and you rob him of his just rights and damuage the public by withholding superior machines from the market we must take away these extended devices we must give

virginia to tell me how much tax west virginia pays into the federal treasury i believe she does not pay on the average more than 300 000 or 400 000 per year as her share how much does she get as a largess from the treasury for her improvements look at page 681 of the report of the chief of engineers in regard to the improvement of one river the great kanawha west virginia it is said here the object of the improvement is to give a constant navigable depth of at least seven fees throughout the whole of the kanawha to its mouth at the ohio river they undertake to do this by locks and dams a statement is made as to the kind of dams and locks and here is a statement of the amount expended june 30 1880 the total amount being 868 680 32 lock 3 is near point creek twentyone and onehalf miles above charleston jerry locks 4 and 5 are respectively near cabin creek and brovnstown fifteen and onequarter and nine and oneeighth miles above charleston ferry dam 3 will create a pool extending as high as cannelton a very important point on the river twentyseven and onehalf miles above charleston ferry the balance available july 1 1880 was 273 319 68 i do not know the amount appropriated in this bill for that special river but the amount in the estimates for the great kanawha for the fiscal year ending june 30 1882 is 350 000 the amount available at the end of the last fiscal year out of the appropriationswas 583 225 76 the amount expended during the year ending july 1 1880 was 309 906 08 leaving amount available july 1 1880 as i have stated 273 319 68 but sir i cannot go into details but i may print from this report still i will say that the amount estimated as required for completing the existing project is 2 410 000 and the amount to be expended in the fiscal year ending june 30 18 2 is 350 000 this is as to one small river in this state so it is as to the elk river in west virginia sums have been expended there which i have not time to quote this is a sample of hundreds of items in this bill which we cannot possibly investigate without having before us the reports of engineers and past appropriations ier is a great volume of hundreds of pages and without index to which we have first had access we are compelled to dive into it on five minutes notice and pick out at a venture some samples like this of elk river the engineer always partial to these appropriations on which his living depends says of elk river these operations were simple in character consisting of the removal of such obstructions to navigation as roks snags overhanging trees and gravel shoals then comes the report of the engineers dated united states engineer office baltimore january 21 1880 it is suggested that any new appropriation for elk river be not restricted to certain portions as in the last case the river needs improvement below the big sandy as well as above before the river can be considered properly prepared for the fall development of the trade upon it which the resources of the country will probably produce and maintain some or all of the private milldams should certainly be removed or modified the expense need not b groat and the miserable lock and dam near charlestown shoul be removed as a nuisance and obstruction to navigation that is the work of removing these little milldams for mill sites or mill purposes in order to allow some little navigation oftentimes these appropriations are really for mill purposes and not navigation the unexpected cheapness and success however of the work of last season lead me to conclude that what remains can be done for very much less than the amount of that estimate which was 00 000 one hundred thousand that is all and for what now turn again to this same elk river to the report to be found on page 692 the engineer says from braxton court house to the mouth of big sandy the traffic consists almost exclusively of logs floated in the river of canoes and small flatboates carrying country produce down stream and

sought or if not seeking he was unfortunate in producing the impression that a distinguished dead senator from the state of kentlicky had introduced into the federal senate chamber the bill which we

that this amendment seeks to repeal does not the gentleman knowif he does not it is his faultthat the amendment incorporated upon this bill which we now seek to repeal was incorporated and ingrafted

of the government and bring it to what should be the qualification of voters and what should be the starvation qualification to hold office it was as the least offensive of two i am willing and those with whom i stand are willing to accept offensive alternatives it was not candid it was not fair the record this issue and we go further we tender it we are the ones to make rebukes the gentleman for

both branches of this legislature and she prothis committee by following out the tergiversations through which poses to signalize her return to power she proposes to celebrate her the republican party has wound itself to this high plane of protest recovery of her longlost heritage by tearing off these degrading against revolutionary legislation why sir the gentleman from badges of servitude and destroying the machinery of a corrupt and ohio in 1872 made a speech upon this floor which he will not deny partisan legislation it was as is always the case with his efforts an adroit as well as an we do not intend to stop until we have stricken the last vestige of able speech in that he declared that the minority to which we then your war measures from the statutebook which like these were born belonged but in which in gods providence we are no longer found of the passions incident to civil strife and looked to the abridgement he declared that the minority were guilty of revolution for what of the liberty of the citizen because they insisted that extraneous matter should not be put upon we demand an untrammeled election no supervising of the ballot appropriation bills he said that was revolution we took him at his word and now where does he staud of his ballot as a conditionprecedent to the passage of your bills it was revolution then to resist the injection of extraneous matter now sir if the gentleman from ohio is to be excused for surely he over the protest of the majority it is revolution now for the ma cannot be justified if he is to be excused for parading before this jority to resist that same protest of that minority but in the one house the threat the argmentito in terrorem of a veto that is already case it was his side protesting in the other case it was ours

for the last seventeen long years and read it carefully and this government will never yield its assent to this measure in its tell me then whether it lies in the mouth of that worthy leader of a present form may i not be warranted and justified in employing once great but waning party to read lectures to anybody either upon equal candor and may i not assure that gentleman and his associates the score of revolutionary legislation or of extraneous introductions that the dominant party of this congress the ruling element of this into appropriation bills better far in the face of the record

shall be allowed to wander from it it is chamber which has demonstrated its power never means to yield but this and nothing more whether the military power shall be or surrender until this congress shall have died by virtue of is limallowed at your polls whether the elections shall be guarded by the itation we will not yield a mailed band of military power whether the ballotbox that last and principle cannot be compromised it may be surrendered but that safest shield of the freemans liberties shall be turned over to the can only be done by its advocates giving proof to the world that they tender mercies of the armies of your land or to state it yet more are crayons and cowards lacking the courage of their own couietersely and probably more fairly it is simply whether the spirit and

better of anyman to find a single scion of the saxon race that has not held days of this republic to him we would never consent to yield such in utter abhorrence the gfforts of hint or them who sought to control dangerous and unwarranted powers to rest the liberties of the citithe freedom of the ballot by the employment of the military power zen upon any one mans discretion nor would he receive it it was not for the earlier but for the later executives of this govthe very army of this country protests against such a prostitution ernment to grasp and seek to retain such questionable prerogatives
