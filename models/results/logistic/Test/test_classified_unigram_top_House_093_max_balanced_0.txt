built in the small business sector the heavy emphasis on the enforcement functions of the law has far outweighed the minimal efforts applied to the educative functions of the law and the resulting imbalance in priority emphasis has resulted in a proportional distortion of perception on the law in the small business sector this distorted perception has been engendered by fear of the unknown fear is a powerful motivatorand it has been used to 3ecure osha compliance however in the long run fear is a debilitating influence i can understand why this motivational force has been employed to date given the small number of inspectors compared with the target population however fear is a positive motivator only when a clearly defined course of action to avoid punishment is available in the absence of such a clearly defined course of action tension and anxiety build up and it is this tension and anxiety th t have been exploited by those who seek to eviscerate the law or wipe it off the books entirely we can remove this fear and anxiety by providing an o portunity for the small businessman to obtain consultation on potential problem areas in his business on the site where his business activities take place offsite consultation is simply not adequate to meet the special needs of the small business sector can we expect the small businessman to bring his machinery to some neutral territory for inspection can we realistically expect him to memorize every detail of his business the machinery in his shop the work habits of his employees and relate these to an offsite counselor requiring him to seek advice in such a manner is not unlike arranging the terms of a duel on some neutral ground how can we expect any businessman to develop a positive perception on the merits of voluntary compliance under such conditions there is a vast difference between the capabilities the capital and the legal resources that are available to the small and large business sectors this onsite consultation amendment seeks to restore a balance between the comparative advantages held by either sector this is a positive step in the right direction to encourage voluntary compliance
