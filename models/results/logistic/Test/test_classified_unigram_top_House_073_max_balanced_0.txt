economic monetary trade and disarmament issues para phrasing julius caesar they came they saw and they went home apparently a good time was had by all but nobody knows what it was all about least of all the foreign statesmen who were much feted and presented with extensive formulasy unequaled tariff reductions z equaled inflation and x represented the unknown quantity or reduction in war debts the visiting statesmen on their return home have had much difficulty in explaining these formulas satisfactorily to their governments and fitting the pieces into the right places in the picture puzzle why not as no democrat has yet been able to inform the american public whither we were going on the war debts embargoes or league of nations of course no republican can even venture a solution of the recent conference puzzles at washington none of them were invited to attend the conferences or to make suggestions for the first time in american history since we became a world power partisanship was injected into international issues in spite of our traditional practice and policy to the contrary the socalled new deal as applied to foreign affairs by the brain trust was to ignore the sound american policy of permitting partisanship to cease at the waters edge the visiting foreign statesmen were guests of the nation not of the democratic party nevertheless republicans who represent the opposition party were not to be trusted to even meet these foreign statesmen or they might be contaminated prime minister macdonald was regaled at a big state dinner at the white house without the benefit of any republicans from the house of representatives and but one from the senate the democratic program of a new deal on international issues apparently is the old wilson deal or internationalism rampant entrance to the league by the front door the back door or the trap door embargoes to enforce article xvi of the league of nations covenant to punish aggressor nations consultative pacts bargaining tariffs at the expense of american labor and as to reduction or cancelation of war debts only time will tell as the democrats have ignored the issue and apparently up to date have no definite policy except that we will confer with you later in the meanwhile the war debts have been reduced another 25 percent by going off the gold standard in spite of the democraticplatform pledge to preserve a sound currency at all hazards europe has been informed by messrs hull and norman davis that america will surrender her protective tariff both of whom propose to tear down our tariffs and thus open wide the floodgates of cheap european and asiatic goods to create further unemployment in the united states the republican party although not invited to participate in the washington conferences stands on international issues where it has always stoodagainst international alliances and entanglements and places the safety and interests of the united states first last and all the time the republican party is opposed to entrance into the league of nations or to giving the president power to place embargoes against an aggressor nation which would destroy the timehonored neutrality policy of our country proclaimed by george washington in 1793 and adhered to since then by every president the republicans in the house of representatives regard the proposed embargoonarms power to the president to be dangerous and revolutionary tending to lead us into war instead of preserving peace the republican national platform of 1932 is explicit in its opposition to cancelation of war debts and for the preservation of the american standard of living and wages of the american wage earner through an adequate protectivetariff policy the republican party will continue to stand for complete independence of action by the united states on all international issues and against involving our country in european affairs by entering the league of nations or limiting or abolishing our traditional policy of neutrality in opposition to the democratic program as recently developed we stand without compromise on international issues for american independence american sovereignty american neutrality and american interests and safety the democratic party has on the advice of the brain trust deliberately injected partisanship into the conduct of our foreign policy and the republican party accepts without fear or favor this issue which has been flung in its face since 1920 under republican administrations such wellknown and distinguished democrats as oscar underwood owen young bainbridge colby joseph t robinson democratic leader of the senate and claude a swanson now secretary of the navy have been appointed and served as delegates at important international conferences with the exception of senator james couzens who has pursued a nonpartisan course in congress and refused to support the republican party candidates in the recent presidential election no republican has been appointed as a delegate to the london economic conference i admit that if it were not for the blatant partisanship for the first time being deliberately thrust into foreign affairs that i would be reluctant to criticize the democratic members perhaps even now the less said out of kindness the better none of the delegates have had any experience in international conferences or european affairs none have any knowledge of foreign languages or have traveled extensively abroad or understand conditions there in brief the american delegation represents the new deal at the international conference or innocence abroad and naturally the london conference is doomed to failure secretary hull a student of the tariff from a freetrade point of view in his many years of distinguished service in the house and senate never was on the foreign affairs committee of either house or showed any interest in international issues except as an advocate of the league of nations senator key pittman of nevada the smallest state in population in the union has had considerable experience on the senate committee on foreign relations and may be an important factor in stabilizing currencies and fixing an equitable price for silver by international agreement the only thing that can be said of the other members is that they are all adherents of the league of nations and inclined to free trade two of the six members come from the state of tennesseesecretary hull and representative mcreynoldsand in addition there is mr norman h davis our ambassador at large who hails likewise from tennessee the great states of new york pennsylvania and illinois are unrepresented as is also new england of course the work of our delegates at the london economic conference has been considerably lessened as mr norman h davis and ambassador robert bingham have already committed us to scrap our traditional neutrality policy and to join the league of nations in selecting the aggressor nations i prefer to leave mr davis to the tender mercies of my colleague representative tinkia but cannot refrain from saying a few words about the recent address of ambassador bingham before the pilgrims society at which he declared the roosevelt message recently delivered in geneva regarding neutrality marked a definite departure from certain principles maintained by the united states since the nation was founded it does not contain a reservation retained by great britain in the locarno treaty but from my standpoint i do not believe there is a 10yearold child of average intelligence anywhere in the world who could fail in the event of war to select instantly the aggressor mr bingham apparently does not realize that historians are still disputing as to which nation started the world war or that no nation has been agreed upon as the aggressor nation for over a hundred years it is this remark about the aggressor nation and the 10yearold child that impelled mr hearst one of the leading democratic campaigners in the recent election to state publicly that he now understood the reason for the word ass in ambassador both norman davis and ambassador bingham have misrepresented the united states and should be recalled how can the american people expect anything from an international conference at which we have committed ourselves in advance to destroy our traditional policy of neutrality to enter a consultative pact to apply embargoes against the aggressor and to join in enforcing the most iniquitous provisions of the versailles treaty and the league of nations the conference will open at london on june 12 with many social festivities but it will not get down to serious work before june 15 when the wardebt payments to the united states are due france has refused to pay her war debt to us which only amounts to the sum which we loaned her after the armistice great britain is threatening to default and so is italy although we settled on a basis of 25 cents on the dollar or much less than we loaned her after the war was actually ended president roosevelt has refused to permit the american delegates to the economic conference to discuss the war debts which is the only big issue in the mind of every delegate attending the economic conference from european nations the house of representatives in which wardebt settlements must be initiated has shown no inclination to cancel or even reduce war debts until european nations agree to reduce their huge budgets for military and naval armaments the overwhelming sentiment of both parties in the house is against any form of cancelation which will unload the financial burdens of the world war on the backs of the american taxpayers who were in no way responsible for the origin of that war william c bullitt now an assistant to secretary of state hull but a few months ago acting as an unofficial ambassador informed eurpean nations that they would not have to pay more than 10 percent of the war debts to the united states which means that the american people already burdened with taxes can pay the balance secretary of state hull has since he arrived in london made the most amazing public statement emanating from the roosevelt administration that we would loan more money to foreign nations curiously overlooking the fact that these nations are the very ones which are repudiating their war debts to us what is the magic of london and the thames that bewitches the intellects of our american statesmen are its waters those of lethe that they should benumb the senses and befuddle the brain of our secretary of state is the loan of 50 000 000 made to china through the reconstruction finance corporation a part of the hull foreign program what is it that comes over an american statesman as soon as he gets abroad are the american taxpayers always to be shorn like lambs and pay for european armaments why should we loan a penny to any foreign nation until we can balance our budget put our own house in order and pay our just debts to our own war veterans with serviceconnected disabilities germany just a few days ago declared a moratorium on all international debts both public and private in addition to our 5 democratic delegates and senator couzens there are 45 advisors economists statisticians secretaries and stenographers and 15 relatives of members of the party numerically we ought to be able to present an entire football team with mr rexford guy tugwell of the brain trust as quarterback some weeks ago the president declared that he looked upon government as a football team which if it failed to make gains by certain plays ought to try some others as this was spoken the american collegiate cabinet team was in a huddle trying to devise some new shifts which might advance the ball of its political prestige further into opposition territory the backfield has now fallen back to receive the kickoff from europe our plays are to be international financial and economic the game has started and the ball is in the air but i know of one famous game in the rose bowl in california a couple of years ago where one of the best players caught the ball and ran in the wrong direction only to make a touchdown against his own team i fear this is what will happen to president roosevelts new team of delegates to the economic conference at london i fear that norman davis ambassador bingham or even secretary hull or his substitute mr moley may at any moment make a touchdown in europes favor this has invariably happened in these international football games when our team gets its signals mixed with foreign entanglements or forgets to play the game according to sound american principles and traditions the american team composed almost entirely of freetraders and advocates of the league of nations are apt to lose their shirts or in football language their jerseys on the kickoff there is not a member of our team under 60 and i am afraid that they cannot last the first quarter at any rate the american team individually and collectively will be lucky to emerge from the london conference gridiron with any more clothes than mr gandhi we can then have the satisfaction of saying with true american collegiate spirit as is often done after the opposition team has triumphed by a score of 50 to 0 didnt our boys put up a plucky and courageous fight there is not a single foreign policy on which i see eye to eye with president roosevelt which will be discussed at the london conference i am out of sympathy with the attempt of the president to involve the united states in foreign entanglements consultative pacts embargoes or having the united states act as an enforcement agent for the league of nations and the versailles treaty every time we stick our fingers in the european pie instead of pulling out a plum we are more apt to lose our fingers or pull out some high explosives we should cease passing moral judgments on other nations and stop meddling in their affairs there never was a time in our history when it was more important for the safety and welfare of our own people to mind our own business and put our own house in order let us cooperate with european nations and all other nations for the preservation of world peace but let us be sure that we do not become entangled in every foreign dispute

and depreciated it abroad that we have lowered the tariff and statements have been made again and again by gentlemen of the opposition just as my colleague has made the statement that we have in effect altered by the revaluation program the value of the dollar to such an extent that we have lowered the tariff rates as a matter of fact the reverse is true let me take a practical example when england was on gold and we were on gold the british pound was worth 4 84 and if an englishman wanted to buy an american typewriter he took 10 to the bank in order to get 50 to buy an american typewriter then england went off gold and the british pound went down from 4 84 to 4 and down to 3 50 and finally to 3 11 and instead of bringing 10 to the bank and get 50 he had to bring 16 to the bank to get the same amount of money this prohibited the importation into england from our country of our products and this extended to all other items then we went off gold 2 years too late as was testified before our committee by gentlemen who represented your point of view they made admissions that we went off too late but when we did go off gold the american dollar depreciated and the british pound in terms of american dollars went up from 3 11 to 3 50 to 4 and ultimately i believe to 5 50 so that once again the british citizens abroad wanting to buy an american product instead of bringing 16 to the bank to get 50 brought once again 10 and then 9 and as we further depreciated the dollar by altering the gold content of that dollar we depreciated it on the foreignexchange market and made possible the depreciation to the extent that foreigners can buy goods in this country to export abroad and we encouraged our export trade the contention that this revaluation program was a lowering of tariff rates is unsound because when you reverse the position and have an american buying goods abroad with cheap american dollars which have purchased dear foreign currencies you have increased your tariff by the same percentage that you have devaluated the dollar the contentions of the gentlemen of the opposition to the contrary notwithstanding are based upon a fallacy and a misunderstanding of the actual policy that was involved every nation in this world except holland and switzerland and the united states revealed their gold at percentages ranging from 65 or 70 percent to 150 percent in the case of japan and 300 percent in the case of italy and france and we were only following belatedly a policy with reference to our monetary program that was in accord with the realities of international trade and for the purpose of reinforcing our export trade that monetary policy which was an integral part of the recovery program did stimulate our export trade now this present tariff measure is for the purpose of supplementing and completing and reinforcing that monetary policy so that we will have reciprocal opportunities to deal with foreign nations on a basis of equality with the same instruments and tools and devices that they use in order that we can restore to american workers two or three millions of them the livelihood that they gain from pursuits that engage in international trade the opposition should not become alarmed at the mere suggestiofi of the reduction in the rates of duty the enactment of the gold reserve act of 1934 has automatically led to an increase from 50 to 70 percent in the cost of imports from goldstandard countries an increase which has been somewhat less from countries having a depreciated currency even if a uniform reduction of 50 percent were made in all rates and no such thing is contemplated by the pending bill the rates on imports from goldstandard countries would still remain above the height of the hawleysmoot act which i am sure our protectionist friends on the other side consider high enough the honorable daniel c roper secretary of commerce in his testimony before the ways and means committee on the pending bill made the following statement regarding the increased protection resulting to domestic producers by reason of the devaluation of the american dollar i quote from pages 65 and 66 of the ways and means committee hearings with the recent devaluation of the american dollar to 59 cents it now takes nearly 69 percent more dollars to pay for any particular foreign import shipment than it did a year ago assuming the foreign price has not changed there has thus been brought into operation an additional allaround tariff protection or handicap on imports which has been in only small measure offset by increased costs of production or prices of domestic products resulting from the n r a or other recovery measures in other words prices in this country could increase to approximately 70 percent over a year ago before domestic producers would be under any increased pressure from foreign imports except insofar as the exchange value of particular foreign currencies have also depreciatedand very few have depreciated as much as the american dollar"], [0.8097532391548157, 0.8097532391548157, 0, "rear admiral james j raby united states navy commandant of the sixth seventh and

bribery upon me yesterday he asked me how much time i was getting from mr mcreynolds and i replied 5 minutes he then said he would give me 10 minutes if he had only said 15 minutes i do not know what i would say today on this bill because it seems to me that you can be equally illogical in arguing on either side of the bill our democratic friends insist in their report in playing up mr stimson and mr hoover if there was anything that determined the american people in the last campaign it was the foreign policy of mr stimson and mr hoover i think hereafter that the less we say about stimson and hoover in democratic reports the better off we will be why the republicans have chosen an international issue to break with the president is beyond me because if they fell down in anything it was in their conduct of international affairs their argument on this bill is that it has a tendency to make us violate neutrality in another republican administration we declared war but we did not mean anything we declared war against war that we would be the champions of peace and always be against war there was a great war on against war that was the purpose of the kellogg pact for which they claim so much credit and when we adopted the kellogg pact we immediately scrapped all our traditional policies concerning neutrality because we bound ourselves there and then always to be against war always to be against the aggressor nation but now they come and say to us that the kellogg pact was a great thing a declaration of policy but it really did not mean anything because there was no way of finding the aggressor nation which of course to the logical mind if any exists now in the nation is utterly ridiculous i am for this bill really because it shows that we are doing something in this war against war that means something we are actually sanctioning the kellogg pact i did not believe in it it did not seem to me to be of much use because no declaration of policy no written words without sanction behind them have ever meant anything to me and the kellogg pact never meant anything because it had nothing in the way of sanction talk about this resolution driving us into war if anything could drag us into war it was the kellogg pact we left ourselves wide open countries are always at war or about to go to war every movement in international relations every peace conference every huddle of diplomats in geneva or anywhere else is not a peace movement it is always a war movement there is danger of war breaking out any minute and to my mind this bill is a step in

an equality with the states with regard to the manufacture and sale of beer it is absolutely important that we pass this bill today that is the reason for bringing in this bill so that the people of the district of columbia may have the same advantage as the people in the rest of the country when the sale of beer is permitted there is little i can add to what has been said here today except on the question which seems to agitate so many membersrespecting minors i do not believe that 3 2 beer is intoxicating or should be considered intoxicating because nobody has the capacity to drink enough of it to really become intoxicated nevertheless i should be very glad to and shall offer an amendment today restricting the sale of this beverage to minors in the district of columbia and i do so not because i believe it is going to do the minors any harm but because a great many people seem to think that some advantage might be taken in the places where the beer is on sale and that other kinds of drink may be substituted therefore i should be glad when we come to that part of the bill to offer that amendment unfortunately the people of the district have nothing to say about the national prohibition bill therefore we must speak for them and i sincerely hope that every member of the house will legislate for the people of the district who have no right to express themselves with regard to their own government just as he would legislate for his own state and if we do that i have not a doubt that we shall deal fairly with them today and pass this bill"], [0.0002829432487487793,

the services of these men and declining to give in return by reason of this provision a fair rate of pay to them i have heard no explanation of why a captain or a commander or a lieutenant commander who is assigned to this work and who is performing this duty should receive the pay of a lieutenant who has only had 10 years of service in the navy i cannot conceive of any explanation it seems to me if the government is to utilize the services of these men it should pay them according to their worth of course it may be argued that the pay is high the pay of any senior officer of the army or navy when he has attained a high degree of proficiency and efficiency may seem to some rather high but they are performing services that merit that pay one of them is acting as adviser of the naval affairs

postmaster general only had 2 days more in office what powerful motive was working in his breast to make him violate all precedents heretofore established by those going out of office to make him violate the express provisions of the law so plain a wayfaring man though fool he be can understand yet he enters into the contracts under those circumstances 2 days before his term expires is that
