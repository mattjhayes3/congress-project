question i wish to ask attention particularly to the last paragraph of this pending amendment of the gentleman from kentucky and its effect that paragraph providesthat whenever the dominion of canada admits prod ucts wares and merchandise grown produced or manufactured in theunited states free of duty then the products wares and merchandise grown produced or manufactured in said dominion of canada shall be admitted free of duty here is free trade in reality but upon a small scale i can not understand why the gentleman from kentucky offered this amendment unless it was upon the theory that he wishes now to go beyond the preent controversy and to throw the dark shadow of what he and his party friends intend as a coming event upon this debate and thus attract the attention of the country this certainly seems to be a project to establish free trade with can ada and in the direction of that general free trade toward which the democratic party is now distinctly moving i am aware sir that this project of reciprocity is a proposition which in one form or another has received some support from men upon both sides my very respected friend from ohio has from time to time taken much interest in a project for as he says extending the american tariff wall so as to include the united states and canada i wish to warn that gentleman who represents so ably the important interests of ohio the manufacturing interests and the metal interests that are so valuable to his constituents that he is digging at the foundations of a great edifice and if he does not have a care he~lnay tumble down the whole structure about him his project unless guarded as perhaps he hopes to guard it is avery dangerous one i consider it a very dangerous one in any event but the scheme contained in the proposition and the argument presented here by the gentleman from kentucky is a blow to the farmers the mechanics and the manufacturers of this country it is a direct attack upon the farmers uponthe whole border line from the pacific ocean to the atlantic where would our farming interests stand along the northern line of the states if this plan were carried out how should we succeed for example with the raising of potatoes and in the manufacture of starch the canadians can raise potatoes and can manufacture and put their starch upon the market cheaper than we can ours because of the cheaper lands of the provinces and the high wages of american workingmen and because of the habits and customs of the two people and we should be unable to compete with them without going to their level again this proposition offers to open our markets to the great wheat region of the canadian northwest the manitoba country it would give to about five millions of canadians this great market of over sixty millions of people as to everything raised produced or manufactured in canada without our receiving any adequate consideration in return i submit that this is a proposition to bring the canadians into direct competition with us in our markets not only in lumber fish and ores but in seeds grain vegetables meats animals and everything that canadians produce manufacture or obtain in their own country thetoronto globe understands this subject better than our opponents on this floor and it truthfully says of its own interests if we had reciprocity that capital which we have been so often told lies in the united states waiting for investment in canada would find its way to us new smelting works would be set up not only in nova scotia but also in many parts of ontario and quebec as the demand for charcoaliron has become so great in the united states that it can scarcely besupplicd thedevelopmentofourcoal and iron mines would be of incalculable benefit that our experience has proved we can not reasonably expect unless the great market of the united states be opened to us our other mineral wealth would also be developed despite duties meant to be prohibitory we sent to the united states in t886 of crude gypeum 101 737 tons of copper ore 5 224 tons of plumbago 3 645 hunf dred weight of salt 3s4 283 bushels of stone 14 850 tons and small quantities omanganese silver ore phosphates etc it is evident that what we supply in small quantities despite prohibitory duties we would supply in large quantities were those duties removed the high import duty system has failed completely to develop our mineral wealth the only means of developing that wealth satisfactorily is unrestricted reciprocity which would give us free admission to a market of 60 000 000 of people certainly the canadians know what they want and why they want it the strange thing about the matter is that they find americans who are ready and quick to serve them another effect of the proposed amendment if adopted will be to develop the shipping of the canadians on the northern lakes the theory of the canadians is the same as that of great britainthe building up of their maritime strength wherever there has been an opportunity we have seen that this is their course they would control the carrying trade of the lakes and the great rivers by their laws now in force they not only compel us to pay tolls through their canals and when our vessels are bound to american ports refuse the rebate allowed to vessels destined for canadian ports but they go further not only do they exhibit a jealous spirit in such matters as wrecking referred to by my colleague but they permit the bottoms which represent canadian shipping to come into and leave their ports for a whole year with only a single charge of 50 cents paid once while the american bottoms that go into canadian ports are taxed by charges of entry fees exit fees and other charges they protect their own interests it has been truly said elsewhere that by reciprocityour navigation laws which enable our citizens to maintain a commercial marine on the great lakes would be blotted out and the inevitable result would be that commerce in american bottoms would be driven from the lakes as it has been from the ocean the canadians are ready for thi commerce again the canad ians would with the assistance of british steamshlpcompanics monopolize imports for distribution to the lake cities and the west through the viclland canal and over the great lakes imported goods culd be sent to all of tue lake cities more clitaply fromn montreal than from new york the import duties being the same montreal would grow at the expenseof new york and boston and the great highway of commerce would be down the st lawrence we have had some experience in canadian reciprocity and are not in haste to have it repeated if canadians want the benefit of our institutions and our markets and of our scale of prices and wages let them come as thousands of the most progressive and energetic are now coming and let them become citizens of the great republic let us be done with this attempt to annex the united states to canada"], [0.038590651005506516,

mind was that in the confusion prevailing in the house at the time i thought the gentleman did not understand the amendment which i proposed to offer was a substantial amendment germane to the paragraph which i had in view and one which would bring before the committee facts i thought necessary to enable the committee to form a proper judgment as to the disposition of this question dextrine burnt starch gum substitute and british gum are on the tariff schedule at a different point and under a different classification from pctato starch but are manufactured products of potato and corn starch they enter into consumption in this country in direct and disastrous competition with the manufacturer of potato starch on the present tariff schedule these substances have a duty levied upon them of 1 cent per pound the duty is entirely too low the duty is not in conformity with any principle of tariff levying that can be justified as i will endeavor to show to the house dextrine gum substitute and british gum are imported into this country and used for precisely the same purpose forwhich potato starch is employedfor starching fabrics for sizing fabrics for printing cloths and purposes of that kind under this classification of the tariff by which these articles are permitted to come in at the low rate of duty of 1 cent per pound the result has been that since 1883 the importation of these gums has almost doubled in 1883 there were imported 2 639 000 pounds in 1887 there were imported into this country of these gums and dextrine 5 617 751 pounds now on the average 1 bushel of potatoes will produce 8 pounds of potato starch at the present rate of duty of 2 cents per pound that would be a duty of 16 cents on the potato starch on a bushel of potatoes under the existing tariff and under the tariff as i understand it is to be left by the mills bill as the gentleman from arkansas explained this morning the duty on a bushel of potatoes is 15 cents now 1 bushel of potatoes producing 8 pounds of starch would under the proposed tariff admit the manufactured product of a bushel of potatoes at 8 cents duty while the raw potatoes themselves have to pay 15 cents per bushel that is manifestly contrary to any just principle of tariff duties but this gum substitute and dextrine is a still more advanced product of the potato starch it requires about lpounds of starch to make a pound of gum substitute or dextrine and yet at the rate of 1 cent per pound while the bushel of potatoes in the e raw state would have to pay 15 cents duty this highly manufactured a product of the bushel of potatoes would come in at 5k cents 5k pounds e of gum substitute or british gum coming in at 1 cent per pound would pay only 5l cents in other words the product of the potato advanced two stagesfirst to the stage of potato starch and then to the still further manufactured stage of dextrine or gum substitutewould come u in for 5f cents while the bushel of potatoes would pay 15 cents in f other words again the nmanufactured product would be admitted at about onethird of the duty that was imposed on the raw material g that is a condition of things that certainly ought not to exist now g my amendment proposes to putthis duty upon this gum dextrine and substances of that kind at a rate proportionate to the duty which is o laid upon the raw material s the chairman the

over and above all other articles but i am here to say a word for this lead industry because it is one of the important industries of my state and of the western territories and because also i was somewhat at a loss to understand when my colleague from missouri was making his able argument upon this question a while ago whether or not he tended to free trade or to protection i recognize fully the great injustice done to the lead miners of missouri and of the territories by the unjust ruling of the treasury department but sir i think it will not remedy that injustice but will only impose additional burdens upon them burdens too grievous to be borne should the proposition contained in this bill be carried out striling off onehalf of the existing duty upon lead ore it is a fact well known to every man who is familiar with lead minesand i happen to have beenreared intheir midst in the state of wisconsin it is i say afact well known to every man familiar with the leadmining business that there are no men anywhere who work harder than these miners there are no men who earn every cent they receive better than do those men who go down into the bowels of the earth and bring up the lead ore to the surface and to the market and taking the position cited by the gentleman from michigan as taken by the distinguished chairman of the committee on ways and means only a few years since namely that to decrease the duty is to increase the importation this change simply means that while this purports to be a bill to reduce the surplus it is in fact in this respect a bill to increase the revenue upon the articles mentioned the duties collected in the last year for which we have figures amounted to only 12 000 the estimate given by the committee on ways and means of the effect of the passage of this part of their bill is that if it becomes law it will decrease the revenue by the almost infinitesimal amount of 6 000 and i submit to every gentleman upon the other side of the house that should they reduce this duty threefourths of a cent per pound they will throw down the barrier now set up against the importation of spanish lead into this country they will break down a great leading industry of missouri they will cripple the mines of missouri and kansas they will close many of the silver mines of new mexico and of the other territories and they will do all this for what purpose simply for the purpose of giving free entrance to a foreign material now let me say to my democratic friends from missouri that i stand here as the distinguished senator from their state stood in 1884 when he said that he was not here to help massachusetts connecticut or pennsylvania but that there was an infant industry in his statethe lead industry and zinc industryand that if in the line of a tariff for revenue he could protect those interests he proposed to do so in the district represented by my colleague there are cities whose prosperity whose existence almost depends upon this industry strike it down and you strike them down not one pound of this article is produced in my district but sir the prosperity of every other district in that great state is inseparably interwoven with the prosperity of the great commercial city which i in part represent upon this floor and our people simply demand fair treatment why strike down this industry when even by your own figures you save only 6 000 why do it let me say further that if you close the lead mines of the west and admit your foreign ore free of duty you will transfer the leadpipe manufacture the sheetlead manufacture the whitelead manufacture the shot manufacture all from the mississippi valley to the atlantic seaboard and i do trust that gentlemen representing this western country will stand

beneficial changes as they have been moved by this side of the chamber i am therefore admonished in advance that the brief observations i now have the honor to submit on the radical changes proposed in the schedule of duties on foreign wool importation will be without avail my purpose therefore in rising at this time is rather to give voice to the prevailing sentiments of my constituency in protest of the legislation contemplated and which vitally affects one of their leading and most valued industries in the form of petitions and memorials they are already of record the profound anxiety of our people is at once appreciated when it is understood that my state ranks fourth among the woolgrowing states california is first on the roll with 5 462 728 sheep texasfollows next in order with 4 523 739 head ohio third with 4 106 622 and oregon fourth with 2 930 123 head the value of the same being 4 987 069 for this one state the number of sheep in the three pacific states amount to 9 053 847 to which add 2 127 783 in the territories of washington idaho and montana west of the rocky mountains and we have on the pacific slope more than onefburth of the total sheep flocks of the entire nation this conveys at the outset a proof of the great importance of the wool industry to that section of the union nor does this measure the possible maximum of its growth the advancement of the last few years afford us assurances of a continued and greater development for the future with free wool into the united states and a competition with the cheapest of all cheap labor of the world it does not require argument to demonstrate that the cheaper product must soon supplant the more costly and in the end we shall approach and rapidly too the destruction throughout the whole nation of a product which now yields to the country annually 75 000 000 to this may be added the disappearance of the flocks themselves which are valued at 90 000 000 and which now produce our mighty wool yield that this will result we have only to recur to past experience in our affairs by the reduction of duties in the tariff act of 1883 we trace a falling off in the number of sheep from 50 626 626 in 1884 when the act took effect to 44 759 314 head in 1887 only three years following with free foreign wool they will all go and what was the further consequences of this unfortunate reduction our foreign wool importations increased from 70 575 478 pounds in 1883 to 129 084 958 pounds in 1886 the ostensible purpose of the pending bill is to reduce the revenue if these were as great in amount on wool as are the duties on sugar less surprise could exist for the foreign wool duty only amounted to 5 899 817 last year it is for this then the great sacrifice must be made to save sugar yielding 15 000 000 per annum we are yet to pay 45 000 000 under the proposed reduction while to destroy wool yielding 75 000 000 to the country we avoid duties of about 6 000 000 and yet this is asserted to be unbiased impartial legislation some have the effrontery to dignify it as statesmanship but there is another injury which must follow this legislation it is in the diminution of the meat supply and the consequent increase of price mutton is now one of the cheapest as well as most nourishing of foods and hence more in reach ot the laboring man and the poorer classes reduce the price of wool and there will be less inducement to raise the mutton sheep the cost will be greater if it be argued that free wool brings cheaper clothing it may be replied that the present cheaper cost of meat amply counterbalances the difference in duty on clothing in this view of the matter it is not alone the woolgrower who is interested but every member of society the mutton sold in our home market annually amounts to 15 000 000 of the millions of american citizens who are now profitably engaged in sheep husbandry and who must suffer a sacrifice largely of capital and entirely of occupation and employment it is needless to comment the loss to the country as well as the individuals in the wages received will be severely felt the immense revenue now left with us and the propirty and earnings which go to make american homes prosperous contented and industrious will be transferred to foreign landsto australia new zealand and south america there to enrich english nabobs and spanish grandees and to feed clothe and shelter the cheap and degraded herders of those climes their flocks will produce thewool for our consumption and manufacture they will derive the profits and receive the wages now so richly the portion of our own people seventyfive millions of dollars now our own earnings must annually be sent out of the country to replace the destroyed product with a foreign supply necessary for our home demand and this in the face of the fact that we are today the second greatest woolproducing nation on the globe and with the further fact that we consume all the wool we produce it is as mr blaine so tersely and so well said to break down woolgrowing and be dependent on foreign countries for the blankets under wllch we sleep and coats that cover our backs is not wise policy for the national government to enforce but this will not close the enumeration of our probable losses much of our domain in the west utilized by woolgrowers and especially that portion distant from lines of transportation is at present unfit for any other use in the dry seasons water is distant and scarce the soil incapable of tillage and unfitted for the occupancy of the agriculturist and yet a species of grass is found indigenous to the soil which affords nourishment to the sheep to these waste and desert plains the herders resort with immese flocks and it is on such otherwise valueless lands that a large per cent of the american wool is produced and annually finds its way to the home market to become the manufactured fabric for our people with free foreign wool to the american market and competition with a product of cheap foreign sheep cheap foreign lands cheaper foreign labor and low foreign interest we render utterly useless a large part of our western domain and can say thrice farewell to the american wool industry it is such practical reflections as these which appeal more directly to the classes interested you may theorize until doomsday upon t manufactures of our country which are to be stimulated to incre product of fabric by reason of cheaper wool and hence as a result an increased demand and better prices but such absurdities are soon detected and react upon the designing or deluded politician who utters them lower duties and higher prices are demonstrated in practice to be a fallacy no greater delusion was ever preached the mere attempt at this time to lower the duties has so agitated the market that prices have reached a most unprofitable minimum the woolgrower sadly turns his back upon the market and breathes inprecations upon the authors of his injury five cents loss in the market on every pound of his wool product does not inspire him with admiration for free trade if he is a member of the dominant party his ardor is gone he feels it to be his enemy not his friend the friend of england not of america the destroyer of home industries the ally of foreign interests it is thus the people of the nation are thinking today and quietly resolving in november next to administer such a rebuke to free trade and by such a vote as has never had an equal before it why sir what better illustration of popular condemnation of the pending measure can be found than in the vote recently cast in my own state about onefourth of the opposition evidently united with the republicans to storm free trade from a republican plurality of 1 635 two years ago it is 7 504 plurality now over 60 000 votes were cast it is humorously asserted that even the sheep voted on our side for as it is said in holy writ a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers the issue between the parties was sharply made shall the radical changes proposed in the mills bill be approved shall the future policy of this government be protection or free trade the democratic state convention resolvedthat we most earnestly and unqualifiedly indorse the policy of tariff revisioa and a reduction of the surplus revenues to the needs of the government economically administered as set forth in the presidents last annual message t6 coigress the republican convention resolved that the policy of the democratic administration which would place wool and lumber on the freelist and woolen goods on the highly protected list cottonties on the freelist and other similar hoopiron on the protected list and which policy would continue the collection of 50 00 000 on sugar each year while at the same time the majority applaud and claim to carry out the presidents idea that a tariff tax is a robbery of the people constitutes a piece of unparalleled political dishonesty having for its sole object the success of the democratic party at the next election even at the expense of the political destruction of many of our most important agricultural and manufacturing industries the leading democratic paper of the state on the day preceding the election said they are trying to scare the democracy of oregon with the wolfcry of wool we can not afford longer to defer to the selfishness or blindness of even so valuable a class of men as the woolgrowers they must be taught as many of them already understand that an excessive high tariff is a curse rather than benefit even to them the oregonian the leading republican paper of the state said until oregon can be made to understand why cleveland took a club to pound the wool industry to death while he continues to pat and stroke and feed the louisianatiger sugar monopoly oregon will not be carried by the democracy every county and precinct was closely canvassed both parties sent out their ablest exponents and eloquent orators from other states participated oregon was regarded as the battle ground whereon was to be fought the first conflict in the presidential year for protection this state was the precursor in the race shall american industries and american labor and american homes be protected this was the rallying cry all along the line the battle ended and such a victory on a fair vote and an honest count was seldom before witnessed in our state elections it took the place of an angry uprising of an indignant people they resolved to administer such a rebuke as should resound throughout the nation in defiant tones they roll back their answer our industries and property shall not be destroyed it was a contest of long wool versus free wool there are two shearings in that state one in the spring and one in the fall the june shearing was had with the yield referred to and the next will be in november with even more prolific results following the great victory the wasco sun a prominent democratic paper said there are no doubt many reasons that could be advanced showing why the democracy was defeated as they are defeated we do not propose to hold an inquest on the remains partly because there are no remains they were kicked by a mule we have been downed handsomely but we will be on hand when the next round is called there is no denying the fact that large republican gains are due to the effect of the mills bill and to us this result seems to measure the sentiment of the people on the question of the tariff and as might makes right in this case oregon can be set down as being opposed to a reduction of it and the defeated democrotic nominee for congress who ably canvassed the state also says i attribute our defeat principally to the platform adopted at the democratic state convention tie result of the election shows that oregon does not want free trade much twaddle has been indulged in by freetraders to divert attention from the significance of this result and every cause but the real one has been suggested for such a protest some gentlemen on this floor becoming so reckless as to charge that railroad influences and lumber trusts and money controlled the result in emphatic denial of such ingenious yet desperate alternatives i submit the plain issues on which the conflict was fought and then the candid acknowledgment of the democratic leaders in the state as to the real cause my state has neither lumber trusts nor political railroad jobbers either great or small and no election was ever more perfectly free from the corrupt use of monetary influences the true result must therefore be received unchallenged and as like effects are threatened by the mills bill upon similar and other industries in other states let this decisive victory point a moral let it be the ominous index reaching out to that great tribunal which shall sit in november to pass in judgment upon the issues now

with the preparation and presentation of the mills bill in that billr as it was originally prepared for the consideration of the ways and means committee it provided that all sugars below no 16 in color should be imported at the lowest rate of duty the effect of this provision would have been to stop the artificial and fraudulent coloring of sugar on the plantation and have given the mass of the people a marketable and far better sugar than they now buy for a much less price a sugar that would not have to be refined this was fully understood by the democrats on the ways and means committee for by interviews and through the papers they boasted of this feature of their bill but when the bill was reported to the house it had been changed so as to fix the low duties on sugar below no 13 in color as the present law provides and rendering it necessary that all the sugar imported should pass through the refineries before it was fit fbr use thereby prohibiting that monopoly the mills bill as originally drawn also prohibited the allowance of drawbacks on the exportation of refined sugars but i find in the bill reported to the house that that provision is strickep out i want to ask with all respect and with all earnestness and candor the chairman of the committee on ways and means and the membership of that committce what change came over the spirit of your dream that you struck these provisions out of your bill what revelation came to you to wartant you in making thesechangeschanges which drive all these sugars through the refineries increase their cost to the people nearly a cent a pound and do not increase the revenues to the government one cent that is a fair question it ought todemand a fair frank answer your bill was right in that respect so far as it went i hope it will he the pleasure of this house if they do not adopt my amendment to see to it that the low duty on sugar is made under no 16 rather than under no 13 now one further query why did that committee strike from this bill the provision prohibiting the payment of drawbacks upon sugar exported whatis the fact about it why sugar which has 100 per cent of saccharine matter instead of 96 brings a duty of 2 cents and 4 mills a pound the law says that upon being exported they shall have thedrawback of the duties paid less 1 per cent now what is tbe drawback fixed at two cents and six mills two cents and four mills per pound pay the duty on 100 per cent of saccharine matterwhen it comes in yet when it passes through the refinery and is exported they get a drawback of the duty paid and 2 mills a pound more well says somebody what is that for as i said before i give it up i do not know i tell you what the treasury experts say they say that there is no loss of saccharine matter in the refining of this sugar they reported that they were informed and so believe and i have the report here why is it that after you deduct the 1 per cent of the moneyduty paid they get 2 cents and 6

good pictures encourage the artistic talent that lies dormant i n a country thus giving occupation to numbers of people and by building up a native school they will tend to save our going to europe at all for our purchases as one of the early members of the students art league of new york i am somewhat familiar with the growth of these native schools originally the members of this society were the pupils of the yational academy but so intolerant were the officers of the latter institutionso bitterly opposed to the more progressive forms of art instructionthat the students rebelled and following the example of our forefathers set up independently today they are in a prosperous condition and the students art league is destined to assume a leading part in the artistic development of our country take however any young man or woman of this training school they are generally obliged to finish their course of instruction in europe because of the comparative scarcity of museums and good pictures here now this instruction which they receive in europe is given to them gratis and i know that i voice their sentiments when i request that a reciprocity should be shown by allowing the works of european artists to come in free i ask this not alone on the principle of common fairness but rather for the purpose of building up byincreasing the number of museums in america schools of instruction at home and thus making our art education cheaper for our poor boys as a nation we xix360 are rapidly developing building up great cities and seats of trade it becomes of paramount importance that our development should be on lines that will appeal to the taste of future generations this can only be accomplished by having the best examples always before our eyes the best pictures statuary and works

issue of december 25 you publish my letter written by me as an old illinois soldier a lifelong republican and a resident of las vegas for the past eight years in publishing my letter and in your editorial reply you insert several interrogation points and dispute the statements made by myself and other new mexico correspondents the impression created in my mind by your editorial is that if the statements made by the citizens of new mexico are true new mexico is entitled to statehood not being true she must be kept in a territorial condition until her citizens can tell the truth you say party reasons should cut no fifdre in admitting territories that is right butnew mexico is safely repubhican for time to come because her mining agricultural horticultural and manufacturing industries demand protection this is shown by her legislature for a number of years past her present legislature too is twothirds republican in both houses the republican party in the united states can not possibly object to the admission of new mexico on party grounds you say dakota does not urge her case because she has thousands of sioux indians within her borders whom she does not count but because she has over onehalf million of americans montana and washington do not include or base their claim upon their indian population but upon their american and white inhabitants it is not right that new mexico should enumerate her ignorant mongrel foreignspeaking greasers in order to qualify on a representative basis for admission in your issue of december 20 you say much time must elapse before this dense mass of spanishaztec aztec means the pueblo indian alien ignorance and superstition can be sufficiently infused with intelligence by the operation of immigration to entitle new mexico to such an honor to couple the weak stagnant mentally childish unproductive rubbish population with the enterprising energetic industrious and rapidlyincreasing population of the magnificent dakotas and make the admission of the latter dependent upon that of the wretched imbecile character of the former or to demand their admission at the same time is not only ridiculous but insulting new mexico does not count the wild or pueblo called aztec indians in her population they are not taxed and are by law prohibited from voting they never in one single instance attempted to exercise any of the rights of citizenship all statements to the contrary notwithstanding the population in 1880 not counting a single wild or pueblo indian was 119 565 the semidecennial census of 1885 shows a population of over 134 000 an increase of 15 000 in five years since 1885 the growth of population has far exceeded that of the five years preceding 1885 the increase has been principally farmers horticulturists miners capitalists and active business men generally from the new england middle and western states drawn here through the influence of the achteisn topeka and santa f6 railroadthe same class that have peopled the state of kansas they are largely the old soldier population and none are from the slums of europe such as aredumped bythe thousands in the northwest carefully prepared statistics just issued bythe territorial bureau of immigration place the population for 1889 at 204 040 an increase of 84 475 since 1880 as an illustration of the character of the increased population there were eleven hundred homestead preemption and other land entries made at the santa f6 land office during the last twelve months one single township within 20 miles of las vegas one year ago did not contain one land entry now it contains thirtysix entries by actual settlers this is but a sample of the actual settlements made by farmers throughout new mexico the days of range cattle here in new mexico are ending theest indications of the actual increase in population is shown by comparison of the vote east in 1886 and 1888 showing a net increase of 4 045 votes this will show the estimated population by the bureau of immigration for 1889 at 204 040 to be a conservative estimate an analysis of the census for 1885 shows the mexican population to be about 101 000 they polledaboutl9 000votes and are practically ata standstill with an american population of about 75 000 nearly onehalf the votes cast at the last election were castby americans from the east not byanaturalized european rabble element in almost onehalf the counties in new mexico the american vote predominates today with a rapid increase of american population there can be no doubt that the next united states census will show a majority of american voting population by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo with mexico in 1848 the admission of new mexico as a state was guarantied in 1850 a territorial government was given new mexico during general grants administration in 1874 a bill was passed by a republican congress to admit new mexico as a state by a twothirds vote in each house but failed to become a law for lack of agreement between the houses in the matter of detail in the process of admission in 187g the bill for the admission of new mexico passed the senate by a large majority but failed in the house for want of action california was admitted in 1850 with a population of 92 597 minnesota in 1858 with 120 000 oregon in 1859 with 50 000 kansas in 1861 with 107 000 nevada in 1804 with 40 000 nebraska in 1867 with 100 000 and colorado in 1876 with 100 000 new mexico with her population of 175 000 is as well equipped for selfgovernment as any people who now seek admission of the 75 000 american population the facts are that they are composed largely of the soldier elemnt reinforced by the young active progressive enterprising farmer horticulturist miner and capitalist who have come to till the soil develop the mines and add to the material wealth and prosperity of the territory the assessed valuation of new mexico is 43 151 920 not including railroad property amounting to over 30 000 000 this does not include fully 10 000 000 valuation of unadjudicated private landgrants that escape assessment by careful comparison with the assessed valuation and population of other territories seeking admission as shown by bradstreets report it is found the per capita valuation of wealth in new mexico is equal to that of the other territories the territorial census of 1885 also shows the rate of illiteracy was reduced 20 per cent the ratio of reduction since 1885 has been much greater this arises rom various causes in 1874 when the congress of theunited states by vote deemed new mexico worthy to be admitted to statehood she cast a little over 15 000 votes the population being almost entirely of mexican descent hence if new mexico is not entitled to statehood today it must be for the want of intelligence virtue and fitness for selfgovernment of her 75 000 american population who have immigrated into new mexico since that time in 1874 and 1876 there was not a single foot of railroad built within her borders the only means of communication was by bulltrains and the stagecoacb today there are over 1 300 milesof railroad in active operation with a number of wellbuilt active enterprising american cities built of brick stone and wood with wateringplaces healthresorts and hotels for size beauty and elegance of appointments equal to those of the large cities of the new

grows in georgia or alabama the attention of the american agriculturists and horticulturists is but just being called to the grand possibilities of new mexico only during the past three years with the introduction of improved agricultural implements and planting according to the seasons have the grand possibilities of new mexico been shown in the production of abundant crops of a superior quality

produced more feed and a better quality without irrigation than i did in iowa last winter i fattened 120 heud of steers ois onethird of the feed it required to fatten cattle in iowa the winter is

that during last year over 100 000 tons of iron were shipped from alabama and tennessee to the north some of it to boston some to pittsburgh some to philadelphia and much of it to the west the simple fact is that we have superior natural advantages for the manufacture of iron we can make more cheaply than anywhere else on this continent business men are finding it out and millions of dollars have gone from the north for investment in the south especially in alabama and tennessee some gentleman a moment ago asked whether we wanted any tariff at all that is not the issue nobody advocates free

stated that farm lands in the state of new york are continually shrinking in value that there are many more farms to rent than there are tenants because agriculture does not pay to some extent that is true of the south also why is it the answer is that this boasted american market which gentlemen iterate and reiterate is the best in the world is not sufficient for the farmers it never can be sufficient to take the grain and the provisions of the north and the west and the cotton of the south year after year we are shipping more and more cotton to foreign markets year after year more flour

about relying upon the home market protection was to furnish us and yet more and more every year have we been forced to rely upon the foreign market the farmers of the north and the farmers of the south are compelled to send their products abroad to compete with the products made by the pauper labor of the whole world and all the while we are paying high prices on everything that we consume it is this foreign market that regulates the prices of the wheatand the meats of the west for the merchant who ships abroad is bidding against the merchant who buys to sell at home it is the foreign
