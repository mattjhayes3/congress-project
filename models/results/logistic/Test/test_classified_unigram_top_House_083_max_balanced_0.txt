january in our politicsand i am using the word in its broadest sensewe have been floundering in a morass of inaction timidity and refusal to come to grips with the grave problems we face this is a far cry from 1952 when we were promised a great crusade piloted by the best brains which would have a ready solution for every problem it is an even further cry from december when the nation awaited the dynamic progressive legislative program which was to give us national security internal security peace and prosperity what we have received have been slogans as the solution to some problems and where no slogan could be quickly whipped up a refusal to recognize the problem early in the year when the hucksters could think of no effective program the administration flatly refused to admit we were having an unemployment problem while no slogan could be easily and quickly devised phrasemaking was resorted to in an attempt to delude the jobless that they were not out of work what was happening was a rolling readjustment whatever that may beand it was good for the country those of us who thought what was happening was a recession and who were fearful that if nothing were done we were heading into a depression were given the labels of political sadists and prophets of doom and gloom then as things became more serious the administration decided that the best way to lick the recession that really was not there was to try to talk prosperity so far as domestic prosperity was concerned the drillmasters in the generals administration seemed content with marching thousands of words up the hill and then marching them back down national security was one phase where we expected sound and solid policies the president had given 37 years of his life to the army his greatness came as a military leader in 1953 this administration cut 5 billion from the air force telling us that we would have more firepower with fewer airplanes by 1954 this mistake was admitted when the 5 billion was almost restored but they insisted on slicing the defense budget so they picked on the army this time against the recommendations of the chief of staff general ridgway who was selected by this administration in an illconceived move to make the professional military a tool of partisan politics now the pentagon is reappraising our military situation and we learn that the proposed cuts in the size of the army will not be carried out after all perhaps the budget bureau next year will pick out the navy to absorb cuts that cannot safely be applied until we are a great deal closer to the goal of world peace about the only place where we have strengthened the defense establishment was in the pentagon itself where we now have a whole flock of new assistant secretaries vice presidents is the term i believe chosen by secretary wilson the old general motors hand by which to identify them whether these new vice presidents will be effective weapons is somewhat doubtful at any rate the defense department team has given us some novel reading by reaching a goal of fewer air wings at a target date several years removed from the date selected by the truman administration we are supposed to be stronger just think how strong we would be today if our goal were cut back to say 50 wings and the year 2000 were selected to be the target date this administration has shied from the ugly words universal military training like a teenage girl shying away from a mouse it is proposing instead something it calls an expanded reserve everyone will be drafted given some training and put into the reserve the hucksters in this administration may be clever but they will find it hard to convince people that this proposal differs fundamentally from the hated umt this administration when it was seeking political favor particularly in the generals tour of the new york city industrial precincts promised that the full force of the federal government would be utilized to cushion economic declines the same promise has been made repeatedly since january 1953 i have already alluded to the inaction of the administration it makes certain claims to the builtin safeguards of its legislative program these center chiefly almost exclusively to the taxrevision bill a measure which provides for windfall benefits to a few coupon clippers but does nothing to increase the purchasing power of the farmer and the wage earner someone of the presidents hucksters sold him on the idea that taxation of income earned from dividends was double taxation this is a nasty word in fact most of us are just generally against it the only thing is that paying a tax on your dividends is not double taxation the administration knows this too if such taxes were really double taxation the administration would have recommended that all dividends be tax free it only said that some dividends would be tax free in the beginning with nice fat tax credits on the other dividends and maybe eventually we shall get around to making all of them tax free now if double taxation is bad and taxing dividends is double taxation why not make all of them tax free right now this feature of the tax bill according to the administration will encourage investment and provide for an expanding economy my own state of west virginia provides an excellent example of how much expansion this tax giveaway will encourage our governor has hired a team of experts to survey the economy and resources of the state their aim is to pinpoint the opportunities for expansion and diversification to take up the slack the christian science monitor discussed this survey in its issue of august 7 it indicated a number of business activities that could expand and diversify job opportunities but the monitor also said there was a lack of investment capital to accomplish this job and the monitor did not see any prospect of such investment capital becoming available now i should point out that the monitor is a rather conservative newspaper generally more republican than democratic the monitors discussion of our problem in west virginia was published sometime after the president had signed the tax bill into law the conservativeand factualmonitor failed to forsee any investment capital increase because of this tax bill people just do not put money in stocks and bonds or in bank accounts because of tax credits they invest money because they hope to earn money the average investor is a pretty prosaic fellow he only looks around to invest in a proposition when he feels sure the service or product involved will have a market so that it may be sold the administration takes the view that we should be satisfied with a second bestor even a third bestyear we need not break records according to secretary humphrey yet every year the labor force increases our economy must expand every year to absorb the new workers the philosophy of standing still or going back just a little bit is disastrous and foolhardy this administration has fumbled the foreigntrade policy as often and as consistently as it has fumbled all other legislation during the 1952 campaign the republicans came up with the slogan trade not aid it was misleading it appointed the randall commission which recommended a 3year extension of the reciprocal trade agree ment authority and suggested further tariff cuts now this was perfectly acceptable to the free traders like the fords and the charley tafts it was not acceptable to the high protectionists who wish to build a wall around the country so the administration compromised by accepting a straight 1year extension this made practically no one happy it certainly did not appeal to the moderates such as the representative of the third west virginia district those of us who take the moderate view want to encourage foreign trade all we can but we do not want to do so at the expense of our own vital industries there was no opportunity in the 1year extension nor in the presidents recommendations to correct inequities under existing practice nor to bring the administration of the law into line with the original intent of the congress the randall commission report would aid only big business but would harm little business we want both aided we would like to see a quota system adopted so that our own industries may have a fair share of the domestic market this is not inconsistent with the intent of the original reciprocal trade law which was designed to further employment and promised protection to small industry as well as to those industries vital to the united states west virginia coal miners are as anxious to win good will in venezuela and saudi arabia as any citizen but they see little advantage in going hungry themselves to do it west virginia potters and glass workers know it is imperative to build up the economy of japan to keep it from falling to the communists but little advantage is gained if they themselves are idle and hungry in the field of trade policy this administration has failed to appreciate the full significance of the problem which like most problems is not sharply etched in black and white it is colored with all shades of gray hence it has offered no solution which will encourage foreign trade but do so in a manner that does not ruin our own economy general eisenhower promised the farmers 100 percent of parity prices paid to farmers in the past 2 years have dropped 16 percent while consumer prices have risen to 114 wheat dropped 60 cents a bushel in 1953 but bread rose in price the lowering of supports on butter increased butter sales of april only 7 percent which amounted to about 2 290 000 but to the dairy farmer who took the price cut it meant a loss of 70 million in that 1 month the administration grasping for straws in an effort to save face is claiming a victory because congress voted a flexible pricesupport program of from 821 2 to 90 percent of parity congress has accepted the flexible principle according to the administration congress long ago accepted the flexible principle it is in the present law had congress not passed any legislation whatsoever price supports would automatically have dropped to the flexible 75percent floor in january the new law is not a victory for the administration but a defeat it is more than passing strange to see the white house claiming a victory by reducing supports to 82 2 percent when candidate eisenhower on october 4 1952 told an audience at brookings s dak and i quote the republican party is pledged to the sustaining of the 90percent parityprice support and it is pledged even more than that to helping the farmer obtain his full parity 100 percent parity with the guaranty in the price supports of 90 candidate eisenhower told the american federation of labor new york 1952 that he recognized in the tafthartley law certain provisions that could be used to break unions he promised repeal of these unionbusting provisions his tafthartley recommendations left the unionbusting provisions intact in fact strengthened many of them had it not been for united democratic action in the senate the bill passed probably would have left labor unions at the mercy of little tafthartleys in each of the 48 states many of them far more restrictive than the present law moreover the presidents national labor relations board through administrative decisions has further whittled away at labors few remaining protections veterans have suffered at the hands of this administration its penurious budget policies have created a peculiar climate an employee of the veterans administration now realizes that the measure of his efficiency is not how well he serves the veteran but how much money he saves a veteran is automatically on the defensive when he calls upon a va field office the veterans affairs committee ably directed by the gentlewoman from massachusetts who cooperated closely with the gentleman from texas brought out a bill offering mild costofliving increases to veterans and dependents compromises had already been made in the committee but the leadership demanded further cuts the result was that we enacted a bill which deprived millions of disabled veterans as well as all veterans of the spanishamerican war of any increases it resulted in the unprecedented action of the national tribune and stars and stripes a nonpartisan weekly newspaper devoting an entire page to criticism of republican leadership the national encampment of the veterans of foreign wars also took the unprecedented action of censuring the administration and the republican leadership the administrations welfare record is spotty whereas we passed legislation expanding the hospital construction program we curtailed funds for many health services including the vital mobile tuberculosis xray program the best the administration could come up with was a mild reinsurance program which was defeated social security was expanded but not enough a perfect example was the provision relating to permanent and total disability the administration bill provides that a man does not lose his equity if he becomes totally and permanently disabled thus if a 50yearold worker becomes totally and permanently disabled he may expect to receive his usual benefits when he becomes 65 he should receive disability benefits the president has endorsed the unemployment insurance program but called for and received inadequate legislation what was needed was legislation that would increase benefits and lengthen the duration to 26 weeks the president has endorsed an increase in the minimum wage but says it should not be done during a period of economic readjustmentrecession to us an increase in the minimum wage to as little as 1 per hour would pump a great deal of needed purchasing power into the economy when times are good the law of supply and demand for labor tends to take care of minimum wages the presidents position is very much akin to the chap who did not fix his leaky roof when it was raining it was too wet to work when it was not raining there was no need to fix it in the field of education a very sorry record is being made surveys conducted by the united states office of education and by the national education association show a need for 362 000 new classrooms these surveys also show that states and local governments do not have the ability to finance this construction the president and secretary hobby want to wait until 1956 when there will be a white house conference to find out a whether there is a school construction need and b whether federal aid is required if he would read reports from his own agencies he would have the answers to these questions president eisenhower who finds time in his schedule for golf fishing and stag dinners for the high wall street brass recently could not find time in his schedule to meet the group of educators who might have told him the facts of school life this administration has made a remarkable record in the giveaway field first it was the tidelands then it was the timber landswhich we in congress were alert enough to stopand now it is the synthetic liquid fuels program the minesafety program and our helium plants they gave up on soil conservation by ravishing the program and losing the skills of the men who were in it this was done when drought

i represent a consumer district in the city of new york but after studying this problem for many years it is my considered judgment and it is the considered judgment of the large majority of the democrats of the state of new york that we are in favor of continuing a high support price program for 1 more year now we do not take this action lightly but i know that the people of the city of new york and the people that i represent do not want to eat cheaper in order to bankrupt the farmers of this country because when they go bankrupt the city people are going to go bankrupt right after them they have learned that before the hard way in my opinion this administration lowsupport bill is a bill for the processors middlemen and for the big corporate farmers i cannot understand how in one breath you accept the principle of 75 percent of parity and in the next breath tell us that 90 percent is too high seventyfive percent will bankrupt the small farmers of this country and it will mean continued profits for the big corporate farmers and for the middlemen i have heard much talk from the administration leadership and from the republican side of the aisle about gradual readjustment downward of this parity support this is just like the talk we have been hearing for the last year from this republican administration about how healthy it is to have soft spots in our economy meaning unemployment in many industries and how good it is for the nation to enjoy a rollback or gradual readjustment which is their word for a recession the democratic party believes in full employment for our workers and fair prices for our farmers we will oppose the republican philosophy of the economics of scarcity which means another depression for america now let me tell you just why reducing supports and the farmers income does not benefit the consumer on april 1 in the state of new york as everywhere else in the nation dairy supports were dropped to 75 percent the dairy farmers in new york state today are getting a great deal less per hundredweight for their milk but the consumers in my district in new york city are paying the same price what has happened to the middle what has happened to the spread in our republican legislature in albany for the last 9 years a commission known as the lrwin commission has spent a million dollars studying this spread and later on in the reading of the bill i will read you some of the most meaningless conclusions that this commission has come up with we intend to raise the dairy support to 90 percent i do and i will offer an amendment

days or 2 weeks ago this nation in 54 cities undertook an airraid drill simulating atomic warfare and under the assumptions set forth for this airraid drill some 9 million americans were destroyed and 11 million wounded and this administration further assumed that as a result of that air raid the most important problem facing what was left of our country was the problem of the starvation of our people and we are talking about a surplus we ought to be setting up if we are worried about civil defense a stockpile of surplus in every area in every county outside every city of this nation let us

to 23 673 261 this is the top increase which i advocated in my testimony before the subcommittee studying this subject i am one of those who feels that the federal government should not be called upon to provide assistance to the states when the states are able to provide such help for themselves whether in the field of education or otherwise i believe that every state should do everything it can for its people before asking for or expecting federal aid even after our states have done that in many instances i doubt the advisability of federal aid for a number of reasons however federal assistance in this field is now a recognized necessity i hope that some day our states will be able to carry this program on without federal assistance although i doubt that such will be the case for many years i have voted against many increases sought in amendments from the floor on appropriation bills i believe we must rely to a great extent upon the recommendations of our committees i have repeatedly voted to bring about economy in our governmental operations but this is a field in which i believe we cannot afford to be pennywise and poundfoolish we must not engage in false economy we already know what vocational education has meant to thousands upon thousands of boys and girls who cannot afford a college education i was very much disturbed when i learned that this year the administration had again recommended a severe cut in the federal appropriation for vocational education while the cut of 1 173 260 proposed was not as large as the proposed cut last year it was nevertheless serious my personal observation of the vocational education program in my own state after seeing these programs in action and during my experience of three terms on the north carolina state senate has convinced me that this program merits federal support i sincerely believe that the moneys which have been allocated to north carolina from appropriations for vocational education have been wisely and economically spent i know of no program with federal aid which has made greater progress and which is doing more for the building of a better north carolina and a better america than the vocational education program these appropriations have enabled many boys and girls to learn to earn a livelihood and thereby boost our state and national income college preparatory secondary education has proved to be insufficient to cope with pupils of all intellectual levels consequently one of the most vital phases of our public educational program is that of vocational education especially when more than 6 million pupils are enrolled in our nations public high schools i understand that highschool enrollment has doubled and then redoubled during the years following the passage of the smithhughes act vocational education is rapidly becoming more and more important and its need is becoming more and more intensified because of our changing pattern of occupational employment the states need encouragement in this field i think all of us appreciate also the importance of vocational education to our national defense program it looks as though we will always need a standby supply of skilled workers consequently while the states are and should continue to assume the larger burden and cost of vocational education it has a national aspect and a national impact which should not be overlooked the main point of contention last year and i suspect again this year is whether or not this program should continue to receive federal aid certainly most of us are in agreement that vocational education is an effective and an important program which should be continued if we believe in the program and if we believe it is deserving of federal assistance then we should not hesitate to provide adequate appropriations if congress is opposed to federal assistance then it should reverse its policy however i do not think a worthwhile program should be destroyed by indirection in the form of such severe appropriation cuts that its effectiveness will be destroyed i know it must have been a struggle for the early leaders in the states to get these programs started some 35 years ago i also feel sure had it not been for federal grants which encouraged the states the beginning would have long been delayed all of those persons in the states who have had any part in the operation of this program or who helped to provide the state and local support are so accustomed to thinking of this program as a partnership affair between the states and the federal government that i fear the program would suffer if federal support were now weakened in the least particularly when the facts tend to justify greater help in fact it appears to me that the need for further expansion of this program may be greater today than it ever has been at any time in our school history while vocational education was not specifically mentioned in the presidents budget message it was implied that federal support for this program should be discontinued by 1955 or 1956 i now feel confident that this would be a serious mistake unless there is an almost miraculous change in the present picture and the financial ability of the states in many respects all of the subjects which are included in this great program are so involved by their contributions to the national economy and the general welfare of this nation that they are entitled to federal support agriculture for example in many respects is the basis of our national economy control of production of agricultural products is geared to protect the national welfare in emergencies where more food and fiber is needed all farm agencies respond to the national leadership when requests are made at other times when surpluses are excessive to the point that reasonable values are threatened acreage controls are suggested and again the farm agencies respond vocational agriculture always participates in these emergencies there is federal support of all other farm agencies i do not question that support i am for it but i do contend that since vocational agriculture is so actively engaged in an organized educational program which involves inschool farm boys young adult farmers and adult farmers that this program is equally eligible to receive federal support the training for the skilled trades affects the skilled worker who either in peacetime or national emergency is indispensable to the national welfare the productive capacity of our industries was a decisive factor in our winning world war ii the training resulting directly and indirectly from programs made possible by the smithhughes and georgebarden acts had much to do with making that production possible we must not forget that many large industries are interstate in character and that skilled workers migrate this program which has many implications for national concern must be kept strong it needs much further development and the support which results from federal aid there should not be any question raised about homemaking education the future citizens of this nation will be a reflection on the kind of homes we have today the only organized training educational program designed specifically to train homemakers is the program of vocational home economics because of the direct influence on the national character of our citizenship this program needs continued federal support in discussing the distributive education program i want to attempt to make two points one is that lack of interest and federal support by congress affects adversely the state support and the other point is that distributive education also deserves federal support in support of my contention that lack of federal interest and support weakens state support i am told that a national survey revealed that in a great many states the legislature did not make up the loss caused by the federal cut in distribution and the programs were curtailed in north carolina during the 1953 year the state operated its distributive education program with 23 000 less money than it used during 1952 it was necessary to shift some of the customary state support to the local communities and to reduce the number of teachers employed during the year1954there is available only 15 000 more for this program than was available 4 years ago the increase for this program during the 4year period was only 15 percent while the average for the other three programs was 35 percent there is no doubt but that the state was influenced by the national action congress in good faith endorsed distributive education by authorizing an appropriation for it when the georgebarden act was passed in 1946 when we stop to analyze the importance of effective distribution to our economy it is difficult to understand why there is any question raised about the inclusion on an equal rank with the other vocational subjects the training for jobs in distributive occupations mass production for example so important to this nation is not possible without effective distribution selling like all other types of jobs has been affected by technology and the salesman to be effective must be trained the men who manage any business involving distribution along with the public it serves want well trained personnel training increases the salesmans effectiveness he and the business earn more and the public is better served this type of situation duplicated all over the nation affects favorably our national economy boys and girls who desire training for distributive occupations are just as deserving as are those who plan their careers for other vocations training for those should not be denied by the 1 173 260 federal cut proposed originally north carolina would have lost from its state allotment 53 497 to many this may seem to be a small cut but this 53 497 affects the employment of 20 teachers the north carolina general assembly has already made its appropriation for the 195455 budget and will not meet again before the 195455 fiscal year begins there was very little provided for extension of services in addition to the fact that no new teachers could be employed regular salary increments for teachers would be jeopardized i believe that adequate federal support of these programs is about the finest investment made in north carolina in the field of education i feel sure that such is also the case in most other states federal investment in this essential program has brought and in my humble opinion will continue to bring returns or dividends far in excess of the monetary amount of the investment because of my deep convictions about this program i am therefore happy to support the increase provided by the proposed amendment of the gentleman from virginia it will make possible additional teachers which are so badly needed in north carolina i therefore urge this committee to give its most serious consideration to this

misinformation and exaggerations invariably generated by this topic i would like to lay before my colleagues for their calm consideration some of the facts related to this issuefacts vital to its determination so there may be no question as to mymotives let me say that i represent the 18th congressional district of california within the limits of that district lies the city of long beach my home this city presently has hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in the action of this body respecting the submerged lands its future stake can best be illustrated by stating that at the present time untapped oil resour~es in the submerged lands within the citys boundaries are estimated at four times the present assessed valuation of the entire city so both as a citizen of long beach and as its representative in congress i have a definite anl close interest in the controversy however as an american citizen in common with each and every other of my fellow americans i have an even more particular and vital interest in it namely is my national government to continue in the historic american tradition of functioning as a government of delegated powers reserving and preserving to the state and local governments all those functions which adequately can be discharged at these levels closer and more responsive to the will of the people or are we to propel ourselves down the road of centralization of powers in a few handshands very remote from our citizens this road traveled by other nations has led to deprivation of individual liberty slavery to an allpowerful state dictatorship desperation and despair for in truth and in fact the submerged lands controversy stripped to its essence and bared of extraneous and irrelevant attributes sought to be attached to itto confuse and sugar coat itis no more than another attempt by the advocates of big powerful allconsuming centralized federal government to move toward that tragic goal i truly believe that many wellmeaning people have been taken in and duped by the biggovernment advocates it is my purpose to state the issue in its true perspective now while the atmosphere still is clear and unturbulent i shall explain the background of the controversy and answer some of the false charges and misleading propaganda that advocatesof federal control of the submerged lands have spread here are the facts back of this controversy the colonial charters of what later became the thirteen original states granted those colonies not only the land and the waters thereon but also the sea for a distance ranging from 3 miles to 20 leagues about 60 miles when these colonies formed the united states of america their seaward boundaries became fixed at 3 miles later as new states were created out of the wild lands of the west they were admitted into the union on an equal footingin all respectswith the original states the seaward boundaries of coastal states were fixed at the 3mile limit except in the case of texas and the west coast of florida where the seaward boundary was 3 marine leagues or about 101 2 miles the unsettled territory of most of these states however was recognized as federal and became the public domain over which the states had jurisdictional sovereignty but not title it is important to remember this point namely there has never been a question that actual legal title to lands regarded as within the public domain rests in the federal government and that such title was derived directly from the british sovereign on the declaration of our independence the federal government did not specifically lay claim to the navigable streams and lakes the harbors and the tidelands and ocean outside the 3mile limit it is important to remember these additional points first the title to these was generally recognized as belonging to the states as derived from the british sovereign second this title was subject only to the regulation of navigation by the federal government a power also derived from the previous sovereign instances have occurred in the past where claim was made that these submerged lands were a part of the public domain and therefore belonged to the federal government however no less than 52 decisions of the united states supreme court dating as far back as 1844 have involved state ownership of filled lands made from tidal swamps and shallow water along the coasteach and every one of these decisions upheld ownership in these lands by the states that is the way things stood in 1936 oil had been discovered some years before under the submerged lands of southern california it was being produced in everincreasing quantities under leases from the state these leases under the carefully drawn model resource conservation statutes of the state of california provided a high royalty return to the people of california some individuals and companies failing to get state leases and well aware of the much reduced 121 2 percent royalty provisions of oil leases issued by the federal government had made application for federal leases on the basis that the submerged lands were owned by the federal government in every case their applications were rejected mr harold ickes then secretary of the interior ruled in 1933 that such claims must be rejected he cited one of these 52 united states supreme court decisions stating such title to the shore and lands under water is regarded as incidental to the sovereignty of the states and cannot be retained or granted out to individuals by the united states suddenly in 1936 however mr ickes changed his mind on january 16 of that year a mr c a weigel filed an application for a federal oil lease on an underwater oil field located at huntington beach calif which was already operating under the state lease mr ickes reversed the longsettled policy of the interior department and allowed this and other subsequent applications to stand open in his files why did mr ickes change his mind why did he suddenly choose to ignore these 52 united states supreme court decisions his only answer was that he had made a mistake when he ruled that the states held title to these lands of course when mr ickes change of mind was announced applications for other federal leases to tidelands began to pour in none of these lease applications was granted but mr ickes began urging legislative or judicial action to declare the oilbearing submerged lands to be federal property in april 1937 a bill was introduced in the senate for this purpose a similar senate joint resolution passed the senate that year and was reported out by the house judiciary committee in 1938 however it died with the end of the 75th congress similar legislation was introduced in the 76th congress in 1939 by this time the people of the coastal states had become awakened to the fact that more than oil under the submerged lands was involved they recognized that such legislation would cloud the titles to all filled lands and their improvements along the coasts the inland lakes and the navigable streams of any state as a consequence legislation was introduced not to fix title in the federal government but to affirm titles of submerged coastal lands and inland navigable waterways to the states such legislation gained momentum in each following congress it had the backing of the attorneys general of 46 states this legislation finally passed both houses of congress in 1946 but was vetoed by mr truman however while this stateownership legislatiqn was pending before the congressand it had a good chance of passagethe federalcontrol advocates succeeded in getting the department of justice to step in and prop up mr ickes claims in 1945 former attorney general biddle caused a suit to be filed in the federal district court of southern california against an oil company operating off the californiacoast under state lease claiming the lands on behalf of the federal government this suit was later dropped and a new suit was initiated against the state of california and carried directly to the united states supreme court this new suit claimed that all persons who held title or leases from the state of california on submerged lands were trespassers against the rights of the united states the supreme courts decision in the california tidelands case handed down on june 23 1947 was a most astonishing one in a 6 to 2 opinion the court ruleddespite 52 precedentsthat the question of ownership of the submerged coastal lands out to the 3mile limit had never been previously settled and that california did not own there lands the decision did not say however that thefederal government owned the sub merged lands but that because of the needs for national defense it had paramount rights and dominion over them the ruling left the door open for congress to decide the actual ownership similar original united states supreme court suits were immediatelybrought against texas and louisiana where development of oil and gas under state leases had already begun beneathi the shadow waters of the gulf of mexico both within the state boundaries and in the continental shelf beyond the texas and louisiana decisions were handed down in 1950 and were similar to the california decision the production of oil and gas off the california coast has continued under a series of stipulations between the state and federal governments the proceeds being impounded until the question of ownership is settled but the texas and louisiana decisions completely stopped the further development of oil and gas deposits off those coasts at a time when the oil was badly needed for domestic and defense purposes the 82d congress saw a rash of tidelands legislationsome for federal ownership some for state ownership and some to allow interim oil and ga development pending final settlement of the ownrship this house in july 1951 passed by 265 to 109 a bill to confirm and establish state titles to submerged lands within the states historic boundaries and to confirm federal ownership off the continental shelf with federal leasing of its oil deposits the senate in 1952 passed with a much smaller majority a bill establishing the states title to the submerged lands within their boundaries but not touching on the ownership of the continental shelf the house accepted this bill but again mr truman vetoed it tidelands bills of all sorts have been introduced during this 83d congress a bill known as the graham bill has been carefully drafted by the judiciary committee it meticulously protects the proper provinces of the federal government while confirming the ownership of the states in these submarginal lands i hope my colleagues will swiftly make it law before leaving the historical background phases of the controversy however i must point out that the doctrine of federal paramount rights and do minion enunciated in the supreme courts california tidelands decision has implications far beyond control of the submerged lands and the valuable oil deposits under thei if the federal government because of the needs of national defense can claim the submerged coastal lands on these grounds it could on the same basis expropriate any other lands or natural resources within our country this is a dangerous concept and will not be remedied by stateownership legislation it will and must be our constant duty to insure that the doctrine is never perverted to the derogation of our liberties now i would like to turn to a few of the many false charges and the misleading propaganda spread by the advo cates of federal ownership and analyze them with you to determine their merit take for instance the charge that the oil lobby is behind the drive for state ownership of submerged lands let us see what the true fact is the true fact is that the socalled oil lobby has supported not state ownership but has supported the very legisla tion sought by the truman administration to establish federal control in testimony before the senate interior and insular affairs committee during the 1951 submergedlands hearings oilindustry representatives endorsed the omahoneyanderson bill providing for permanent federal control mr tru man urged the passage of this measure in his veto message on the holland bill in 1952 the drive for stiteownership legislation has come from the states them selves and their political subdivisibnsnot from any oil lobby since 1938 a total of 205 state and local officials have gone on record with the committees of congress urging passage of the stateownership legislation included in these endorsers of state ownership were 45 individual governors and 74 different state attorneys general major support for state ownership has come from a great many respected national organizations such as the natfonal associatfon of attorneys general the american bar association the american association of port authorities and the american municipal association which represents 10 150 municipalities throughout our land now take a look at another false chargethat the word tidelands has been used by statepwnership advocates to deceive the people the truth is that state and local representatives have never claimed that tidelands in the strict sensethat is the part of the seashore washed by the ebb and flow ofthe tideis involved the states representatives properly described the issue as affecting submerged lands newspaper practice of using labels for issues has resulted in the common reference of the submergedlands dispute as the tidelands matter this approach by federalcontrol advocates simply demonstrates and exemplifies the ingenuity of their efforts to confuse this issue in the minds of the american people next let us see what the truth is of the false charge by federalcontrol advocates that the supreme court has never held that the states own these lands the truth is that state ownership of the submerged lands was affirmed by the supreme court of the united states 52 times and by the lowei<federal and state courts 244 times prior to the astounding decision in the california case even in that decision the supreme court admitted that many times it used language strong enough to indicate that it then believed the states not only owned tidelands and the soil under inland navigable waters but also owned soil under all navigable waters within their territorial jurisdiction whether inland or not even secretary of the interior harold ickes in 1933 stated that settled law was as follows title to the soil underneath the ocean within the 3mile limit is in the state of california and the land may not be appropriated except by the authority of the state my colleagues it was only after oil was discovered in large quantities that the federal government changed its position and tried to confiscate these lands again advocates of federal ownership have attempted to lull the american people into a false feeling of security by spreading the misconception that the title of the states to lands beneath inland navigable waters is not endangered by the federalownership doctrine the contrary is true the very brief filed by the federal government in the suit against california attacked as unsound and erroneous the rule that states owned the lands beneath their inland navigable waterways in the california decision the court itself said california had only a qualified ownership of such lands further the supreme court has held that the greatolakesare open seas governed by the same rules of law as lands under tidewaters on the borders of the sea federal officials may promise that they would never attempt to confiscate lands beneath inland navigable waterways but the supreme court has ruled that such acts cannot bind the federal government what credence can be given such promises boldly made at the very time the federal government completely reversed its position on state ownership to take away the coastal submerged lands of the states next i want to examine for you the argument that the federal government must take over this oil for national de fense let us remember that this gov ernment of ours is a government of the people by the people and for the people and that not only is the sanctity of the individual guaranteed by the constitutiori but also tha sanctity of his rights to his property it is a revolutionary doctrine to say that the federal government can confiscate resources necessary to national defense the constitution permits the federal govexnment to condemn the property it needs but requires that just compensation be paid the owner the wisdom of the founding fathers did not give it the power to con fiscate state or privately owned property for any purpose the claim that this oil will be available for national defense only if the federal government owns it is pure and simple nonsense it has been under state ownership and control that the oil was discovered developed and made available to the people and the government of our land i challenge anyone to show me one single instance where one single barrel of oil has been denied the federal government from the submerged lands but if that not be enough to dispel any belief that the federal government must take this oil for national defense let me say this that in june 1952 in the senate judiciary committee hearings the interior department and the general services administration even stated that they planned to declare these submerged lands surplus to the needs of any federal agencies just prior to his election president eisenhower in october 1952 stated that state ownership would in no way interfere with the national defense needs and i call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have so profusely spread their admiration and support for the president of the united states of america in the pages of the congressional record to match their words with deeds and heed our presidents recommendations and desires with respect to this very important issue next what is there to the charge that only three selfish states are involved in this submerged lands controversy it is plainly and simply another attempt to obscure the true facts that all 48 states are involved it is true that only three states california texas and louisiana have been sued but the interior department has attempted to seize the coastal submerged lands in washington mississippi alabama and floridawithout even suing them further mr trumans executive order allegedly creating a naval petroleum reserveif it has any legal force or effect whatsoeverapplies to the submerged lands of all 21 coastal states not just california texas and louisiana the strange and dangerous doctrine of paramount rights by which the federal government has attempted to seize these submerged lands is so revolutionary and so farreaching that the sovereignty and the property rights of all 48 states are threatened even the constitutional protection guaranteed to private property is endangered all natural resources everywhere bould be nationalized under this doctrine and my colleagues those are not my words they are the words of the resolutions of the american bar association and of the national association of attorneys general of the 48 states of the united states of america i do not wish to hold this floor indefinitely to answer the endless baseless charges of the federalcontrol advocates however there are three additional specific charges that should be explained in order fully to clear the air for deliberation on the graham bill there is a charge that the states are trying to steal these lands and that to restore them would be a gift nothing could be further from the facts the supreme court itself in the california case specifically pointed out that congress has the constitutional power and right to restore unquestioned state ownership to these lands the states are scrupulously adhering to constitutional procedures by petitioning the congress to restore their rights to describe such proper legal procedure as a steal undermines respect for our legal system obviously that false charge is calculated to arouse emotions and confuse the true issue from their inception the states have without challenge owned used and improved these lands until the very recent past to restore that ownership can by no stretch of the imagination be called either a gift or a steal a more appropriate word would be justice federal ownership advocates have gone so far afield as to try to involve the question of education in the submerged lands issue they tell us that federal control is necessary to provide oil for education the truth is that neither the federal government the state governments or the local governments have the constitutional power to confiscate anything for any purpose however worthy that is one of the fundamental protections written into the constitution on which our system of government is based furthermore any revenues that would be available for education would be of such an infinitesimal amount as to make this argument ridiculous in the extreme last month the library of congress reported that if all revenues from the submerged lands oil became available for educationevery penny of themit would amount to less than onehalf of one percent of present educational expenditures those advocating oil for education have raised false hopes on the part of educators in order to gain their powerful support for federal control actually oil for education has nothing whatsoever to do with the basic issueownership of submerged landsand is at best a shimmering illusion i hope that this explanation of the background of the submerged lands controversy and this exposure of some of the false and misleading charges and propaganda that it has generated will serve to resolve the issue in the minds of some who may be coming to grips with it for the first time i hope all will realize that this issue is not one between republicans and democrats nor is it one between a few states favored in their natural resources and the remainder of the states of our land nor is it one involving the education of our children i hope all will realize that stripped to its fundamentals it is a contest between those who believe in preserving state local and private rights by limiting the powers of federal government and those who would give the federal government unlimited power over the people and the resources of the nation"], [0.9644345045089722, 0.9644345045089722, 0,

theodore roosevelt who had awakened the nation to the problem of conservation as both an american and a republican i intend to stay awake president eisenhower goes on to say this calls for a strong federal program in the field of resources development if ever in our history it has been important to exercise judicious wisdom with respect to our nationally owned natural resources that time is now this refers with particular force to oil oil is one of the most strategic substances in the political economy of our times large quantities of oil are needed for the military and economic buildup of the free world in the event of allout war oil could spell the difference between victory and defeat oil may be essential for our survival these considerations make the world distribution of known oil deposits a key factor in our national as well as our international planning the most important of these deposits are in the united states and the caribbeangulf of mexico area the persian gulf and

inaugurated president but i also know that at one of his press conferences the president said he was opposed to the dropping of any revenue until there was other revenue to replace it if this is the case i am wondering what is to replace the millions of dollars the federal government is now receiving if this revenue goes to the coastal states estimates of what this oil and other submerged resources are worth range from 40 billion to 250 billion almost the size of our national debt why then should we not use this money for the purpose of making some payment on our national debt such allocation of the royalties from these resources could well get us off to a good start in establishing a debt retirement program or perhaps wisdom might dictate that this source of revenue should go into the federal treasury for general purpose of government but it should not be given away for nothing i do not think that the great architects of our constitution ever intended that the provision

they abetted the sale of it by being purchasers no bootlegger could make a sale of a single pint of liquor unless there wasa buyer applying this reasoning to communism it will no doubt follow that people who never thought of being a communist will want to venture into it because there is a ban against it i think the senate and the whole congress do not understand the background of communism communism springs from want and dire distress and it is embraced by many as the only light they see to relieve them of this distress in the united states if we make the declaration of independence mean what it says that particular ism will not gain much headway i am speaking from experience in the dark depression days in north dakota when foreclosures and dispossession were rampant and whole families were being ejected out on the highways because they were helpless when wheat was selling for 26 cents per bushel and good steers selling for less than 2 cents per pound and the purchasing power of the farmers had disappeared men who were caught in this dilemma and had families to support would embrace any kind of an ism that they thought might relieve them from this dire need want and suffering in that period the communists had a state ticket in the field and attracted many good people to it when times changed and the buying power was put back in the farm belt when foreclosures and dispossessions ceased and the farmersand through them every business concern in the stateregained their purchasing power the communist tickets disappeared entirely my record is absolutely against communism as many people know but i am of the firm opinion that you cannot change mens minds under given circumstances by any act of congress if this law is enacted by congress it will make the work

a prosecution will be begun if that amendment is finally contained in the bill it will be perfectly useless because that is the law today just what the purpose of this bill is with this amendment in

introduced and has reported significant improvements which will not in any way jeopardize the financial stability of the retirement fund the following improvements will help to correct weaknesses and inequities which have occurred first provides benefits to widows dependent widowers and dependent parents at age 60 instead of age 65 second provides benefits for widowed mothers with physically or mentally disabled children over 18 years of age third provides full survivor benefits to widows dependent widowers and dependent parents who are also eligible for a railroadretirement annuity in their own right fourth increases the creditable compensation from the present maximum of 300 a month to a maximum of 350 in calculating the retirement or survivor annuity fifth disregards compensation earned after age 65 if the crediting of such compensation would lower the annuity sixth changes the disability work clause to a maximum of 100 in earnings for any month without loss of the annuity for that month while the tax base is increased from 300 to 350 a month the tax rate of 61 4 percent is left unchanged the bill also includes necessary increases in unemployment insurance benefits by raising the daily benefit rates by 50 cents a step with a maximum daily rate of 8 50 as i have said this bill will not make all of the improvements which might be made without weakening the fund but it does make those changes which are needed now to correct hardships arising under the present law the committee has wisely provided that the financing provisions of the bill are adequate to meet the costs of the additional benefits provided by it in this way we can assure every railroad worker that his investment in the retirement system is sound and that the changes made actually strengthen rather than weaken the fund todays workers must be guaranteed that their future benefits are protected we all know that rising costs have had a serious impact on the retired worker a realistic program of security in retirement demands that we constantly reexamine the program to be sure that it provides a decent standard of living for the men who built and who operate the worlds greatest transportation system and their survivors h r 7840 is a step in the right direction and i hope that we can follow it in the next congress with other improvements based on the studies made by the joint committee on railroad retirement legislation"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0004528164863586426, 0.5004528164863586, 0, "i ask for a vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york and then j1

can help them transform siberia a rich and beautiful land from one of tears exile misery and death into a happy and wealthy country second that it be made known to the people of the mainland of china that we stand ready to help them avoid destruction from floods famine and disease dams and power installations can be built food can become plentiful and medicines available red regimes block both solutions for years it seems a conspiracy has existed to keep america out of the pacific today the reds in the kremlin deny access to siberia the reds in peiping deny access to mainland china thus twin conspiracies operate against us in the pacific while our military posture is firming up in the pacific one check point must not be overlooked an appeal over the head of the despots to the people of mainland china and of russia assuring noncommunists they will not be chased down a blind alley to their destruction in world war ii it was felt that our unconditional surrender terms prolonged the resistance of the people of germany and japan against the allies unconditional surrender appeared to work against the basic instincts of self preservation unconditional surrender became a weapon in the hands of the dictators enabling them to threaten their people with fight or die at wonson above the 38th parallel in north korea when our troops moved in they found the people had fled to the mountains after several days when word reached the civilians that our troops would not cut their ears off that our troops were men of good will the koreans streamed down out of the hills back to their homes red propagandists had portrayed us as cruel and vicious the oriental fears corporal punishment and expects no help from as if he is now behind the iron curtain under communist domination thus it appears to me in conjunction with our military posture in the pacific we must reach over the heads of the kremlinites and the reds in china to the hearts and minds of the people of russia and mainland china we might well let them know specifically what we hope for in addition to becoming free from threats of body harm we must it seems to me for maximum hope and effort offer them weapons to wave in the face of their red overlords demanding specific performance performance in the name of freedom here in our recent election armed with a theme our people acted they kept hammering at the casualties in korea over 100 000 of them with no end of the war in sight the new adxcix 111 iinistration has a mandate to do something positive about korea armed with a theme like the proposition to help develop the richness of siberia and to help eliminate the devastations of mainland china i believe the people of china and of russia will be in a better position to help us dissolve the twin conspiracies that militate against the united states in the pacific today certainly your task in this sense will be made easier i suggest that appropriate committees in the congress by joint resolution if need be affirm specific hope of assistance to the unfortunate people of russia and of china to the end that they will be freed from tyranny and oppression with benefits on the horizon hitherto denied them in
