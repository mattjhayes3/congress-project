call attention to these because by their records you shall know them you shall be judged of tomorrow by the works of today or else all the rules of logic and experience are broken down and perverted and there are no longer any marks along the highway of human conduct to guide us in the right way ilow was it in the fortysixth congress with apportionment you were charged with apportioning representation among the people of the states what did you do because this side of the house refused to permit you to give to one man who had fought four years against his country three times the political power in controlling the legislation and administration of the country that is wielded by a man who fought as many years in the countrys defense you permitted that congress to adjourn without making the apportionment what did the republicans do when they came back in the fortyseventh congress at once they addressed themselves to the effort of completing a work which you had attempted but abandoned because we insisted that it should be finished with reference to justice to all sections we simply sought to know what was right and just in that behalf so just and so creditable was that apportionment that it commended itself even to your favor and passed without delay or serious opposition what else now you are solicitous apparently about the working people of this country you are solicitous about the currency of this country which so immediately affects their interests the bank charters were expiring and some legislation was indispensable to prevent financial disturbance and a panic did you meet the public requirements and just expectation you did not why because you represent the topmost upperten and the thoroughly and absolutely lowermillion the bottom of the basin and the brim the yeomanry of the country the healthful stratum of active earnest middle life you were not actively concerned about what did you do did you touch that question though you knew neglect would be followed by contraction and disturbing conditions that would again paralyze all our industries you did absolutely nothing shirked your duty dodged the responsibility why because you were guided by a rule of action that does not seek merely to do what is right but searches for mere expedients you were afraid to take action in regard to the bank charters what else there was the geneva award you remember that when england through her sympathetic action if not by her positive efforts assisted in the attempt to destroy the young republic we said to our mother country if it ever occurs that this nation can stagger to her feet she will hold you to an account for this and so she did and into our treasury england paid over 15 000 000 to repair the damage her cruisers had done our commerce there it was in the national treasury you had been appealed to time and time again to proving for its distribution why did you not do it because two conflictine interests came in here and unwilling to serve one without both you fell between the two stools and left the duty unperformed it came over to the fortyseventh congress and asking no question except what is right and just and believing that what is right and just is always expedient we addressed ourselves to the work of providing for the distribution of that fund our action was satisfactory to the country what else here was the mormon question the civilized world was protesting against that monstrosity that twin relic of barbarism you listened to the prayers of the evangelical associations of this country you denounced from month to month the evil but there in your midst sat elder cannon backed and supported by the influence of four healthy vigorous wives and his flown was sufficient to prevent any attempt by you to strike polygamy the question came before the fortyseventh congress a republican congress and in less than ninety days that evil was put under the ban of the law our industries you champion them you can not find a page upon the statutebook from 1798 to this hour where by democratic votes our industries were even upheld or for a moment encouraged and yet the democratic party poses as a defender and champion of all these i call attention to them because the whole country is interested in them because in the language of my friend from west virginia they are economic questions what of our finances today there is too much reason to apprehend that your anxiety is to do that which will catch votes rather than to do that which will tend in the future to build up the honor and credit of your country and secure its permanent prosperity by the adoption and maintenance of a currency which shall be a fixed and unvarying measure of values whether of one or both the metals now only one word more and i have done and will yield the floor to my friends my brother from west virginia suggested that we should discuss economic questions and refrain from that which savors of partisan debate what are economic questions what profits it to us who represent the two hundred and fifty thousand mills shops and factories of the country that we with our voices and with the votes of freemen uphold them if those who have no industries in common with us and are opposed to the system by which alone ours can be protectedwhat good i repeat does it do us to stand about those industries and defend them if one vote in one section of the country cast to strike them down is worth three votes in our section to uphold them is an effort here and elsewhere to correct that inequality an economic questionor not are we to bemere lickspittles who can consent simply consent to stay and breathe gods air without asserting our manhood i insist and it is all i claim that a citizen of ohio or indiana or illinois shall have as much right tobe heard on this floor by his ballot and that his ballot shall be as potent to influence legislation as that of any other man in any other section of this country and since this question has to do with economic effects and the rights and wellbeing of all our people it is i submit a very economic question and i refer to it because and only because it comes to our very hearthstones i shall be glad and rejoice when we shall all turn our eyes toward the morning in speaking of this great question one of my democratic friends said to me by way of chiding i tira my face toward the morning i replied yes yesterday morning we do indeed turn to yesterday to learn the lesson which should guide us in the labor of tomorrow i shall be glad when the intelligence and the property which is the outgrowth of industry and care when the thinking men of the south who want that section strong in the right and prosperous in all its border realizing that their great interests and just ambitions go hand in hand with those of the same class of men in other sections shall join in a united effort for the general good of all parts of our common country i shall be glad gentlemen when the waters in your rivers shall not run as now unvexed to the sea hut when all those streams shall turn the wheels of a thousand busy industries when your mines shall awaken at the touch of quickened industry and your coal fields shall be the scene of active enterprise and you shall rejoice in a prosperity that shall find expression in lifting all men up by enlarging their opportunities and preparing them for a more intelligent discharge of private and public duties i agree that the democratic party is indeed a great leveler but unfortunately your manner of leveling is to drag men down ours to lift men up you in many sections are accustomed to make the poor wretch satisfied with his lot not by pointing him to possibilities above but to a more wretched condition below that is what made democracy strong in the north true manhood was not exacted intelligence was not demanded of them it was only required that they should do the bidding of a great oligarchy and vote the democratic ticket you say well democratic brethren are pretty numerous so they are for the reasons just mentioned it is easier to be a democrat than it is to be a republican one only has to lie still in the boat and float he does not have to pull an oar in the current of thought or lift a hand in the field of moral reform that is the great difference between the two parties the motto of the republican party is upward and onward and now in conclusion i ask you gentlemen on the other side to point me to any act of yours in the whole history of the past fifty years of which you are justly proud and which was of your conception or the result of your handiwork why if i did not want to be absolutely and thoroughly amiable i might cite all the great events of the last halfcentury in support of my argument i search in vain to find an industry that would be safer in your keeping i have asked with earnestness my fellowcitizens in each campaign how it could be possible that the industries of this country could be safer in the hands of people who have none of their own and who have been laboring for a century to strike ours down and in this same line it is pertinent to ask is the freeschool system safer in the hands of a party which has no sympathy with the system which in the south would not permit them to exist and in the north would close the free public schools because they are godless opposing them earnestly and honestly i admit but yet opposing them and on that ground i do not desire to occupy more time and in conclusion i have only to say that my rule of action is and shall henceforward be to judge of all parties as i judge of men i shall continue to act upon the suggestion of the prophet who said show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my works we can not gather grapes of thorns nor figs of thistles of the principles you have planted and the promises you have made we have gathered nothig that

his own order issued a document which is printed as senate executive document 170 from which extracts have been read today and i desire to state to this house that i find he quotes one hundred and twelve precedents fbr this action of his and yet when you read them and examine them you find that not a single precedent that he quotes bears him out or sustains him in his unauthorized and arbitrary order every one of these precedents was the withdrawal of some portion of the public domain from settlement and from entry but is not the order made by this executive officer of which we complain we do not complain because he withdrew some public lands from settlement but we do complain that after men under existing law had gone on the public domain had made settlements and homes were cultivating their landsl and doing that which entitled them under the law to a title and to occupy and possess them found themselves and all their proceedings suspended by the arbitrary action of the commissioner of these one hundred and twelve precedents which he cites not one sustains him no man who ever occupied that office or any other executive office of the government heretofbre arrogated to himself the right to suspend and strike down the statutes of this nation yet this man supposing himself supreme not content with the ruin with the wrong and injury he has worked tothese men has even arrogated to himself the right to say to congress and to the country the laws of the united states shall be suspended till it is my pleasure to put them again in execution and at the same time he directs the officers of the local land offices to violate their oaths and to deny to settlers the right to make entries and to secure homes on the public lands of these one hundred and twelve orders i find fiftysix were made by the late democratic vicepresident thomas a hendricks when he was commissioner of the general land office and i find that the fiftysix he made were all in the interestof landgrant railroads withdrawing some portions of the public domain in their interest and for their benefit but there is not an order cited that suspends an entry there is not an order that suspends a statute there is not an order that says to the local land officers you shall violate your oaths and not permit an honest settler on the pulilie domain to file his declaration and take the initiatory steps to secure a home and yet this officer is so obtuse or so willful that he can not observe the distinction between these orders and his own and cites them as authority for suspending the statutes of the united states violating his oath of office and wrecking and ruining hundreds and thousands of homes occupied by men as honest as can be found in any state or any country i do not deny the right of an executive officer to withdraw temporarily certain portions of the public domain from occupation or settlement but because this is true does it necessarily follow that when public land has been settled upon under existing law and homes made that those settlements can be destroyed those homes removed and all driven to litigation chaos and confusion and the law suspended and statutes stricken down by the arbitrary willful and slanderous order of a subordinate officer clothed with some brief authority when we contemplate the wrong this man has worked the injury he is now doing to the settlers of the west it isa remarkable circumstance to me that any man should stand here and say he derived pleasure from the injury and wrong great communities have been wellnigh prostrated by it and hundreds of honest settlers absolutely ruined as was said by my colleague no state ever developed so rapidly as the state i have the honor in part to represent and it has not been under fraudulent entries or by willful evasions of publicstatutes but it has been the result of honest bona fide settlement upon the public lands and yet these men now find their interests suspended they find as i have suggested that they are unable to obtain credit that they are unable to tax their lands unable to build schoolhouses unable to build bridges unable to secure railroad advantages or the conveniences that are needed bypioners upon the frontier because they can not get any title to their homes these in part are the injuries that are worked by this officer i regret exceedingly that i have not the time to

the land and under the seas that john a logan was dead to millions of men it came with a sense of personal loss and bereavement there were men among us of greater learning than he men more famous in statecraft more profound in the law more eloquent as orators and some few greater as soldiers but i greatly doubt whether among the sixty millions of people in this republic there was one other man whose death would have touched the hearts of so many persons with a feeling of individual loss as did the death of logan this is a phenomenon worthy of our study here was a man who was neither learned nor polished nor rich noraristocratic but he had made himself felt across this great continent and his name familiar among all englishspeaking people whatever other traits he may have possessed or may have lacked he was a forceful man wherever he came throughout his whole life men became conscious that a new force had entered into the problem to be solved a force that was positive and could not be ignored his was a masterful nature that bent circumstances to his will and b rought men around him to work with him and for him it is given to but few men in a generation to become so positive a force among his fellowman as logan was i said as logan was i might have said as logan is for character does not die with the mortal frame and his character his influence and his achievements have entered into the forces that are developing our national and individual life there seems to be an epoch in the formative stage of all new states favorable to the growth of strong men i was struck recently in reading the life of abraham lincoln with the remarkable group of men that sprung up in the early history of illinois when the seat of government was first removed to springfield there were found at that young capital at one time lincoln whose name stands second to nonein american history douglas the little giant lincolns great competitor for the presidency davis justice of the supreme court senator and acting vicepresident browning senator and cabinet officer trumbull senator and jurist baker senator and general and shields general and three times senator from as many different commonwealths it was while all these men were still upon the stage and in fact in the very prime of their early manhood that logan first appeared in political life in 1852 as a member of the illinois legislature he was an admirer and became a follower of stephen a douglas i am impressed with the belief that in many respects his character was more largely formed upon that of douglas than of any other man they had the same strong dominant will the same courage and fearlessness in following out a conviction the same pugnacity and persistence in fighting their contests to the finish they were alike exceedingly forceful among men and natural leaders under the influence of the example of such men as i have named logan began the career which was to be so potential for his country and for humanity a character is the product of all the forces that enter into it and the first great formative fbrce is heredity logan was of scotchirish descent a very sturdy and very vigorous stock which has given us some of the strongest men that have blessed our country the next great mold of character is the influences of childhood and youth logan was born upon a farm in the comparative isolation of a newly settled region his mother was of scotch descent and possessed those strong traits for which that people are distinguished the men around him were of the large strong generous type that develops upon the frontier and he inevitably partook of the spirit of the boundless prairie and the freedom that has never felt the fetters and constraints of aggregated humanity in cities just as he was emerging from youth came the war with mexico and a combination of patriotism with the spirit of adventure drew him into the ranks of the army in that struggle it was a mere episode in his life but it was an index to the character of the coming man then came the study of the law and at the age of twentysix we find him in the legislature of his state from which lincoln had but four years before graduated into the halls of congress after being again elected to the legislature in 1856 logan in 1858 was himself elected to congress at the age of thirtytwo where he commenced that public career which only ended when on the day after the last christmastide he laid all his honors and burdens down meanwhile a new force and influence had come into his life in 1855 he had married that devoted woman who thenceforth and throughout his life became his helper and his good genius we may not speak more of her here what his life would have been had he never met mary a cunningham it would bejimpossible to guess but it is safe to say that it would have been less useful and less illustrious than it was it was here in washington that his real career began and his real character shone forth the nation was already entering the penumbra of the dread eclipse of war the chill and shadow of the coming event was already upon the hearts of the people born as he was in southern illinois a promontory as it were of the free states projecting far down into the gulf of slavery and peopled largely with settlers from the adjacent slave states his whole political education was in sympathy with southern views and it was natural almost inevitable that he should ally himself with the party which had been the champion of southern institutions the great contest of 1858 between lincoln and douglas had been already fought and the same political wave that carried douglas back into the senate swept logan into the house while serving his first term here the whole country was startled and shocked by john browns raid upon harpers ferry it was a declaration of war by one man it was a small affair in itselfjust a fanatical old man and a few devoted followers hurling themselves to death upon the jagged rocks of a continent of wrong but it was the flash of the meteor bursting from obscurity lurid for a moment then plunging down to darkness and deeper night it was the low grumble and jar of the earthquake which tells that the sure and firmset earth is swimming beneath our feet old john brown was summarily tried convicted and hanged but his scaffold became the scene of exaltation of a grand selfimmolation for the uplifting of lowliest man john browns body lay moldering in the ground but his soul went marching on it marched to the south and it marched to the north and everywhere it was a gleaming sword summoning the nation to the deathstruggle of freedom and slavery we said that the only question was between union and disunion but we knew in our hearts that the issue was broader than thatthat the real issue was freedom or slavery and the hour had come for the nation to choose once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide in the strife of truth with falsehood for the good or evil side some great cause gods new messiah offering each the bloom or blight parts the goats upon the left hand and the sheep upon the right and the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light perhaps few men were ever more strongly attached to a party than logan was to his but when it came to a question between party and country he knew no such thing as party allegiance the first shot that cleft the stillness of charleston harbor as it boomed across the bay against sumter severed the last tie that bound him to a party he had loved and labored for until he had reached onehalf the allotted age of man in the fierce heat of his patriotism everything that might hold him back from supreme devotion to his country was burned awayutterly consumed he at once resigned his seat in congress and returned to his state that those who had looked to him as their political oracle might hear his rallying voice and be held firmly to the cause of the union with all the force and intensity of his nature he summoned his old political friends to the standard of his country and a short time saw him at the head of a volunteer regiment the thirtyfirst illinois it is no part of my purpose to follow him through the annals of the war it is a splendid record of patriotism devotion courage and magnificent leadership belmont donelson corinth champion hills jackson raymond and vicksburg witnessed his valor and took reflected luster from the gleam of his sword resaca kenesaw atlanta and jonesboro are linked with his fame and in large part owe their glory to his prowess he never elbowed his way to promotion but promotion came to him almost of necessity the eagle of the colonel gave way to the star on his shoulders after donelson and that again was replaced by the double stars of the majorgeneral and these were but imperfect indices of his growth as a soldier he was the very impersonation of intense energy men followed him because they had no choice but follow him he was first of all intensely patriotic he was as brave as patriotic and as magnanimous as he was brave he possessed the confidence of his superiors and the enthusiastic love of his soldiers of his return to congress after the war and his career here for almost twenty years i have not time to speak others have done that far better than i could but during the four years that i knew him here it seemed to me that his life as a senator and statesman was but the projecture into another sphere of the traits that made him the splendid soldier that he wasintense patriotism unlimited courage strong virile force honesty that was unassailable devotion to duty that took little account of consequences to self my acquaintance with general logan began almost immediately on my arrival at the capital the first business brought before the committee on which i had the honor to serve was the case of fitz john porter and in that connection i was at once brought into contact with general logan i was deeply impressed with the earnestness of his conviction and the intensity of his feelings and his utter loathing of what he believed to be a betrayal of trust as he would speak of it his indignation would flame up his form would seem to dilate and his eye would flash as if with the old light of battle and i could imagine how he would have ridden down the line as he did at peachtree creek with his black hair streaming on the wind and his battleblade flashing before his rushing battalions does any one doubt that logan was great no one but a great man can fill a continent with his name can hold a great commonwealth in his grasp can bind unknown millions to him who have never seen his face so that his loss shall seem to each a personal bereavement this logan did but he is discharged the service of this lifemustered out for promotion the devoted patriot the brave soldier the courageous statesman the unsoiled senator the devoted husband and father the soldiers friend

neither their loveliness nor their perfume had power to hold him back from the dissolution of mortality nor from the corruption of the grave and so with our eulogies today they will fade with the passing hour the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what he did here if his fame depended upon this fleeting breath of eulogy itwould not be worth the having his name may save our words from utter oblivion but all our praise will not prolong his memory by a single day his fame rests securely in the nation that he loved and helped to save in the millions of hearts that he taught the priceless lesson of patriotism in the thousands of homes that he made brighter and happier by his life his voice is silent in your council hall forever and

and personal recollections and i discuss the question partly from the standpoint of a participant in the second bull run campaign we have no reason to believe that the present discussion will develop any new facts or give us much new light the same old evidence so often sifted weighed arranged and rearranged is all we have in the ease now no witnesses can be summoned here who will not be recognized as old acquaintances they have been grouped over and over again and their testimony analyzed and dissected with critical minuteness and in opening this debate i shall occupy but little time in repeating what has already been so fullyrehearsed i have a fewgeneral propositions a few applications of evidence in bulk rather than in detail and as corroborative of other testimony in the ease i bring to bear a recollection in which i have a reasonable degree of confidencemy own i believe it is good military lawit is good military common sense anywaythat an officer at a distance from his superior must have some discretion in the execution of orders from that superior under the commanders immediate eye his directions are not to be deviated from for he is cognizant of all surroundings and all circumstances and alone responsible for errors of judgment but at a distance there are a thousand contingencies and circumstances unknown and unforeseen at headquarters that may interpose in the execution of a movement and render a departure from the strict letter of the order imperative the commander of an isolated corps who would involve his command in disaster which might be averted by literally obeying the letter of his instructions against obstacles of which the commanding general was ignorant would be properly branded as an incompetent and unworthy of command under such circumstances the spirit of the order is to be considered by the subordinate if its literal execution will clearly defeat the result aimed at he is a poor corps commander who would not mold his actions to the circumstances i apply this principle particularly to popes order of august 27 the failure to comply with which in the letter constitutes the first in the series of offenses with which porter was charged and upon which he was convicted nightfall of that day found jackson at manassas junction where he had been engaged in destroying such of popes captured stores as he had no immediate use for hooker marching from warrenton junction directly upon manassas had fought ewell at kettle run and was in bivouac upon jacksons front near bristee station and porter had just arrived at warrenton late in the evening porter received the order from pope whose headquarters were at bristoe to march at 1 oclock so as to be at bristoe by daylight pope contemplated an early morning attack upon jackson at manassas but jackson was not there to be attacked according to programme and it happened that porters delay whether constituting the grievous offense his enemies claim or not is chargeable with no evil consequences to the campaign had a fight occurred according to popes anticipations and had porter put his corps upon the road at 1 oclock as directed i believe for reasons which i shall fully state he would today be branded with the odium of incompetency in not observing the proper precautions for preserving the efficiency of his command the evacuation of warrenton at a given hour was not the essence of popes order but the appearance of the fifth corps at the other end of the route at as early an hour as possible and if it be shown that porter started as early as the conditions would permit whether it were 1 or 3 oclock and that he pushed forward with all possible dispatch he did all that could have been expected of him and only added one to thousands of precedents ever since war began where subordinate commanders have failed to move precisely as directed as to time direction or order and that without incurring the charge of treachery and the penalty of insubordination i believe he fulfilled the military requirements of the situation his troops i doubt not could have made a rapid march of 9 miles under favorable conditions for marching but i know that whatever the condition of the troops may have beenwhether fresh or exhaustedthe conditions of the road and of the night combined were such that no experienced soldier at i oclock would have placed upon that road a corps of nine thousand men with the expectation of holding them together for a forced march of 9 miles and if odium is to attach to this delay it must be shared by his division generals who after a proper examination of the road and the weather advised it that the road was crowded with trains at that time there is abundant evidence as to its general character i am satisfied to be guided by my own recollections which may be the weakest of evidence to every other member of this house but is the most convincing to myself it was my fortune to be a member in good standingof the first union regiment that passed over the road that daythe second new hampshire regiment of grovers brigade which furnished the skirmishers and led the advance of hookers division from catletts station to kettle run i remember it as a very ordinary country road in very bad condition and repair no man can tell me it was a broad spacious turnpike where troops could march in unbroken files for i know to the contrary i remember its ruts and sloughs and obstructions that for long distances the wayside trees and bushes grew almost to the very edge of the wheel tracks that at one point perhaps a mile from where the enemy was met at kettle run there was considerable difficulty even in broad daylight in passing the column over a stream where the bridge had been destroyed and it was over such a road as this packed with wagon trains that porter was expected to march the fifth corps of nine thousand men in hours of almost egyptian darkness i know there is evidenc of starlight at some time from some witnesses and that troops marched upon other roads but there certainly was not a very brilliant illumination when general patricks orderlies and staff officers dismounted to ibel their way along the road colonel brinton was not favorably impressed with the streetlighting arrangements when he went bumping along the roadrunning into first a tree and then a wagon and so dark that he was unable to distinguish either until upon it how the fifth corps would have gone galloping down that road at the rate of 3 miles an hour in order to be at 13ristoe by daylight but i have excellent reasons for remembering the condition of the night at one end of porters route at least i was on the picket line that night and yankee pickets upon stonewall jacksons front on the night of an engagement generally had a pretty keen eye for their surroundings i remember that hookers division was hardly in bivouac befbre a heavy mist settled down like a pall and held until dispelled by the morning sun and ireenforce my own recollections as to the darkness of the night by that of other members of my regiment general gilnan marston at that time in command of the regiment a former member of this house and well known to some of you an honored republican leader in my state attempted to visit the picket line that night but lost his way on account of the darkness and gave up the attempt and i take the liberty to say that he with other officers and men of the regimentrepublicans stand with me in pleading justice for general porter with such recollections i can arrive at but one conclusion that porter acted with sound military judgment in delaying his march until the conditions were such that he could hold his troops together and deliver them a compact effective force to his commander in military as in other affairs theory is one thing and practice is another you can not predicate the march often thousand men upon the distance one man can cover those of us who have marchedin the dusty column need not to be told howa body of troops disintegrates scatters and loses its cohesion under such circumstances as i have cited the best corps unable to preserve its military compactness degeneratesinto a sort ofgoasyouplease walking match scattered along the line of march and a great many please to go very slowto take very long rests and very frequent ones there are many instances to illustrate this inthe summer of 1863 the division of the third army corps withwhich i was connected was started for a night march from gum springs to monocacy following from edwards ferry the towpath of the canal we had a better road than that from warrenton to bristoe but when the general went into camp that night he had only a few hundred men with him the bulk of his command were bivouacked in little squads for miles along the river bank and it took a good part of the next day to bring the division together again these men were not tenderfoots nor green troops they were the veterans of the white diamond i and only a few days later fought at gettysburg with a stubborn valor and a discipline never excelled the division general was an officer of marked ability but in this instance he erred in practical judgment with the result that for many hours his command was virtually obliterated as an effective force it is a dangerous error to commitin my mind an inexcusable onewhere everything may depend upon keeping troops well in hand and in compact organization and the fact that porter avoided such a blunderthe judicious exercise of a discretion for which be should have been thanked and applaudedwas made one of the counts upon which he was tried convicted cashiered and disgraced i refuse to sign the verdict i have no personal prejudices for or against to bias my judgmient in this matter the strongest prejudices i have ever entertained were against porter but they disappeared when i proceeded to examine the case i do not accept the estimate of pope which is entertained by many of porters friends it was his misfortune to be transferred from a command where he had won honorable distinction it was against his own wishes and judgment as he sets forth in a recent magazine article i will not assert that he did not do as well as any other would have done under the manifold difficulties which he fbund readymade in his new command he was called to face difficulties and untangle a desperate condition of affairs in the making of which lie had no hand and no responsibility that lie failed should not be quoted to his discredit more than the failure of many another under less trying conditions he was precipitated into a campaign bewildering in the rapidity and complication of its movements against the best military leaders and the best troops of the confederacy upon a field with which he was but imperfectly acquainted and without opportunity to establish with his own troops those relations of mutual confidence and understanding that are so important between commander and men there was more than one disappointment in the execution of his plans porter was not the only officer upon whom he throws the burden of disappointing him at a critical moment that reynolds and sigel did not reenforce king on the afternoon of the 28th he says seems unaccountable the reason giventhat mcdowell was absent from the corps having lost his wayhe says is not satisfactory to his great disappointment and surprise i quote his own language he learned the next morning that king had fallen back toward manassas junction and that neither sigel nor reynolds had been engaged others than porter failed to meet his expectations and at critical moments too in the mild way i have quoted he makes them to a certain extent scapegoats for the failure of his campaign but they continued to be honored and trusted as they deserved to be it is rarely that all the details of such a campaign as this move according to preconceived order and plan all of these officers who as he says failed him at times subsequently did desperate fighting in the execution of his orders and none better than porter and the selection of porter from them all to be branded as a traitor and made responsible for the failure of the campaign i look upon as largely in the spirit of a return of compliments if we could read the minds of men if we could view the hidden springs which influence their actions even when they are unaware we should find that it was porters disrespectful and inexcusable allusions to pope cropping out at times which pointed him as an object of suspicion and a mark for revenge mcdowell or sigel or heintzelman never would have been tried for the failures of movement upon which porter was tried i believe if either of these officers had been in porters place and he in theirs and they had conducted their movements precisely as he did his we should never have had the courtmartial which was subsequently convened and no union general of that campaign would have suffered for more than twenty years a stigma worse than death there was no breach of military discipline so common as this and if the results of campaigns had been influenced by the expressed opinions of subordinates concerning superiors many a battle that was won by the courage and devotion of the growlers would have been lost and if those so offending had been made the subjects of military discipline the army would speedily have been resolved into one great general courtmartial fitzjohn porter was one of the growlers but his punishment has been out of all proportion to his offense the elimination of a few unfortunate words of his from this case would have weakened it in an astonishing degree but for the antagonisms they naturally aroused gainess mill savage station white oak swamp and malvern hilla military record without a blemishwould have counted as something against his failure to execute orders impossible to execute at warrenton and groveton i have dwelt upon the order of the 27th somewhat in the character of a witness stating the reasons which led to my absolute conviction of porters innocence in my judgment thereisnotapinthereupon which to hang a suspicion of insubordination in motive or in act the disproving of bad intentions and bad conduct here not only removes a specific charge from the case against porter but measurably weakens the presumption of treacherous disobedience on the 29th it is not my purpose to beat the old straw so often beaten or to recapitulate in detail the evidence so often repeated here it should be by this time as familiar as household words upon it grant and schofield and terry and getty grounded their belief in porters innocence my general conclusions in regard to the 29th i summarize very briefly there can be no question i think that popes first order to march upon centreville was complied with the disobedience did not commence there there can be no question that the joint order directing the movement toward gainesville was complied with and he was executing the order of general pope in letter and in spirit when at dawkins branch he was confronted by conditions of which pope was absolutely ignorant in his joint order he had informed porter thatthe indications are that the whole force of the enemy is moving in this direction at a pace that will bring them here by tomorrow night or the next day but porter found that it was not tomorrow night or the next day that he might look for the arrival of longstreet for longstreet had already arrived and was at that moment confronting him a mounted man direct from gainesville met them with the startling news that he had seen the enemys skirmishers there with their main body close behind a little farther on porters skirmishers encountered those of the enemy and he posted his batteries and placed his troops in position prisoners were takenlongstreets menand information was received from buford that as early as 8 45 that morning seventeen regiments with battery and cavalry had passed through gainesville it is very easy to say that porter should have attacked inthe orders to this time received therewere no directions to attack assoonascommunications were established with the forces upon the right he was directed to halt it is unquestionable that when pope issued the joint order he was under the impression and belief that there was a free road to gainesville and beyond it rests upon his own testimony before the courtmartial that when he issued the 4 30 order to porter it was for an attack upon jacksons right porters fault in the judgment of those who condemned him was not that he did not attack longstreet but that he neglected to give the finishing blow to jackson before longstrect arrived with the actual situation upon porters front as he knew it then and as we know it now with no specific orders to attack until the 4 30 order came the whole question of disobedience is brought to that one point if the evidence of half a dozen officers at porters headquarters is to be given any weight that order did not reach porter until after sundown if porters division generals are truthful men he went to the front had troops deployed and advanced but did not attack deterred by the protests of his officers when the strength of the enemy and of his position was developed in the increasing gloom of night this was not the spirit of an insubordinate officer feneral porter knew that pope absolutely misapprehended the situation but for all that he started to carry out the order and it was for us the one fortunate feature of that campaign of disaster that it was received too late to be put into execution since the courtmartial we have had opened up sources of information not then available if there is one man above all others who should be presumed to know the actual situation on porters front who should be able to clear up the disputed point as to the position of longstreets corps whose judgment we would accept as to the probable results of movements in that portion of the field that man is general longstreet himself he gave his testimony before the schofield board and we can not ignore his statements as a concise summary i call attention to an extract from his article entitled our march against pope in the february number of the century magazine it not only shows how completely general pope misunderstood the actual situation but making all due allowance which prejudice can possibly suggest it points with the finger of a military expert the disastrous results which might have come to the union arms had porter precipitated himself not upon jacksons right but upon longstreets veterans outnumbering him two or three to one general longstreet says general pope sanguine by nature was not careful enough to keep himself informed about the movements of his enemy at half past 4 on the afternoon of the 29th he issued an order for porter to attack jacksons right supposing i was at thoroughfare gap when in fact i had been in position since noon and was anxiously awaiting attack it has been said that general stuart by raising a dust in front of porter so impressed him that he did not offer battle i know nothing of the truth of the story andnever heard of it till after the war if from any such cause porter was prevented from attacking me it was to our disadvantage and delayed our victory twentyfour hours porter knew i was in his front he had captured one or two of my men which gave him information of my position before ie actually saw me if porter had not appeared when lie did i would have attacked by our right early in the afternoon in that event porter would have had a fine opportunity to take me on the wing and strike a fearful blow as it was he was a check upon my move against popes main position if i hpd advanced upon pope i would have been under an enfilade fire from porters batteries and if i had advanced upon porter i would have been under a fire from the batteries on popesfrontas severe as the raking fire from my batteries the next day when pope was massed against jackson had porter attacked me between noon and night on the 29th i should have received his nine thousandwith about double that number iwould have held my line to receive the attack and as soon as his line developed its strength i would have thrown three brigades forward beyond his extreme left when my line of battle had broken up the attack as it certainly would have done these three brigades would have been thrown forward at the flank and at the same time my main line would have pushed on in the pursuit the result would have been porters retreat in confusion and i might possibly have reached popes left and rear in time to cut him off when his army was well concentrated on the 30th he was badly cut up and defeated it does not seem unreasonable to conclude that attack on the 29th in his disjointed condition would have been attended with more disastrous results to him if i had been attacked under the 4 30 order the result might have been less damaging as porter would have had the night td cover his retreat and the federal army could have availed itself of the darkness to screen its move back across bull run but porters attack at night if not followed by the retreat of the army would have drawn me around the federal left and put me in a position for striking the next day colonel marshal of general lees staff in his evidence before the fitzjohn porter board puts my forces on the 29th at thirty thousand it is difficult to see how porter with nine thousand men was to march over thirty thousand of the best soldiers the world ever knew any move that would have precipitated battle would have been to our advantage as we were ready at all points and waiting for an opportunity to fight the situation will be better understood when we reflect that the armies were too evenly balanced to admit mistakes on either side i was waiting for an opportunity to get into the federal lines close upon the iels of their own troops the opportunity came on the 30th butthe federal army was then concentrated had it come on the 29th i would have been greatly pleased one point in the report of the schofield board should be especially impressed upon this housethat section wherein they prick the bubble so often blown in debatethe big guns bellowing this way fitzjohn porter it will bear repeating the judgment of the courtmartial upon general porters conduct was evidently based upon greatly erroneous impressions not only respecting what that conduct really was and the orders under which he was acting but also respecting all the circumstances under which he acted especially was this true in respect to the character of the battle of the 29th of august that battle consisted of a number of sharp and gallant combats between small portions of the opposing forces those combats were of short duration and were separated by long intervals of simple skirmishing and artillery duels until after 6 oclock only s small part of the troops on either side were engaged at any time during the afternoon then about sunset one additional division on each side was engaged near groveton the musketry of that last contest and the yells of the confederate troops about dark were distinctly heard by the officers of porters corps but at no other time during all that afternoon was the volume of musketry such that it could be heard at the position of porters troops no sound but that of artillery was heard by them during all those hours when porterwas understood by the courtmartial to have been listening to the sounds of a furious battle raging immediately to his right and those sounds of artillery were by no merans such as to indicate a general battle the reports of the 29th and those of the 30th of august have somehow been strangely confounded with each other even the confederate reports have since the termination oftthe war been similarly misconstrued those ofthe3oth have been misquoted as referring to the 29th thus to prove that a furious battle was going on while porter was comparatively inactive on the 29th the fierce and gallant struggle of his own troops on the 30th has thus been used to sustain the original error under which he was condemned general porter was in effect condemned for not having taken any part in his own battle there are perhaps others than myself upon this floor who can bear testimony to the correctness of these findings the manner in which my own brigade was put in was a sample of this days work where are mysupports inquired grover of the aide when his line was formed in the edge of the woods oh they are coming was the response your orders are to advance at once and carry the railroad embankment with the bayonet it was all over inside of ten minutes five hundred men of grovers skeleton brigade lay dead or wounded and what there was left came back to reform and to hunt for those supports they came up after a time went in as we had gone in and came out as we came out and so it went on through the entire day of the 29thsharp dashes quickly over with long intervals of time between there was no time when the artillery firing was general continuous or heavy and the plan of the day if plan there was seems to have been to put in one brigade at a timeand veteran brigades were small in the armyone brigade at a time to be slaughtered overwhelmed and repulsed no matter how desperate the assault nor how well sustained and i assert that even to those in the immediate vicinity of the fighting those to the north of the centreville pike there was nothing in the volume or character of the firing to indicate a general engagement it was on the following day when the lines were blazing from the henry hill to groveton that the fight took the character of a general engagement with a continuous roar of both musketry and artillery that made itself heard even in washington it was then that the big guns were bellowing this way fitzjohn porter i and that they did not call in vain is attested by the official reports and by the deathroll of the fifth corps then recorded all sorts of sympathies and prejudices have been appealed to against porter he has been compared to benedict arnold one with unimpaired skill and vhlor led his command in one of its hardest fights and was trusted with important commands for months after every item ot his alleged treason had been committed the other fled in haste to the enemy took arms in their service and cast his fortunes with therforevermore and i have been greatly impressed within a few days by the statement made to me by a distinguished member of this housedne who will not vote as i shall vote upon this billthat he was in position to daily observe fitzjohn porter in the early days of his retirement and disgrace and was struck by the eagerness with which he scanned the papers for war news his unconcealed disgust over union reverses and his exultation over the triumphs of our arms the political prejudices of the war times are appealed to no man possesses them in a greater degree than myself but they are not to lead me into an indorsement of what i consider a wrong to a patriotic union soldier how often have we been appealed to by the memory of those who fell at groveton a worse than useless sacrifice and all ascribed to porters treachery but with all due modesty i shall insist that none can have a better right to speak for the patriotic dead of that great field than the members of grovers brigade we are appealed to for a vindication of the memory and judgment of abraham lincoln the man will never live who has a greater reverence for that name and memory than i have there are two names that will pass down in history linked together as the saviours of the union the hand of the great civil leader fell from the helm just as the ship of state he had guided so skillfully came sailing into port the captain who led our armies left us only the other day both at one time equally believed in the justice of porters sentence but he to whom the opportunity was given for a calm dispassionate review of the case proclaimed the injustice of the verdict and became the earnest champion of porters cause and he is a bold man who today dares impugn the military judgment and honesty of purpose of ulysses s grant we know lincolns great sense of justice and humanity we know that in the darkest days of the war he could plead with malice toward none with charity for all could he speak today he would ask no man to stifle an honest conviction nor to halt in what he might consider the path ofjustice simply as an indorsement of his signature upon a courtmartial verdict and had it been permitted to him to live as grant lived i believe they would have stood together in their demand for justice to fitzjohn porter the political prejudices of the present day should not be a factor in this discussion the statement in the minority report now before us that the republican members of the fortyeighth congress holding in reverence the memories of the great war secretary who convened the court the illustrious men who constituted it and the lamented president who approved its findings voted with approximte unanimity against reopening the case is just a grain misleading the republican minority who then voted for porter was not only respectable in point of numbers but the character of their republicanism is such that i do not feel out of place in their company and speaking for the constituency i representfor the district in which at portsmouth by the sea fitzjohn porter first saw the light of dayi know that i am backed in my position and my vote by thousands of my own political faith soldiers as well as civilians i am not inappreciative nor unmindful of the moral influence of such a support but if i stood solitary and alone among all the republicans of this country in supporting this bill i should vote as i have voted once and as i shall vote again to do otherwise would be to outrage my own convictions and belittle my own judgment i have no personal acquaintance with fitzjohn porter i never met him and should not know him were i to meet him today there are no personal friendships no social or political influences to direct my judgment in his favor i act simply upon my convictions of right and justice and the equities of his case"], [0.13943153619766235, 0.8605684638023376, 1, "no that is the aggregate cost per annum i now call the

remember the bombardment of alexandria by the british fleet in 1882 stone flrts like ours at boston and new york afforded no protection before modern artillery they were as if made of cardboard two years ago in the lilian river china the chinese fleet was attacked by the french under admiral courbet the chinese had eleven vessels mounting fortyfive guns the french fleet was about twice as strong it was thoroughly modernships guns and torpedoes the chinese were anchored under their forts lieutenant osterhaus who witnessed the battle in his report says in less than half an hour the entire chinese fleet was destroyed and all that could be seen of the fine fleet were hulks in flames or sunken vessels it was simply a massacre the loss of the french was seven men the loss of the chinese from eight hundred to fifteen hundred against such a fleet as the french had in that battle our ships now in commission would be utterly worthless as a fair sample of our navy i may state that the alliance one of the eight wooden ships suddenly built when we were in dispute with spain about the virginius affair in 1873 recently refitted and furnished with new engines has just reported her speed as 9 knots an hour a firstclass modern cruiser makes 18 knots even an armored vessel makes 16 aid 17 in all our navy we have but one that makes 13 knots the trenton the truth is that our navy could neither run away nor fight we have not afloat a single highpower gunnot a gun that could pierce the armor of the brazilian steamer riachuelo this vessel carries four 9inch and four smaller modern breechloading rifles she is protected by armor 10 to 11 inches thick and makes over 16 knots an hour at sea against any of our vessels or all of them she could choose absolutely her own distance for battle it is humiliating to say it but if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in midocean and confronted by the riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the american flag would ever get into port and if in the mle and the chase which followed some ship by leaving its fellows should escape into port the brazilian could follow and destroy it under the guns of any fort we have we have not even a safe harbor of refuge for a fleeing vessel your committee having this matter in charge have been deeply impressed with the defenseless condition of our country if we could believe that tha days of war had passed we would be glad to abolish our naval academy discharge our naval officers on some terms that would be just to them make a bonfire of such of our vessels as we could not sell and go home and tell our constituents we had economized for one i believe unless we are prepared to take steps to render our navy more efficient which it is not now either for purposes of peace or war we ought to abolish it your committee were not ready to recommend this step so we framed with care a bill to increase our naval establishment and brought it into this house on the 10th of march every president this government ever had from washington down to the present day recognized the necessity of putting the country in a condition to resist attacks by sea i will not stop to quote from them all in his annual message december 2 1834 andrew jackson said the wide seas which separate us from other governments must of necessity he the theater on which an enemy will aim to assail us and unless we are prepared to meet him on this element we can not be said to possess the power requisite to repel or prevent agressions we can not therefore watch with too much attention this arm of our defense or cherish with too much care the means by which it can possess the necessary efficiency and extension here is jackson advising congress to cherish the navy in order that we may be prepared to repel or prevent aggressions i and here we have had a distinguished gentleman on this floor arguing that we ought not to consider a bill to increase that navy even in its present pitiable plight because we do not represent a timid people let me commend also to the consideration of this house the words of president tyler who in his first annual message said it is due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the united states that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters at pleasure and subject our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage economy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public agents of the people but parsimony alone could suggest the withholding of the necessary means for the protection of our domestic firesides from invasion and our national honor from disgrace i would most earnestly recommend to congress to abstain from all appropriations for objects not absolutely necessary but i take upon myself without a moment of hesitancy all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant navy which has lighted up every sea with its victories and spread an imperishable glory over the country all our recent presidents have recommended the increase of our naval establishment president cleveland is very emphatic he says in his message all must admit the importance of an effective navy to a nation like ours having such an extended seacoast to protect and yet we have not a single vessel of war that could keep the seas against a firstclass vessel of any important power such a condition ought not longer to continue the nation that can not resist aggression is constantly exposed to it its foreign policy is of necessity weak and its negotiations are conducted with disadvantage because it is not in condition to enforce the terms dictated byits sense of right and justice the recent patriotic letter of our great statesman mr tilden too is fresh in our minds but it is urged with great persistency that we ought not to expend money in building a navy because improvements are constantly being made in the material of war but ships to go to sea will always be necessary in shape there has been little change since the days of the phenicians we build them stronger and larger but the limit of practicable size seems to have been reached and passed long ago in the great eastern we build them of better material but are we now to stand still until some other substance shall supplant steel improvements are still going on in the application of motive power but what gentleman here is willing to leave our seacoast undefended while he waits for something to supersede steam again guns as offensive weapons heavy guns for long range and lighter guns for rapid firing at close quarters must always be in use torpedoes may and i think will become more effective for some purposes but guns will probably never be superseded in fact there has strictly speaking been no revolution in the art of war simply a development and in the opinion of the best authorities the advance has reached a point beyond which the development is not likely to be so rapid as in the past but if this argument that we must not build ships and guns and torpedoes at this time because the future will develop something superior to what we know of at present is good now it will always be good for improvements will continue till human ingenuity shall fail washington adams madison monroe jackson polk and pierce listened to no such argument as this they waited not on other nations but took the lead in developing and improving ships and guns and fortifications they held themselves always in readiness to defend and maintain the rights of our fellowcitizens native and adopted at home and abroad what american is there who does not remember with pride how in 1853 the gallant captain ingraham saved martin kostza from an austrian prison when the liberties of this foreigner who was not even an adopted citizen but had simply declared his intention to become such were endangered there was an american ship to offer him refuge and the american flag to welcome and protect him it was the old democratic idea that while a large standing army was dangerous to the liberties of the citizen an efficient navy was the right arm of the nation it was its broad policy its bold aggressiveness its ever readiness with the will and the means to defend our rights that attracted to the standard of democracy equally the generous youth of the land and the libertyloving foreigner who sought our shores if we who belong to this grand old party were looking no further than to party advantage the same elements are with us today and the same reasons would impel us to a similar policy but this is not and ought not to be made a party question i have seen some indications here that there was a disposition on the part of a few gentlemen on the other side of this chamber to put impediments in the way of this bill in order as it occurred to me that party capital might be made by reason of a failure of the democratic majority here to answer the demands of the country but sir i can not believe that any such motives will actuate gentlemen now that the question is up for consideration this bill is not for party but for the countrya bill for the common defense the great purpose for which the union of these states was formed it is a reasonable bill and both sides must be for it the republicans have been demanding an increase of our naval establishment they cl4im to be friends of the navy and as for democrats they certainly will not desert the traditions of their party i have said sir that this bill was reasonable it provides for a very moderate increase our government has never sought to have the largest navy in the world our insulated position always gave us advantages which rendered this unnecessary but it was deemed essential by the statesmen of the past that we should keep pace with all the improvements in maritime warfare that our ships should be among the best that floated that our guns should be equal to any in the world and that we should demonstrate our capacity rapidly to increase our navy to any required extent all this we accomplished it is now just thirty years ago since we put in commission four ships which with their guns were superior to anything that floatedthe wabash the merrimac the niagara and minnesota the wabash went to england and became the sensation of the day english sailors and merchants and shipbuilders crowded her decks the prince of wales came down to see the vessel and the guns which proclaimed that america was foremost among nationsnot in the number but in the character of her ships and their armament why should we abandon the policy approved by the statesmen of the past what security have we against the recurrence of war our true policy is peace but a defenseless nation often finds it difficult to maintain its neutrality in time of war it was the violation of our rights as a neutral that forced us into the war of 1812 in case of war now between great britain and any other great maritime power our immense carrying trade most of which is at present in foreign bottoms would seek our flag and i ask gentlemen to thinkhow could we protect it without a navy sir even while i speak there are unsettled questions with canadian fishermen these questions are not without their dangers toaddto the complication the english doubtless feel some offense at the sympathy shown by americans for the irish in their struggle for home rule and it was only last year we had occasion to use our navy on the isthmus of panama great britain claims treaty rights and frenchmen have interests there what if france or england had forbidden our interference and war had resulted sir it is not too much to say that our navy would go down before that of france or england or germany or italy in half an hour like that of china before admiral courbct war in this age of steam is short sharp and terrible austria was defeated at sadowa seventeen days after her emperor had issued his war manifesto napoleon iii surrendered himself with one hundred thousand men at sedan within fortyseven days after he had declared war against prussia if a naval descent upon our coast cities were planned it would come almost like the lightning it would be upon us before breakfast sir i can not understand gentlemen who shut their eyes upon the lessons of experience and philosophize themselves into the belief that war will never come again twentysix years ago i listened to a great orator theorizing in that manner he was the most eloquent man i ever heard he stood by a cotton bale which was on end before him as he spoke he was arguing that secession would be peaceable that there would be no war that europe could not afford to let the north coerce the south after discoursing eloquently upon the distress that would come upon the industrial world if the supply of cotton should be cut off by a blockade he brought his hand down upon it and proclaimed with triumphant emphasis this cotton bale will command the peace within four years and a half mighty armies had swept over the spot where he spoke leaving death desolation and despair behind them and the great orator had sunk brokenhearted into his grave the old democratic idea as expressed by james k polk was that our navy should be increased in proportion to the growing interests to be protected i by it let us contrast our present expenditures with those made thirty years ago for the navy in 1856 our population was 27 000 000 our exports and imports combined six hundred and twentyfive millions and our wealth eleven and a half billions of dollars that was the day of wooden ships and castiron guns our expenditures for the navy in that year were 14 074 000 and this was not an exceptional expenditure the appropriations for the navy were more than fourteen millions in 1858 and more than fourteen millions in 1859 now in this day of steel ships and steel guns incalculably more expensive with a population of 55 000 000 with exports and imports combined amounting to thirteen hundred and seventytwo millions and wealth equal to 54 000 000 000in other words when our population has more than doubled our exports and imports more than doubled and our wealth quintupled we have just passed in the house a bill appropriating for the expenses of the navy less than 13 000 000 if we should carry out president polks idea and increase our naval establishment in proportion to the magnitude of the interests to be protected and certainly a due proportion of all this increase is in the cities on our coast we should spend on the navy more than 28 000 000 this would give us for the increase of the naval establishment 15 000 000 per annum sir it would be an easy matter to put our navy back where it belongs to give it that place among the navies of the world assigned to it by the wise statesmanship of the past we have but to make moderate appropriations from an overflowing treasury avail ourselves of the experience of other nations the results of which are all at hand and rely on the enterprise and talent of our people in no other field has american genius shone more conspicuous than in fashioning material of war look back at some of its achievements in 1861 the confederates almost without workshops armored the virginia and hearing of the progress of the work on that vessel in ninety days the federals built the monitor to match it the noise of the conflietbetween these two vessels in hampton roads reverberated around the world and as the echoes came back to us they were mingled with the sound of the hammers that had been set going in the workshops of europe from these two american inventions and from the development of the torpedo by the confederates have come the modern ship of w 4r and the modern torpedo the yankee has make the best pistols the best smallarms and the best rapidfiring guns in the world the gatling and the hotchkiss and see what we have already accomplished in ordnance here at the navyyard in washington we have only justbegun and yet we are making guns which are not copies of but improvements upon the best guns in the world the highest velocity ever imparted to a prijectile from a 6inch gun was obtained from a piece tested atannapolis on the 30th of last march if we are ever to undertake the work of rehabilitating our navy we ought to begin it now in a time of profound peace every step ought to be taken with great care and deliberation the modern vessel like the modern gun is a work of high art to plan it in detail is a great labor and requires time and patience to build it requires time and patient labor the act of march 3 1883 authorized the construction of three cruisers and a dispatch boat these were the first modern vessels ordered by congress secretary chandler began at once to devise them on the 28th of april lie advertised for offers the contracts were closed in july 1883 and the vessels were to be built all within eighteen months and still these ships the chicago boston atlanta and dolphin are not completed they will all however be ready for sea before march nextthat is within four years from the passage of the act authorizing them the 186 000 necessary to their completion is carried in the annual appropriation bill the delays in the construction of these ships those which occurred before the failure of the contractor resulted from alteration of plans after the vessels were begun this has been a frequent cause of delay in the construction of such vessels a careful study of the history of recent naval shipbuilding in england shows that delays in the construction of modern vessels are inevitable they occur if not in maturing plans then certainly afterward in altering them the ravensworth report sets this forth clearly the act of march 1885 authorized the construction of two more cruisers and two gunboats and appropriated for that purpose 1 895 000 with the experience before him gained from the construction of the boston chicago atlanta and dolphin the new secretary went very carefully to work his purpose has been to perfect jilans before giving out work he believes it is better that delays should occur before than after construction begins and he hopes by taking great pains with plans to avoid the necessity for alterations it therefore results that invitations for proposals have not yet been advertised such advertisements however will be out in a few days one of these vessels the secretary proposes to build after the plans of the naniwakan a 4 000ton cruiser recently built by an english firm for the japanese government this vessel is the fastest of her class in the world making 18 9 knots an hour it is the last and best result of twenty years of costly experience in the building of metal ships in england the secretary bought from the builder the plans and working drawings all complete with one accord american shipbuilders and their designers who have examined these plans approve the project and they believe that having these plans to work from we will hereafter improve upon them utilizing information gained from the experience of other nations is precisely what we have already done in our ordnance bureau and it is the theory upon which the navy department has always proceededthat to be abreast of the times we should have accurate knowledge of all improvements abroad it is what every enginebuilder and shipbuilder in this country does prior to 1882 each bureau in the navy department obtained this information for itself march 23 1882 secretary hunt established the office of naval intelligence secretary chandler continued and fostered it and secretary whitney has still further utilized it i feel sure that the result will vindicate the wisdom of thesecretarys course your committee does not believe as i have before said that we are called upon to build a navy equal to that of england or france at the same time we should not utterly disregard what has been done and is doing elsewhere we do not believe we have yet passed entirely beyond the wisdom of president polk who in his first annual message december 2 1845 said considering an increased naval force and especially of steamvessels corresponding with our growth and importance as a nation and proportioned to the increased and increasing naval powerof other nations of vast importance as regards our safety and the great and growing interests to be protected by it i recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of congress let us look a moment at the fleets of other nations great britain

with a splendid physique courage energy and a strong will le was well equipped for the boisterous voyage of life on which he was launched he was a typical american a selfmade man he started a poor boy and lived and died a poeo maln p185 he imbibed from the widestretching prairies surrounding his humble home broad views and the true idea of freedom he was a man possessed of profound convictions and of unbending will if he believed he was in the right all his personal and intellectual qualties were positive in debate he was direct intense fearless bold in the assertion of his convictions impetuous in their vindication he scorned evasion and despised hypocrisy in the performance of duty he took no account of results and feared no consequences he was familiar with all the weapons of debate and he at times wielded the gentle powerof persuasion the convincing lbrce of logic and the strong blows of ridicule often sweeping before him in a tempestuous outburst of eloquence all opposition to the high resolves and earnest convictions of his mighty soul if he lost anything by neglected education his great genius supplied the defect he always had his armor on and logan either in the forum or on the battlefield was ever ready for the rencounter he was the advocate of liberty and the devoted friend of the human race he loved his friends with unswerving fidelity and never deserted them he was a friend of truth and iated treason whether against hiis country or his friend he sought to preserve the union and maintain the constitution he was the advocate of the universal freedom of man he labored to restore peace and amity between the sections of our country and performed his full share in healing the animosities engendered by the war he sought to cherish industry and protect labor he encouraged the settlement of our vast domain and the development of our resources he came from the humbler class and his sympathies were always with the poor and the sons of toil he was from them and one of them along the highway over which our country and people have journeyed during the past quarter of a century john a logan may be seen and traced if he was your antagonist he was an open one scorning to attack by stealth or fight from ambush he struck his blows in front and in daylight ready to forgive and forget a slight or insult done him he was as eager to repair an injury done another wherever he was found he was stolid sincere intense firm honest and courageous if he was a brilliant figure in the political arena he was none the less so in the military it mattered little to logan whether on the field of battle or in the halls of congress whether conducting his troops at the assault of donelson or maintaining a debate in the senate of the united states whether managing a great presidential campaign or leading his army through georgia whether caressing his loved ones at home or enduring the privations of army life whether trudging along the ranks as a private soldier or riding his charger at the head of his army when our civil war burst like a terrible tempest upon the nation logan buckled on his sword rushed to battle and never halted until slavery was dead freedom reigned triumphant and the union of all the states secured as resistless against the foe as an avalanche rushing headlong from alpine heights to desolate the plains below he combined the desperation of charles xii with the generosity of a cmsar see general logan and his troops storming the battlements at vicksburg first to break down the enemys stronghold and lead the advance into the captured city and as long as the king of rivers flows by those bluffs will the heroism of logan and his men be remembered the memorable assault he led at kenesaw will be remembered while that mountain stands on its foundations of granite but he appeared most conspicuous on july 22 1864 in front of atlanta the confederate general hood made a desperate assault on the union forces to free himself from the iron grasp of sherman in this engagement the army of the tennessee was driven back and general mcpherson its commander fell logan at once assumed command he found the troops fatigued and dispirited the enemy enthusiastic and exultant in their temporary victory cannon to right of them cannon to left of them cannon in front of them volloyd and thunderd logan appeared upon the scene he aroused the energies of his men for battle cheered the despondent and rallied the faltering with head uncovered his long black hair flying over his shoulders as he galloped hl foaming

his troops caught the spirit of their commander and hope and confidence assumed sway they sprang into the conflict rushed upon the enemy and in an hours time regained all that had been lost and turned threatened defeat into a glorious victory it was this ajax of the army of the north who saved that day the heroic deeds of general logan in this battle will not be forgotten while the name of atlanta is spoken by the children of men although he had not the benefit of a military education yet he rose to the highest rank ever held by a volunteer officer in our country and he is justly entitled to the name of being the greatest general of the volunteer army of the union he served his country because be loved it during his military life he suffered much and endured much was torn and mangled by shot received in action yet he declined to receive a pension to which he was justly entitled his services were not rendered for bounty nor was his patriotism to be measured by dollars and cents that his life was shortened by his exposures sufferings and wounds there is no room to doubt but a mighty patriotic people will cheerfully give to his disconsolate widow that pension which her husband declined while alive although i had but a limited acquaintance with this great chieftain yet i knew him as i saw him at the head of his troops in tennesseeand georgia and as i read him in the history of the times he was the idol of the volunteer soldier who loved him for his untiring devotion to their cause in peace as much as for his leadership in war logan had a heart that never ceased to beat in sympathy and respect for the soldier that fought by his side and to those heroic men who battled against him he held out the hand of a generous foe in peace lie had no fortune but his genius courage and faith in war no friend but his valor and sword yet we see him measuring arms with men of experience rank and power and write his name high on the escutcheon of fame leaving the world
