to him he has enjoyed for many yezirs the confidence the esteem and the warm affection of the people of my state and when i refer to the peopleof my state i refer especially to the great farmer

frequently come to you for legislation in reference to it there was a time and that time was not long ago when as all now admit gamblers on the cotton exchange had for years been protected in methods used for fleecing producers honest dealers an 1 manufacturers of cotton they had been giyen the right in the fulfillment of contracts made on the exchange to tender any kind of cotton and thus they were enabled to press down the prices of this great staple in the effort to correct this abuse congress first limited the tenderable grades on exchange contracts to 21 it was soon found that speculative traders on the exchange could under the law tender badly mixed lots of lowgrade cotton within these 21 grades and thereby in a large way depress fhe price of cotton congress then seeking to further check and correct this abuse limited the tenderable grades to 10 on exchange contracts it has been clearly shown that even with this limitation speculators on the exchange market are yet able to assemble unusable and unmarketable mixed lots of cotton within these 10 grades for tender and thus with safety and impunity constantly cause wide fluctuations between the exchange and commercial value of cotton the reason why cotton is not now forced to much lower levels by the speculators on the exchange is the grim determination of holders of spot cotton not to sell wlhen these fluctuations occur many have been the vicious attacks of the gamblers on the exchange to push down the price of spot cotton within the last five or six months by causing wide differences between thae exchange and the commercial value of cotton their effort have failed only because of the ability of holders of spots not to sell their holdings when these onslaughts of speculators occur the law as it now exists invites overselling and makes it easy for the speculator who thus oversells to protect himself from loss the time allotted me will not permit a full and detailed discussion of this subject

pennsylvania mr moore of pennsylvania a more or less enforced absence of five weeks has caused me to overlook many of the details of the prolonged hearings of the ways and means committee with regard to the longworth dyestuffs bill but the story is so interesting that perhaps it were better for a brief spell to talk without notes or without attempting to quote from the records dyestuffs are fairly well protected now so far as tariff duties are concerned the bill before us proposes to put the rates so high that they will be practically prohibitive with respect to every one of the commodities referred to in section 500 there is very little that we use in the united states in the way of dyestuffs not comprehended in this bill there may be some things the nomenclature of which does not come within our grasp dyestuff terms are peculiar they are jaw breaking but they are extremely important when it comes to specifying just what they are and what their effect is with regard to manufactures with regard to war munitions during the hearings much was made of the importance of the dyestuff industry to war munitions probably that was the crux of the argument of the proponents of the bill that this country must keep itself prepared with large dyestuff plants in order to be ready at any time to manufacture war munitions and to put itself if that were possible upon a par with germany which has been in the lead of us all until recent years in the production of dyestuffs german chemistry appears to have been the terror of all those who had to contend with germany throughout the war in the manufacture of gases in th manufacture of high explosives in these and other war munitions the german chemists seemed to have had a hold upon the situation the german chemists had also gotten well into the industry in the united states and if the truth be known the german chemist is very strong with all the dye manufacturers of the united states today the statement made by the gentleman from michigan a few moments ago in reference to mr poucher is true before he became the representative of the du ponts before lie became powerful in the organization of what has become known as the american dyes institute a very small aggregation of men engaged in the manufacture of dyes he was the representative here of one of the greatest of the german concerns and had been so for many years and through the instrumentality of that concern had helped to introduce highgrade dyestuffs into the textile industries of the united states an effort was made during the war to catch up with the german chemists and it was more or less successful some of us who are older in the service here will recall in the discussion of the payne bill and the various underwood bills that much stress was laid upon the upbuilding of the dye industry in the united states and that much depended upon a concern conducted by the schoelkopf co at buffalo the demand for a protective tariff was due very largely to a desire to encourage the schoelkopf co there were other manufacturers in the united states but they were not strong relatively when the war broke out our former dependence upon the german dyestuffs was manifest we had been importing dyestuffs from switzerland we had been importing them from other countries but principally from germany and from switzerland germany was a great textile manufacturing country it was our greatest competitor in the production of hosiery and underwear although we had to contend very strongly with great britain which was strong in textile manufactures but not so strong in the manufacture of dyes entering into the textile trade many of our laws were intended to protect the manufacturer of the united states not only against the dyestuffs which were raw material entering into tlme fabric but against the textile product itself in clothing in woolens in worsteds in cotton in silk and other fabrics in shirtings underwear and hosiery our mills in the united states could not exist against the competition if germany and great britain and france and belgium and italy without protective tariffs we endeavored to prove this when the payne bill was passed it was denied as a political proposition by those who did not agree with the republicans in their economic beliefs but the passage of the underwood bills eventually proved that protection was necessary raw material would go from the united statesraw cotton for exampleinto europe principally into germany and great britain and would there be manufactured and dyed and sent back to the united states and it could be sent back and wassent back as finished product at a cost so far below that of the american cost considering the higher wages paid here and the greater overhead charges that it was absolutely necessary to maintain a protective tariff to preserve the industry in the united states textile manufacturers generally depend very largely upon the demand of the people for the styles or colors which they bring out what is popular this season is not popular next season the color that is used this year is not popular next year preparations must be made months ahead for the distribution of the product of the mill it may be that the taste of the good women who buy fabrics to work them up into dresses will run to blue or to gray or to polka dot or to any other color or style this year and that color or style will be utterly discarded next year color which attracts the eye enters ery largely into the saleability of the article fast colors of course are more valuable and important than colors that run and that show up the cheapness of the garment if you buy a necktie you want one that holds its color not on which when youget a little rain upon it ora little perspiration upon it will mark up the white shirt you wear the germans have had peculiar facility in preparing fast colorscolors that would hold that would be just as good when the garment was thrown into the scrap heap so far as the color itself was concerned as it was when it first entered into the fabric england was not very well fortified in the manufacture of dyestuffs england had been largely dependent upon the german chemists just as we had been but england had t lower wage scale than we had and as it was easier to obtain dyes from germany than it was for the manufacturers of the united states great britain had that advaitage over the united states in the matter of overhead and could make textiles cheaper than we could on account of the long training and routine service of the workmen she was able to turn out better goods sometimes than were turned out in the united states because of the changing conditions here but the war proved up the necessity of establishing an independent dye output in england and england proceeded at once after the war was declared in europe to attempt at least to make herself independent of germany in this respect large manufacturers in england operating under the board of trade which is substantially a government department were subsidized out of the british treasury and encouraged to establish dye works it is said that england today is fairly independent of germany and can take care of her own necessities with reference to dyestuffs in the united states we were worse off but our chemists were energetic they were ambitious to outwit the germans and do their part in a patriotic way they were industrios and they aided materially in the upbuilding of the industry in the united states their advancement in this regarrd can not be discounted the alien property custodian francis p garvan successor of a mitchell palmer the attorney general became one of the most active proponents of the dye industry in the united states and allied himself early with many of the chemists who were encouraging the manufacturers here i refer to him thus early in these remarks because lie is the author of the statement that we had built up the dye industry in the united states during the war until 400 000 000 was invested and until iliht 400 000 000 capital in dyestuffs served 3 000 000 000 worth of textile business i shall refer to mr garvan briefly a little later on the schoelkopf concern was the nucleus for the development of such dye industries as grew up here during the war there were several independent concerns around newark n 1 there was a buffalo plant and there was one plant down in tennessee they began to sell stock eventually there was a consolidation of most of those companies including the schoelkopf concern and they enlisted under the banner of the national aniline chemical co then the du ponts who were large manufacturers of powder and high explosives became interested in the manufacture of dyes and i think they also began to dispose of stock the stock of the national aniline lchemical co was on the market i think some of it is still upon the market and it may be that the istock dssued by these consolidated companies has something to do with the garvan estimate of 400 000 000 actually invested in dye enterprises now in the united states and 400 000 000 invested in the united states if it be invested and is a legitimate investment is about a standoff for the total amount said to be invested in the chemical industry in germany therefore if the statement of these gentlemen interested in the dye business be true with regard to assets liabilities and capital stock and stock put upon the market the united states today ought to be on even terms with the manufacturers of dyestuffs in germany subsidized though they may be although i doubt if they are now those of us who are opposing the licensing feature in this bill have no objection whatever to the rates fixed in the longworth bill which are in excess of the rates fixed in the existing law known as the hill bill when it passed the house we have no objection whatever to the xates we believe that these rates are not only sufficiently high to rotect everything that is manufactured in the united states in the way of dyestuffs but that they are positively prohibitive"], [0.9276649355888367, 0.9276649355888367, 0, "the president

true conditions he stated in the message that the daylightsaving law had given all but universal satisfaction you democrats who oppose us today concede that the president was misinformed when he wrote the text of that message but still you say he would veto it again in your zeal to protect the president from his manifest blunder perhaps you are unfair to him in your estimate of his character i have

power he had no chance to inform himself about the views of our people on this important question moreover in the abundance of his wisdom the president is not prone to seek advice from smaller minds i dare say no democrat in this house had the chance to advise him with regard to public sentiment on this matter and i am quite sure no republican could do it therefore it is not surprising that the president guessed wrong when he went in the face of public opinion in his veto statement ascribing universal popularity to the irksome unwieldy daylightsaving law but now he knows better the newspapers have informed him democratic and republican speeches printed in the record from a congress sent here by a wideawake national constituency have informed him petitions numbered by multiplied thousands have informed him no member on either side of this house will challenge my statement when i say that president wilson knows today what the people of america think about the daylightsaving

sent out by the republican organization throughout the great west and they told those people in that section that their interests as well as the interests of the country generally would be furthered and promoted by the election of republican representatives and of those who adhered to the republican faith but hardly had they gotten the dust brushed from the elephant that they used in the campaign before this influential member of the steering committee comes forward with the statement that we are to have a sectional control and by the geographical delineation which he utters he excludes all those people who live west of the mississippi river and south of the ohio from his charmed circle i am surprised that a man of the ability of the gentleman from illinois would take such a position i want to say here that i do not believe the south should control the affairs of this government although she has many brilliant men who are capable of doing anything that this government may need to have done i do not believe that the west should control this government although there are many men who have gone to reclaim that great country and to develop it and who tolling in its adverse possessions have grown strong in its sturdy environments and who are abundantly fitted to do their part and a large part in the future of this land of ours and neither do i believe that the people north of the ohio and east of the mississippi river should control this government but i believe that every man and every citizen of this great republic whether he be rich or poor or in moderate circumstances wherever he may live north or south east or west from lakes to gulf and from sea to sea should have an equal voice in the affairs of our common country that is the basis on which we have grown great i believe that the american people will indorse that sentiment everywhere now i do not begrudge that part of the country to which the gentleman from illinois refers its prosperity or its accomplishments but i do resent the statement that because of that prosperity or for any other reason it should have the exclusive control of the affairs of this nation now mr madden declared and i

contradictory and impossible of application as it was impossible to eat plenty of chicken without going out after dark in one breath he says he does not wish sectional legislation and in the next glories in the fact that he has calculated a way in which a section is to control it looks like an effort to polish over a viewpoint which should quicken his sense of shame i have no fears but that everyone will see through this thin veil of subterfuge i read again under democratic administration the south has been in the saddle and the south pays only 6 per cent of all the taxes as everyone knows many of the securities held in new york and other cities of the north and east have as their basis physical properties in the south and west and over the country generally and the incomes of the wealthy men in these cities are in a great measure derived from the country at large and from all sections of the united states in other words these concentrated profits are chiefly the product of the great industries throughout the nation and i deny the right of wealth anywhere to segregate itself and then upon the plea of segregation to exempt itself from its fair share of taxes when one considers the fact that many of the intangible securities of this country are held in the north and east and that these securities represent investments all over the nation and that the income from these nationwide activities flows into the commercial centers and when alongside this is placed the further fact that a great portion of the national revenue is derived from the income tax it will be readily seen that the mere percentage of taxes paid by any one portion of the country will not furnish a fair estimate either of the activities the industry the development or resources of the various sections i do not know and have not taken time to calculate the portion of the taxes that is paid by the south i know that whatever taxation has been levied in this country since i have been a member of congress and the only kind which could have been enacted under our constitution provided for a uniform application all over the country and if the south has paid only 6 per cent or any other percentage of the taxes of this country it is the souths misfortune and not the misfortune of that portion of the country to which the gentleman refers and if the west according to the gentlemans

confuted concisely and consummately by the disti guished gentleman from virginia judge saunders on this floor yesterday to imagine that the amendment itself contemplates this mnllification seems to me to simply arrive at that reductio ad absurdum abhorred eternally by all the law here are my reasons for favoring this bill first because i know that illinois does not want this debate to close without one illinois voice raised in favor of this bill in other words illinois does want to be heard by at least one voice in favor of the bill inasmuch as the only illinois voice thus far heard has been against the bill the voice of a chicago congressman illinois has spoken illinois has made plain its choice i know illinois i know it as well as any man in the state i know it well i take no back talk on that and i do not admit that chicago is wet in a fair fight i know tlat only 150 000 men and women voted antisaloon last april while 406 000 voted against chicago becoming antisaloon territory but i also know that while 400 000 thus in a way voted wet there was no fight and i know that there were 825 000 registered votersregistered for that electionand so that 425 000 either voted dry or did not vote at all and i know another thing for i know that william hale thompson was elected mayor of chicago april 5 1915 by 147 000 majority and i know that on october 10 1915 he ordered all the 7 700 saloons of chicago to be closed on sunday in order to comply with the old stat law of illinois something no other mayor ever had the nerve to do and everybody knows lie was reelected april 1 1919 by a rousing majority william hale thompsons opponent george sweitzer said the next day in an interview in the tribune the people in chicago seem to have approved of the administration of william hale thompson one of the first things this mayor did wa s to discover that no saloon had a right to open on sunday and he enforced his order and was reelected mayor of the city of chicago i t is fair to argue that mayor thompsons reelection was a ratification of his sundayclosing stand fully as fair as it is to parade the wet vote of that same dateapril 1 1919when the only question was whether saloon licenses should be issued from april 1 to june 30 just three months second because i know and know well the kind of citizensand aliensthat this law will have to deal with in illinois and i know and know well that the only way to make such people obey this law is to enforce it with a clubperform an operation with a clubjust as uncle sam had to operate with a club upon the skull of prussia in my earlier days i served six years as a prosecuting attorney four years as a judge four years as a united states collector of internal revenue with 100 men under meclerks deputies gaugers and storekeepersand later i held the pardoning power of a great state for four years as governor i know the various kinds of men who violata the law when i was united states collector of internal reienue collecting 1 2 000 000 a year from distillers brewers and wholesale and retail dealersnmore than any district in america except the peoria districti knew good men among the distillers and brewers i would trust some of them with my life my fortune and my sacred honor i am not talking about them i am talking about the violator he is the man this law must reachthe man this bill must deal withthe mean sneaky lawless man heeding no mans weakness and heeding no womans tears why should he heed his countrys constitution or laws he will not unless le has to this law must have teeth and plenty of them you can not charm a hyena with kindness third because i know the laboring man of illinois i enjoy his confidence and i know that i yes i represented him when i urged and passed the illinois convictlabor law and other laws i represented him then and i do now samuel gompers does not i know that i am representing him now as to prohibition as i stand here in my place in this house and that samuel gompers does not inasmuch as he has in recent days repeatedly and persistently given out the impression that the organized labor of america will seek and does seek either bolshevism or beera misrepresentation of organized labor i have not his exact words but i will insert them in the record why samuel gompers once ordered that hon lawrence y sherman be defeated and l y sherman was elected and reelected and is united states senator today and samuel gomper once ordered that hon joseph g cannon of illinois be defeated and when he got through beating uncle joe well uncle joe usually romps home with about 5 000 majority but that time his majority was nearer 10 000 this morning in the congressional library i took down what he aid from the chicago tribune of november 5 1886 that paper on that date quoted mr gompers as saying if these men are executed it would simply give an impetus to the socalled revolutionary movementthose are very familiar words are they not they are very nearly the same words that he is quoted as using today i repeat what lie says if these men are executed it would simply give an impetus to the socalled revolutionary movement which no other thing on earth can do these men would apart from any consideration of mercy of humanity be looked upon as martyrs 1lr chairman i represent 1 330 000 families in the state of illinois 1 330 000 but i do not go around bragging about it and i do not pretend that i can control them all but we have heard this same thing again and again which i now quote further frorai mr gomperss words thousands and hundreds of thousands of laboring men all over the country would consider that those men had been executed because they were standing up for free speech and free assemblage we ask you sir to interpose your great power and prevent so dire a calamity of course no one accuses mr gompers of favoring dynamite the tribune says further mr gompers closed by saying the throwing of the bomb had destroyed the ighthour movement that was a mistake it did not destroy it of course i do not charge and neither did the tribune that mr gompers advocatel or favored the throwing of bombs the point i make is that he mr gompers when the red flag of anarchy was about to b buried 6 feet below the soil of illinois tried to inject the labor problem into a problem it did not belong to and lie made a mistake in so doing he is making the same mistake now he is trying to inject the labor problem into this prohibition problem where it does not belong no dire calamity happened then the eighthour law did go through the laboring men of america did not rebel or resort to revolution then and they will not do it now fourth because i know the illinois that has gone dry in nearly all its counties nearly all its cities and nearly all its townshipsthe illinois which again and again returned to the legislature a dry majority sending dry men back again and again and sending to the general assembly convening last january a big majority to ratify the national prohibition amendment january 14 1919is still dry fifth because we must show our teeth unless we use force without stint this will be a peace without victory it will after all the effort and struggle and prayers and tears of the years be a barren victory be a result gratifying to nobody but the kaiser and all others wishing the failure of the american experiment in free government what an appalling humiliation and mortification to win the world war and then lose after all by destroying americas youth by a law with no teeth there must be no turning back by congress now in deference to the alluring cry of fairness fairness is unknown to the citizens and aliens who will be the violators of this law there is not a fair bone in their bodies they do not know what fairness means they are strangers to fairness and leniency and mercy each is a tyrant when on top and a whiner when the under dog there is not a true sportsman a deadgame sport in all

legislation i think it will lead to inefficiency instead of efficiency i believe that it is absolutely impossible for any one committee however able it may be thoroughly and fully and completely to investigate all of the various appropriations from the multiplied angles that they are presented for consideration and the result will be that the committee will be divided into a large number of

have any prussianism in it and left our government a civil government i do not think the gentleman from tennessee should overlook a measure of this kind in discussing what congress has or has not done the first message this congress had from the chief executive asked us to repeal the then wartime prohibition on wine and beer this in the face of the fact that a suffi cient number of states had adolpted the eighteenth amendment which clearly made it ourduty to pass a permanent national prohibition law instead of repealing any of the then existing laws congresss answer to that message was no but on the other hand wepassed the volstead law a permanent national bonedry prohibition law true the president vetoed this law and true congress had to pass it over his veto but this is as it should be the president has always been against prohibition the republicah party has been for it and the record is now correct it shows the truth and future generations should know the truth i can not refrain here from telling you a true joke that i know will sound like a fairy story the democratic state con vention which met last month in my home state at wichita kans in their tesolutions pointed with pride to the fact that under a democratic president we had obtained national prohi bition these resolutions said nothing of its being a law over the protest and veto of the president these same resolutions did however indorse the succession of the soninlaw to the throne this congress found tfe railroads operated by the government the rates as high or higher than ever known in history many many men drawing from 15 000 to 25 000 a year in the railroad administration most of these men had no qualifications except that they were deserving democrats half of them would not know a switch frog from a bull frog some were no doubt there to keep from going to war some had been defeated for congress many were distantly related by blood or marriage to some of the highups but they were all getting pay for their part in demoralizing the railroads and business one of the first things i did was to try to get a harvest rate for the farmers one of these golfplaying high brows made a statement to me of onehalf hour that according to his view of economics this would not do the next morning i saw in the papers where he had put in a onehalf rate to points such as atlantic city i was angry i went to see him again i will not repeat what i said he ordered me out now he is out but he and his kind stayed long enough to cost this govern nient 1 500 000 000 this at a time when every

have happened if they had indulged in their mismanagement for a reasonable number of hours we have turned the roads back to their owners i will not take time to go into detail on that law but it is a good one and in time under it we will get back to normal it would take a week to enumerate the outrages this crowd committed while they held the roads every man knows enough to keep any man talking a whole day gompers who misrepresents labor on all occasions says we are a no congress and i admit we have had to say no to the old gentleman several times the first time i ever heard him was on the capitol steps talking to the crowd of mostly foreigners who demanded that we nullify the eighteenth amendment instead of passing a prohibition law i heard him say that day that if we did not repeal prohibition his followers would ignore the law of course congress said no then i heard him advocate the plumb plan and again we had to say no but while i could spend a day on the things we have had to say no to gompers on we have said yes where justice spoke i must not discuss here in detail all the things we have said yes to but let me mention a few in passing any one of which one could make a whole speech about first the american people asked for a reduction in appropriations we gave them economy this congress passed the budget law the most forward step for economic government in a century the leasing bill one of the most constructive pieces of legislation passed by any congress the waterpower bill important in its section the cold storage bill the sweet bill for soldiers of the late war the fuller pension bill for the benefit of the soldiers of the civil war the sells pension bill forthe relief of the soldiers of the war with spain the philippine insurrection and the china relief expedition i know that some good business men are wondering why this congress does not repeal more tax lawsand i notice mr mcadoo is advocating something of that kind some of us can remember how in 1916 the congress repealed some revenue measures on the eve of a presidential election right in the face of a deficiency that was a democratic demagogue congress that act was a political one now everyone knows we have to have money to pay expenses and to cover democratic deficiencies true republicans and democrats do now and al ys have disagredd as to how to raise that money we have not a twothirds majority even in the house we have a free trader for an executive and more than onethird of the house is made up of free traders to repeal tax laws and not arrange for the revenue by other laws would be hypocrisy of the worst type the revenue laws republicans believe in would be fought hard in both branches of congress and vetoed at the white house everyone in congress regardless of politics admits we would be wasting our time in trying to pass these laws over the veto the republican party was successful in keeping downgov ernment expensesand taxes in the past wait until that

desire during the time at my disposal to speak of the tree as a living thing to show something of its vital relation to human life to the man who is familiar with tree life it might seem almost superfluous to emphasize the fact that a tree lives and iet the average man unfortunately looks upon the tree as an inanimate and more or less useful accident on the face of the earth and yet the tree lives it breathes it has a real circulation the tree digests its food and assimilates it it has sexual processes that are just as real and beautiful as in any other form of life it has the power to adapt itself to its environmeat to be sure it lacks intelligence and a nervous system and the power of locomotion but in all the other elemental processes the tree functions just as truly as man himself the tree breathes through the leaves chiefly and to a small extent through the tiny lenticelb3 in the young bark the air is taken into the leaf in just as real a sense as it is taken into the human lungs it enters through the many microscopic openings on the underside of the leaf there on the inside of the leaf the elements of the air are separated the carbon is absorbed and is used in the building process the oxygen is given off again to enrich the air for the benefit of all animal life the circulation in the tree is just as real as in the human body it does not move so fast nor move round and round in response to heart action yet it does move and goes from the tiniest root hairs way down underground up to the leaves and back again all the way to the roots again on the upward flow the circulation proceeds through the sapwood traveling from cell to cell from the small roots to the large ones into the trunk and from there to the large branches and then through the smaller ones to the leaves from the leaf where it undergoes the necessary chemical change to transform it into tree food it travels downward through the cells of the inner bark all the way to the smallest roots building the cambium layer as it goes the digestive processes of the tree take place in the leaf there the crude food material brought up from the roots in the sap is spread out among the tiny cells of the marvelous leaf structure and under the influence of the sunlight is combined with the carbon extracted from the air and is transformed into tree fooddigested as we call it in animal life this digested tree food is assimilated into the entire growing parts of the tree in the downward flow through the cells of the inner bark from which the cambium layer is built and all growth takes place the sexual processes of the tree are fundamentally the same as elsewhere in living things the male and female exist as positive factors sometimes the male and female exist in the amine flower many times they exist in different flowers in the sametree in a few cases all the flowers of a tree are entirely male or entirely female the pollen is created in the male and is carried by insects or birds and in a vast number of cases by the wind to the female portion of the flower or to the female flower there itfertilizs and produces the seed which nature designed to reproduce its kind the tree adapts itself to its environment to an amazing degree where trees a e thick they grow tall to reach the sunlight where two or more trees grow close together it grows on one side to accommodate its fellows when it grows in rocks it sends its roots into almost impossible places in search of food and anchorage it often sends its roots hundreds of feet in search of water and the roots travel back fad forth among the many obstacles toward their destination all life has two primal purposes of existenceone is selfpreservation and the other is reproduction the tree subscribes to both and is governed by both it undergoes a constant battle for life from the time of its advent until the end it must battle against the tremendous winds against drought against insect enemies and deadly diseases and now it must battle against man himself who is the most destructive the most thoi ghtless and inconsiderate enemy that the tree has encoun tered indeed it has a lifelong struggle for selfpreservation its lchemne of reproduction is the same elemental plan of sex attratction that makes possible the continuity of all life the leaf is probably the most wonderful and is certainly the most vital and indispensable factor in the world of living things without the leaf all life must perish it is the one and only connecting link between the organic and inorganic worlds it is the only thing capable of transforming the various mineral elements into available food material for both plant and animal the only minerals that man can take into his systerm and use are water and salt but he can use only a limited quantity of these every other element of food must come to him either directly or indirectly through the leaf every grain every fruit every vegetable food product every foot of lumber and every other vegetable product that is used for the pleasure and profit of man is made in the leaf and thus we see that the great god who created the world and the life that inhabits it made of the lowly leaf the greatest and most wonderful instrumentality of that life perhaps the most insidious and persistent enemy of the tree is the group of diseases called fungi which attack any exposed portion of woody tissues and start to grow by consuming the wood cells a fungus disease exists in a decaying treeit produces the decay at the proper time in the growing season the fungus produces a fruiting body or bodies these produce their fruit in due time which are called spores these spores light in weight and microscopic in size are given off in myriads and are carried by the winds and sometimes otherwise to the adjacent vegetation most of them fail harmless but some of them find lodgmnent in a wound where the protecting bark has been removed there in the exposed woody tissues the microscopic fungus spore starts to grow sending out little threadlike tentacles from cell to cell and breaking them down the fungus is a parasitea low form of vegetable life it lives by destroying some other form of life that which attacks the living tree destroys the interior cells and persists until the tree is consumed what we call decay is only the result of an active disease which consumes the woody interior that constitutes the structural strength of the tree the interior of a tree is often referred to as the beart or heartwood this conveys an entirely wrong impression the vital parts of a tree are the leaves nd roots the bark and cambium and outer lqyers of sapwood it is the outside layers of sapwood which are most active and each succeeding layer inward toward the center becomes less and less active until those near the center become practically dormant this gives the reasons for the development of tree surgeons and the science of tree surgery the disease creates decay against which the tree unaided is helpless it is the function of the tree surgeon to do for the tree what the denitist does for the teeth and the surgeon does for the human body in the practice of his art li must remove the decay disinfect to prevent further decay thoroughly waterproof to protect the exposed wood put in place various kinds and forms of mnechanical bracing often complicated and always ingenious prepare the cavity so that the filling will remain permanently in place and then fill with skill and precision so that the filling will become a permanent part of tha tree water and all foreign substance must be excluded the filling must be cleverly built up in sections somewhat like the backbone in the human bodyin order to permit a reasonable movement between the sections in the swaying and twisting of the tree in heavy winds nature rewards the skill of human hands by the gradual healing of the bark over the filling i can not pass this interesting science of tree preservation without paying a little tribute to jahn davey the nature lover and creative genius who gave to the world an invaluable science which he called tree surgery it represents his love it is the product of his life of service it wxvs born of his faith and determination it is the result of his consecration to a great purpose his contribution to the race of which he is happy to be a part

control this body are we to concur in senate amendments without knowing anything about them simply because some man of another legislative body said he wanted it it gets my goat"],

interest charge on that sum including the sinking fund amounts to 1 250 000 000 a year we have loaned the governments of europe 10 000 000 000 and they have not paid a dollar of interest nobody knows when they will the business people of the united states have shipped goods abroad for which they have taken the paper of european purchasers to the amount of 12 000 000 000 that is already discounted in american banks and that is not being paid when it becomes due and now we propose in effect through the government of the united states for that is what it meansto advance another billion dollars to lay another charge upon the backs of the american people for that amount i understand that next week a proposition is to be presented to the house to loan germany a billion dollars to buy goods in america what you do by the passage of this resolution is to take the money out of the treasury of the united states in effect and pay europeans for goods purchased in america and then come back to the american people who have shipped the goods and others of the american people and ask them to buy the paper so that when they ship their goods and receive the pay they will be compelled in order to sustain this institution to buy the paper that has been issued as a result of the sale of the goods the time has come when we must stop this artificial stabilization and let nature take its course if you are going to do this for the farmer and the cotton grower what are you going to do with the men whose wages all over the country have been reduced about 221 per cent i do not see any reduction coming in the prices they are compelled to pay for what they have to buy are you trying to reduce the cost of living today while they are idle oh no you are trying to stabilize prices and that will compel them to pay the high prices that now obtain but you are not guaranteeing them any employment not at all factories are closing right anl left why are they closing the values of the commodities of the factories of the country have fallen nobody knows what their value is the people who own these factories are seeking no legislation are they they are willing to permit the economic conditions to control you are undertaking artificially to stabilize and keep prices up when everybody in the united states wants prices to come down they are coming down whatever you do this legislation is not going to help the situation at all except to the extent that it adds new obligations on the treasury of the united states and thereby adds to the necessity of increasing the taxation on the backs of

personally we questioned i think it was the clerk of the court of appeals when he was before the committee as to what space was available in the building and then i have here a letter from mr woods superintendent of the united states capitol building and grounds and it is my recollection that the building was constructed under his direction in the letter he states addressing the chairman of the subcommittee in response to inquiry from the appropridtion committee i beg to inform you that it is feasible to construct quarters in the court of appeals building for the accommodation of the recorder of deeds that would mean the construction of offices in the attic story of the huiling and afford approximately 6 000 square feet of office space in addition to this there is considerable accommodation for the storage of records in the cellar story of this building as the latter space was originally constructed for that purpose i think that the recorder could be fully accommodated by this method perhaps the gentleman would like the full statement of mr w oods and i will read the balance of the letter although the part i have read immediately refers to his inquiry jib says in this connection i desire to tell you that this matter has bees before the committee two or three times prior to this date the last estimate for the purpose was made on january 20 1919 in a letter addressed to the late hon thomas s martin chairman of the senate committee on appropriations the cost then stated was 18 000 a copy of this letter i hereto attach i have revised this estimate necessarily on account of the advanced price of labor and material and must tell you that the present figure would reach 22 000 and that would mean the most economical construction possible i would like to call your attention to the fact that the lease of the building now occupied by the recorder of deeds expires on june 30 next if my understanding is correct therefore if it is the intention of your committee to make this appropriation and provide for the recorder of deeds in the court of appeals building by that date i would suggest that it he so made as early as possible and that a provision be placed thereon making it immediately available"], [0.0005972981452941895, 0.5005972981452942, 1, "i object i will not object if the other bill is taken up first"], [0.0006717443466186523, 0.5006717443466187,

by some person who hopes to find dynamite in the bill i want to vote for this measure but i want it amended so i will not be criticized in the future if something should arise which would show that the government had not been properly dealt with and that the government had been called upon to pay out a sum of money that was not just and correct for this reason i hope that the chairman will be
