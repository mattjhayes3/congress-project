transportation facilities i came here with a charge from my people to ignore all bosses set aside all dictation and demand legislation which should not by implication not by construction but by express terms regulate railroads warehouses terminal facilities private car lines and everything used in connection with the transportation of the products of the people i came here with that commlission from the people what should i have done with it should i have gone to the speaker and said what do you wish me to do why i bore a commission from my people who told me what to do what was it sir it was that i should seek not partial but complete legislation upon this important subject it was that i should seek to have private cars regulated along with the other evils of which the people complained i shall raise no question of veracity here between me and another member as to what happened in a caucus what is a caucus it is a conference its determination could not come between me and my oath to my god it did not then and as god helps me it never shall come between me and the voice of the people who sent me here whose servant am i that of the people of mississippi no sir i am the servant of the sovereign people of the eighth district of missouri their commands i shall obey at all times the man who would set up a barrier between me and the desire of my people i would refer to the happy hunting ground where george cox the cincinnati boss has gone and where other bosses must eventually go no man can say that i violated that caucus without uttering an unmitigated falsehood the caucus simply declared that it indorsed the provisions of the davey bill the bill i reported contained every provision of the davey bill and not one word in conflict with it i am condemned because i reported the hearst bill who is mr hearst a tall stalwart man who sits over here from one of the new york districts a handsome man who possesses youth and modesty of demeanor i have very little acquaintance with him i am told he has large fortune and i know he has ample ability and i commend him that unlike most sons of wealth he is devoting the golden fortunes which have come to him and the splendid talents with which god has endowed him to enlightening and making better the world in which he lives the hearst bill arrested my attention because it provided in express terms for the regulation of private cars and private car lines the classification of freights for the regulation of warehouses terminals and terminal facilities i found it was the kind of a bill my people desired me to support i found also that there was not a line not a letter of it that was in conflict with what was done at the caucus i reported the bill but suppose a midnight caucus had declared for one thing and my people demanded another what should i have done back in missouri that question needs no answer the eschtownsend bill contained no express provision for regulating private car lines neither did the davey bill the president who assumes to be leading the fight for rate regulation approved the eschtownsend bill but time has passed and i find by referring to the message sent to this session of congress that he has seen light last session the bill which did not regulate private car lines met his approval but now public opinion has driven him around to the provisions of the heargt bill on this subject i quote his message all private car lines industrial roads refrigerator charges and the like shouldbe expressly put under the supervision of the interstate commerce commission mark the word expressly the president has come around to the hearst bill i want to say for the edification of the gentleman from mississippi that he has not appointed on the committee any man who will have the hardihood to report out a bill which shall omit these provisions in express terms i challenge the gentleman to stand upon this floor now and say thnt he is not in favor of putting into the bill in express terms the regulation of private car lines yet if we are to believe what we read i am to be condemned for doing that thing for doing that i am to have written across my brow by him who assumes to be leader the words thou are weighed and found wanting and sent back to my people to apologize to them for having offended greatness we talk of leaders god alimghty makes leaders a democratic caucus never undertook to make one and whoever adorns his brow with a coronet and gets astfide a stick horse and struts into this chamber shouting i am leader does that which no democratic caucus has ever yet commissioned anybody to do i will tell you who is a leader he is a man whose doctrines are so sound whose declarations are so clear and whose heart is so bold that all must follow himnot under the lash of a boss but because their hearts and their consciences constrain them we all sit in this chamber coordinate leaders bound by nothing but the oath we take to our maker and the voice of the people who sent us here i want to say that the voice of the eighth district of missouri is not to be stifled by the voice of the eighth district of mississippi as long as i am a member of this house i shall boldly assert the dignity and the sovereignty of the district which i represent they say i have been transferred from a committee why because i insisted on putting into express terms provision for the regulation of private car lines this is not the first time i have seen the gentleman lead at the st louis convention i saw him lead through a slaughterhouse into an open grave now i have gotten away from what i intended to say there is the hearst bill which i reported into this house at the last session it was not voted upon but nearly every democrat who spoke expressed regret that it was not why was it not voted upon did not these stalwart democrats desire to honestly represent their constituents the voice of a leadera bosskept them from it is that the way business is to be transacted here am i to cringe before the man who has no other authority than that which he falsely assumes and ask favors at his hands a leader our captain was as brave a lad as eer commission bore all brightly shone his new tin sword a paper cap he wore he comes to ride me down for what because i refused to be dictated to by a boss and insisted on carrying out the will of the people who sent me here the gentleman will continue to come here from the eighth district of mississippi some other than i may come from the eighth district of missouri the gentleman may sit in the cloakroom and boast of his conquests while i plow corn on some hillside farm back in missouri but the waters that leap from the top of the ozarks into the osage in my district are not freer now than i shall be free all the days of my public life from the dictation of any boss defy i did not defy any caucus everything the caucus recommended was in absolute accord with my views in absolute accord with the views of my people and with the terms of the bill i reported but if you should hold a midnight caucus and pass a gag rule get the recognition of the chair yield time to whom you will stifle the voice of every man of your party except him whom you choose to hear and in one short hour bring out of that midnight meeting that of which there isno report no record nothing but the veracity of gentlemen to be relied upon to state what there occurred put that between me and my duty to my constituents and i will defy it i will defy every boss who puts his will above the will of the people whose agent i am why is it that we do not have legislation here why sir we all know how it is done we report a bill and the committee on rules sees to it that we do not get a vote on it they say to you republicans dont be scared we will fix it so your record will be all right so you can go back to your constituents and say you would have voted for the hearst bill if you had had an opportunity and our leader helps it along on the principles of tickle me joey oh tickle medo you tickle me and ill tickle you why is it that not a member of this house is recorded as voting for or against the regulation of private car lines because the bosses would not permit it what is there in the aspect of this young man hearst that so excites the alarm of some here i will tell you he has advocated some things that the people are for and there be those interests in this country which employ other than direct methods to prevent that which the people desire one way to stifle rate legislation is to deflect it the easiest method of doing it is for some leader to come in and say gentlemen it can not all be done at once we must take one step at a time we will leave private car linesfor another bill the president now says that all private car lines should be expressly put under the supervision of the interstate coinmerce commission that is what was said last session in the bill which mr lamar and i reported a vote was not allowed upon it then everybody is for it now the people have been heard from and we shall find that the gentleman from mississippi will not be bold enough to go back to his people and say that he opposed regulating private cars iii express terms the gentleman from mississippi says he always was in favor of regulating private cars but i am from missouri and must be shown it is not enough to tell me about it leader i will tell you of a leader i saw him walk into the convention at chicago in 1896 with his credentials questioned i saw him come into that convention later with thit platform into which was written the thoughts on rate regulation of that wise sage ofitexas judge reagan that convention put into his hands the banner of democracy on which was inscribed the demand for rate regulation theodore roosevelt opposed him the bosses opposed him the mccalls and the mccurdys opposed him the corporations opposed him but tie people as one man arose and followed him and william jennings bryan would have been carried into the presidency if boodle had not controlled instead of ballots that sir is a leader not one who goes down at midnight into the dark recesses of a chamber where the curtains are pulled down and reporters ejected and evolves something which can be reported only from the memory of men and undertakes to use that to coerce others but one who abides in the hearts of the people and is followed because they believe in him and love him oh the little triumphs that come to men i submit to the gentleman from mississippi two qualities which a leader should not possessvanity and vindictiveness those are qualities which should inhabit the breast of no man who would lead his fellows i would not inflict injury upon the railroads the greatest instrument of advancement and civilization of the amercan people is its system of railroads he who with reckless hand shall lay any improper burden upon the railroads will be placing that burden upon the shoulders of the people the railroads can not be improperly subjected to the payment of a farthing that is not a tribute levied on the people themselves they can not be harrassed with sinister legislation without injury to the country all we ask is that the people shall have fair play as the president puts it give all an equal opportunity i commend the president for the utterance of that sentiment and all honor to him for drawing his inspiration from the utterances of the greatest living democrat in his speech accepting his first nomination mr bryan said our campaign has not for its object the reconstruction of society we can not insure to the vicious the fruits of a virtuous life we would not invade the home of the provident to supply the wants of the spendthrift we do not propose to transfer the rewards of industry to the lap of indolence property is and will remain the stimulus to endeavor and the compensation for toil we believe as asserted in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal but that does not mean that all men are or can be equal n possessions in ability or in merit it simply means that all shall stand equal before the law i assert that property rights are safe in the hands of the common people that is a fair statement of the principles upon which tie people would act in the regulation of railroad rates they would not destroy but they will control when we look back at the contests waged by mr bryan for regulation of railroads we fin1 much to encourage us there are those now leading the fight for regulation who 6pposed him in 1896 1900 and 1904 aye even the strenuous roosevelt fought us and our policies in all of those campaigns we on this side sometimes become despondent because we are in the minority let us take courage and be of good cheer we may not get the postoffices but by the grace of god we will get rate regulation we have fought the republicans on that issue for twelve yearsor rather they have fought us they have seemed to win and we to lose but it is not so the very declarations of our platforms in 1896 1900 and 1904 will in this year of our lord be written into a bill which shall pass this house we shall win and the people get that for which we fought we hear much of the leadership of mr roosevelt in the matter of rate regulation yes he leads but as a stag leads the hounds or as a ship lealds the storm he leads in flight for safety from the indignation of the people aroused to a sense of their wrongs by the bold leadership of mr bryan and his fellows let us take courage from the example of that great apostle of democracy that uncrowned king anointed with the benedictions of every man who loves human liberty it is not necessary that we should be in the majority to triumph

matter that i sent to the desk not being considered in the nature of privilege by the speaker i naturally desisted in the colloquy which ensued between the leader of the minority on this side of the house and myself he suggested that in the interest of party harmony i should not pursue a discussion which he evidently saw i intended to pursue were the time allowed me now i will accord to the gentleman that respect as a party leader which i have heretofore accorded to him personally but which until he as i conceive relieves me of an unjust charge on his part i will always concede him as a party leader hereafter but which under no circumstances could i concede to him personally i shall not indulge in any personalities on this occasion nor do i agree with the leader of the minority of this house that if i did so it would please any republicans upor the other side i do not believe that there is a man of any sense or sensibility in this house be he republican or democrat who would take any pleasure in a discussion in this house of a highly personal character in the heat of debate acrid colloquies and controversies will sometimes occur but sir it is bad enough if those happen between political opponents and even then when the time has passed that aroused the feeling it should subside no man of generous instincts should cherish a revengeful feeling and certainly i do not therefore i say i do not think that the republican side of this house would be amused at anything that i might say personally against the minority leader and 1 will suggest to the leader of the minority that he would be in a much more fortunate position to suggest party harmony to me had he as the leader of this side of the house set the precedent i shall alludeto a controversy on the floor of this house between the gentleman from mas~achusetts and the gentleman from new york i had nothing to do with that controversy i stated on the floor of this house that i would not be bound by the personal controversies in this house and i will not be these are matters that gentlemen must settle for themselves this house and the public will judge according to the merits and not upon the rashness of speech of any one member of the house the leader of this house because he is an elected leader should have set a magnanimous example every man who heard the gentleman from massachusetts arraign the gentleman from new york will concede that it was donei will not say in a vicious manner because i will not reflect upon the gentleman from massachusettswill testify that it was done in a terrific manner where was our distinguished leader on that occasion it was democrat to democrat why did not he stop that deliberated and prepared attack the gentleman from massachusetts made no concealment of his purpose le gave notice of arising to a question of personal privilege days in advance it was in the air here the morning he made his arraignment in the house of the gentleman from new york that he would do it and if i am not mistaken the gentleman from massachusetts arose and with typewritten manuscript in his hands made a deliberate and prepared attack he did it openly he gave a blow and received a blow on this occasion i will do nothing to disturb the harmony of this side of the ilouse i shall certainly not contribute if i can hell it to any amusement on the part of the republicans a distinguished republican representative in this house was standing near me on this side of the house when the gentleman from massachusetts made that arraignment of the gentleman from new york i did not see him amused he did not smile he did not say a word i think sir he felt a sense of sorrow to see men divided who in the natural order of things would be united certainly it would not please me to see an acrimonious debate between two republicans of this house i do not want to do anything here that my party colleagues will charge or my people in florida might think contributed to democratic discord in the face of political opponents but i desire very briefly to allude to certain occurrences in this house upon public legislation and certain matters that do not appertain thereto except in a collateral manner one of the most important questionsthe one which the president lays down in his message as the great and almost supreme questionis the subject of national transportation this house deals only with national transportation this house has the power under the federal constitution to regulate all public highways of national character i speak more particularly of the interstate railroads a railroad charge is as directly a tax upon the products and business earnings of a community and country as though it were laid directly by legislative authority in the form of a governmental support tax therefore any charge that is too high is unreasonable any device of extorting money or extracting money out of the individual that should not exist is against public policy and these devices according to the presidents message and the reports of the interstate commerce commission are many and varied therefore this question is a very great question it is to be presumed that every member of this house will furnish to this house and to the country every single particle of information he may possess upon this great question his party is entitled to it the country is entitled to it i care not whose bill comes before this house whether it is a bill of a republican or a democrat it is entitled to receive consideration from each member of this house regardless of party it is not a mere personal measure it is a public measure it is not here that one particular man shall be shelved or put aside in this ilouse a measure of legislation proposed by each member is to go to the proper committee to be properly considered and reported upon to this house to be properly debated in no other way shape or form can a public measure of proposed legislation come before the house the house and the country are entitled and ought to have an intelligent knowledge of that measure now at the last session of the fiftyeighth congress this house passed the bill known as the eschtownsend bill to regulate interstate railroad rates a substitute measure was proposed on this side of the house called the davey bill that substitute was voted down immediately or shortly thereafter the vote was had upon the main question the the majority report from the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and the eschtownsend bill as reported was passed the democrats voted with the republicans in its favor except possibly half a dozen now there is a history behind the davey bill the democratic caucus bill which i propose to submit fairly and temperately to this house and if i make an error i trust the distinguished leader of the minority on this side will correct me i do not intend to do him the slightest injustice knowingly and it will only be sufficient for him to point out my mistake for me to withdraw it the republicans of this house in reporting the eschtownsend bill to the house proceeded in the ordinary regular course of legislation the committee on interstate and foreign commerce dealt with that measure the republican majority of it formulated a bill submitted that bill to their caucus it was duly approved under caucus regulations and then was formally introduced into this house and passed as a piece of republican legislation but was that the history of the davey bill it can not be held that in my alluding to these matters that i am transgressing any bounds of propriety that might restrict me to silence what was done in that caucus went to the press and the country the caucus upon that occasion adopted what was known as the davey bill it comprehended but two sections the first gave to the interstate commerce commission the mere power upon complaint made to revise an unreasonable rate and to substitute in lieu thereof a reasonable rate that that rate go into effect until upon review it was re versed by the courts the second section of the bill provided merely the machinery for taking an appeal from the order of the interstate commerce commission to the higher courts of the land that was the sum total of the davey bill when that bill reached the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and after the republican members of that committee had formulated the eschtownsend bill and had adjourned to give the democrats on that committee a chance to formulate their bill and report it what did the democratic minority of that committee do it added five sections to that davey bill what further happened i voted for every one of those five sections added to that bill i joined with the democrats of that committee in formally reporting that bill to this house favorably but i did something else besides that i did that which i thought and knew that i had the liberty to do i reported in a subsidiary manner the gentleman from missouri joining with me what was known as the hearst bill to this house and that which i would have liked to substitute for the davey bill as practically my choice of bills had i the power to enact it into law those were my views upon that bill then they are my views now and until i see some bill introduced by the leader of the minority some democraton this side or some republican on time other side which i believe to be a more comprehensive measure of legislative reform upon the present existing railway abuses i shall continue to think was far and away the best bill introduced into this house upon the subject of railwayrate abuses and providing remedies for the same now i submit it to the minority leader and to the house that whenever a caucus adopts a bill it can not be added to in the slightest particular it would be a contradiction in terms as we understand the caucus rules to say that a caucus could adopt a bill and promulgate it and bind the members of that caucus to it and then that any committee or anybody else could add to it why sir the authority that made that caucus the authority that limited the power of that committee or any member of this house to touch this bill was supreme and controlling until the authority that made it had dissolved and annulled it it needs no argument to establish that proposition now what occurred when that bill built up from two sections to seven came before this house the leader of the minority upon the floor of this house in the latter stages of the debate was driven to the alternative of seeing that democratic measure of proposed relief go out to the country patently imperfect incomplete unless he attempted to add to it and amend it and on the floor of this house the minority leader asked by grace of the republicans that which he might have placed in his bill in a democratic caucus that which the republican president recommended in his messagethat the private car lines and terminal fees iniquities be corrected by legislation and that he be allowed to amend the already enlarged davey bill by adding amendments to that effect his request was for unanimous consent to add these amendments and the gentleman from wisconsin promptly turned him down by objecting now i make this point andi make it with the leader of the minority on this floor before the members of this house and in the eyes of the country namely if that caucus was binding if the terms of that caucus limited every democrat to that bill and nothing else then i challenge him as a lawyer as a candid frank debater whether or not he could have asked for those amendments on the floor of the house or whether on the committee we could have added to that caucus bill i care not how men may argue or trim around that point it is incontrovertible that in the matter of a caucus bill nobody could touch it until it was altered by another caucus i submit it to the memory of my party colleagues as to whether or not i did not raise the question on the floor of the caucus that that measure would not do for me stating that i couldnot go back to my state upon so limited a series of remedies if i mistake not the adequacy of the caucus bill was challenged by half a dozen members of that caucus and it was the absolute understanding when the caucus adjourned that the provisions of the davey bill were adopted to only signify to the country that the democrats of this house were willing to put in a bill the great and important feature of rate revising and rate fixing and that was all and that any democrat in this house or any member of that committee could contribute of his own knowledge and experience whatever it might be to the perfecting of a bill to come before this house eventually if that is not correct then i am the most mistaken man that ever attended a caucus i state the matter correctly i submit it to the memory of the democrats of this house who attended the caucus it came up for discussion i rose in my place with the few minutes of time allowed me and stated to the caucus distinctly that with a republican president pronouncing forcibly upon this great question it would not do for the democrats to limit themselves to too brief a measure and that so far as my state was concerned it demanded far more extensive remedial legislation than was contained in the twosection davey bill i submit it to the memory of my colleagues now so much for the public phase of this question now sir there is a personal phase to this matter which i will touch upon without any feeling i do it in justice to myself i do it in justice to my reputation i do it in justice to my character what democrat can object to that what republican can object to that it is well known and is now a matter of record that i am not and will not be in the future a member of the committee of interstate and foreign commerce i am not challenging upon this occasion the power of the minority leader to make that change i do not challenge his right in fact i think he should have that power i think he should have that right if the speaker would concede to him the power of appointing and would not concede also the power of removal it would be dividing his power as a leader of this house he ought to have the power of reorganizing those committees i do not make any question of that i make no challenge of that there are limitations however not binding upon the minority leader in themselves there are moral limitations upon him there is an honorable limitation upon him as binding as if nominated in the bond and what is that that he must take the power and responsibility which the speaker gives him and exercise it with wisdom justice and moderation upon his followers on the floor of this house his brother democrats his peers in everything that constitutes manhood or anything else i say it is as binding upon him as though the speaker had written it in the power conferred upon him now sir i submit it to this house that my removal from that committee has been done by a man whom i have held as my friend a man for whom three years ago i voted for as party leader against my distinguished friend from missouri and i voted for him upon a sentiment and upon a ground that touched me very closely when i explained this to my friend from missouri he very kindly released me and i voted for the gentleman from mississippi so bir chairman there is nothing personal that i have against the minority leader i have not the slightest feeling against him with the exception that i feel a just sense of indignation not of hate anger or revenge at what i consider an injustice and indignity done against me upon the part of the minority leader i acknowledge that i was honored when i first came here in a larger manner than i deserved but not altogether by our party leader i owed my appointment to the resignation from the interstate and foreign commerce committee of hon robert w davis of florida in my favor had the minority leader given me that place of his own accord over men who had been here long years before me some one else would have suffered an injustice i had some qualifications for a place upon that committee i had been attorneygeneral of my state for fourteen years i had been engaged in litigation against railroads in florida involving the fundamental question of just and reasonable rates i had been associated for over ten years with special counsel of the florida railroad commission i will say without vanity or boastfor i do not think the house would credit me with thatthat every suit instituted by me against the railroads on behalf of the people of florida was won lin the courts mr chairman the minority leader has exercised the power which the speaker conferred upon him and removed me from that committee he could have had it just for the asking if he had told me that it involved any principle if he had told me that there was another man better qualified than i i would have resigned it i got it as a matter of grace from mr davis and through the courtesy of mr williams and he could have had it back for the asking but sir the gentleman accompanied that removal with what i consider a statement of reasons harsh unjust and untrue i hope yet that in our party caucus or in some formal manner the gentleman will recede from his position because i say to him frankly without the feeling against him that i had a few days agofor i had it then i confess and a very deep feelingthat perhaps he did me a service in checking my attempt to brng this matter to the attention of the house the other day for in my feeling i might have said on the floor of this house in my immediate indignation things that possibly i might not have liked to read in the record the next morning it may be that the gentleman did me a service withoutintending it"], [0.06239116191864014, 0.9376088380813599, 1, "i know you didin december 1902 now when the representatives of the sovereign people of the state of georgia answering the demands of the people of the districts answering the demands of our party made known through its convention and endorsed by these railroad lawyers and directors when we undertake

like a second declaration of independence was the platform adopted by the democratic party in 1896 upon it we placed our nominee a leader who though he was defeated then and again in 1900 stands before this country today before the world as the most prominent and preeminent citizen of america and we made this declaration in that platform we demand the enlargement of the powers of the interstate commerce commission and such restriction and guarantees for the control of railroads as will protect the people from robbery and oppression and again in 1900 we favor an enlargement of the scope of the interstatecommerce law as will enable the interstate commerce commission to protect individuals and communities from discriminations and the public from unjust and unfair transportation rates again in 1904 we demand the enlargement of the powers of the interstate comi merce commission to the end that the traveling public and shippers of this country may have prompt and adequate

and a great panic which began in 1890 with farmers in kansas burning their corn for fuel and farmers in mississippi selling their cotton below the actual cost of production until it had swept itself away from the farmer who first suffered to the banker and caused an acute bursting in high financial circles in 1893 the panic of 1873horrible in its aspects with molly mcguires and all thatwas under a republican tariff and the hard times and panic from 1890 to 1893 saw its incipiency and its end under a republican tariff by the way it was a very small panic in 1857 and a biggerpanicthe most serious we have ever hailin 1873 i have been trying for a long time to get to my analysis of the speech of my friend from iowa and i am a little afraid if i do not get to it sometime today people will think that i have taken to a tree myself so with the good will of the house i shall proceed after the gentleman from iowa had gone as far as he did into ancient history he finally admitted the truth about our position which is that we are simply antiprotectionists but not free traders that we are tariffforrevenue people that we do want to maintain the government of the united states that we know we have got to have money to maintain it that we know we must raise the major part of that money by a tariff we may regret the latter fact but we face it and surrender to it as we do to all facts we would not inaugurate protectionism where it does not now exist we would remove it wherever it does exist as rapidly as it can be safely done we would continue in this course until we could levy tariff taxes with an eye single to public needs regardless of private schemes we would not permit the taxing power to be used with the paramount or sole end of protection for the purpose of favoritism in a word our purpose is revenue if as an unavoidable and necessary incident to getting needed revenue there came somewhat of protection that of course we could not help i have already stated that even a 5 per cent duty carries at least 5 per cent of advantage for the home producer against the foreign producer who would export from his country to the united states that is unavoidable but our purpose will be to get revenue our method will be to tax consumers as nearly as possible equally in proportion to their ability to bear the needful burden now we do hold as the gentleman from iowa said we did that protectionism is robbery and i am coming to that in a minute and am going to show why it is robbery we do not hold that a tariff is robbery why a tariff levied for the purpose of supporting the government no matter whether there go with it as an unavoidable incident but not as an end a certain degree of protection or not is no more robbery than any other form of taxation for public purposes levied upon the citizen is we do hold that taking money out of my pocket or the pocket of anyone else not for the purpose of supporting the government not for public use or a public end but for the purpose of supporting some other producerfor private use and private endis a totally unjustifiable prostitution of governmental functions and that as such it is robberya legislative confiscation of my means pro tanto in order to benefit somebody else i hold moreover that we can not repeat nor emphasize that idea too often or too much what is robbery robbery is a taking in whole or in part of what belongs to one for the use of another so much for that then the gentleman said that there was a certain degree of dumping going on now dumping is a spasmodic act dumping is not a habit dumping is not a constant practice dumping is not a part of ordinary business and when i get to the proof which the gentleman asked for i will show that these processes we have been going through of selling cheaper abroad than at home have been too extensive as to articles and too long enduring as to time to be dismissed with a phrase dumping yesterday the gentleman from iowa was very careful not to come down to present existing industrial conditions not a single bill pending before this house did the gentleman mention in connection with not a single question of tariff abuse now attracting our attention concerning any schedule of the tariff did he concern himself in speaking he only made a general allaround whoopitupyourepublicansandstandtotheparty speech he said that the measure of protections for which lie stood was this the difference between cost of production here and the cost of production abroad and yet i have introduced a bill into this house to reduce duties except of course upon alcohol and tobacco where the duty must countervail the internalrevenue tax to reduce duties wherever they are above 100 per cent down to 100 per cent can it be possible that the difference between the cost of production at home and abroad is ever more than the entire cost of production yet i heard not the gentleman raise his voice to help me with that bill before the committee on ways and means i want his constituents in iowa to know that he has never been before the committee on ways and means to ask them to consider that or a similar bill or any other bill to correct or revise a single schedule of the dingley bill however much of an abuse i ask him now to get upon this floor before this session closes and tell his constituents in iowa whether he will or will not vote for such a bill will he stand by his own measure of protection or will he again fly to a tree upon yesterday i was interrupted to uch an extent that i did not reach the body of my argument indeed i was interrupted so rapidly and so furiously that something happened to me that never happened before in my life i began to tell an anecdoteand forgot to finish it i have no idea of finishingthe anecdote now it is too late for the effect i mention that to show the character of interruptions i shall ask gentlemen this morning in the interest of the house itself not to interrupt me unless with questions and those questions must be pertinent to the very point upon which i am at the time dwelling i do not say that in defense of myself but i fear i may wear out the patience of the house beyond all measure may become persona non grata to the house now i shall go on with the analysis of the speech of the gentleman from iowa the next thing i noted as i have partially said already was the gentlemans dumping theory he undertook to account for the fact that a great many of our manufacturers were selling goods cheaper abroad than at home upon the theory that they were dumping goods there and the gentleman seemed to think that we were complaining of the process of dumping he misunderstood the gravamen of our complaint our complaint is that they do not dump on us whenever they have anything good and cheap we think they might dump it upon the american consumer we think that if there were a natural course of business a normal state of affairs that they would just as soon sell goods cheap to you and me as sell them cheap to the frenchman and the englishman the gentleman quoted from mr ashley but ashleys dumping theory was a totally different thing it was where an association of manufacturers are purposely dumping goods at less than the cost or at less than a reasonable profit for the purpose of obtaining a start in a new market this american dumping which has been carried on by the united states steel association for example for over ten years has been in markets which they hold very much more nearly than the manufacturers of any other country ashley also refered to the dumping which is founded upon the idea of retaining an old market from the attacks of new competitors but neither of these cases is like the american dumping system if indeed the word dumping might apply to the latter at all our dumping if it may be called dumping is under agreement between american manufacturers not to sell in the america markets at less than a fixed price anything that can not be sold at this fixed price is by agreement shipped abroad not at a loss though at a less price than the domestic price it is not an emergency sale now and then but an habitual business then there comes the surplus theory gentlemen say we send only our surplus abroad now what is a surplus i understand how there could be a surplus at a cer tain price but if the price is lowered it decreases the surplus there is always a price at which there is no surplus at all and if there be a price at which there is no surplus at all and that be a profitable price we think that american tariffprotected manufacturers ought not to resort to this scheme of selling cheaper abroad than at home but ought to let us have equal advantage and if it be that they accept an unprofitable price now and then under the dire necessities of trade when they must dispose of a certain quantity of goods at a loss then i reply the american people ought to obtain the incidental benefit of the misfortune of the american manufacturer rather than the foreigner now the truth is that our selling abroad except in individual and exceptional instances is neither a surplus nor a dumping process it is a surplus process in this sense that at the price which the combinations fix for the sale of their goods in america there is a surplusa surplus over and above an effective demand at the exploitation price charged the american home consumer the moment that surplus arises at the exploitation price instead of reducing their price to the home consumer down to a reasonable profit they prefer to maintain the exploitation price unbroken at home and to ship abroad this exploitationprice surplusthis socalled surplusto be sold to the foreigner at the lower price and thus save their home market as they express it that is the situation in a nutshell and i now tell gentlemen upon the other side in connection with this welltoberemembered thing that they need not attempt to surround it to avoid it it is a fact it is irrefutable it is an indisputable fact and i am going to prove it before i get through today to every man who has not sufficient information already to know it it will do gentlemen no good to blink it it will do gentlemen no good to try to evade it gentlemen can not walk over it nor around it gentlemen have got to consider what the fact is what it means and what justifiable logical conclusion can be drawn from it and whether they wish the conditions to continue which make it a fact they must defend this system or they must destroy it one of the two i say they have either got to reduce the tariff 1906 1 to a point where when the american manufacturer is exploiting the american consumer at an unreasonable profit while he is selling abroad at a reasonable profit the foreign goods may come in and stop the process of exploitation or else they must go before the country and defend the system itself they can neither deny the fact nor can they get out of it as the gentleman from illinois attempted to do about the watch matter what was his plea there after first denying or seeming to deny that there was any system of this sort he finally said yes it is going on but it is only going on about what they call nickel watches or gilt watches it reminds me of the man who was arrested in texas and was about to be hung by a mob to a tree for stealing a horse at first he denied that he had stolen the horse and he made all sorts of proof much even of an irrelevent character he tried to prove an alibi and did prove a good character and did everything else but they kept crowding him and crowding him and crowding him and after a while he had to meet the issue squarely he said yes boys remember my mother remember my wife remember how much they depend on me i did steal the horse but it wasnt any big horse hardly a horse at all it was nothing but a little bit of a colt and the colt of a mexican pony at that why the gentleman from iowa in the course of his remarks quoted from mr schwab himself testimony against his own statement but i leave that to the record as it stands the gentleman gave you his measure of protection i have quoted it to you the president has given his measure of protection it is slightly different from the imeas ure of protection of the gentleman from iowa i was about to give it yesterday when i yielded the floor for adjournment the presidents measure of protection advocacy is the difference between the scale of wages here and the scale of wages abroad now i say that any fairminded man will admit that the difference between the scale of wages abroad and the scale of wages here can never amount to the total labor cost entering into the total cost of a given product now then the total labor cost entering into a product will not be on an average over 25 or 30 per cent of the total cost of its productionlabor material transportation to america and all there are some products so near the state of raw material that it may be slightly more but the more highly finished the product is the more is the work of transformation done by machinery and the less comparatively is the proportion of manlabor cost entering into the total cost of the finished product i say that in consequence of that fact few men will deny the statement that a reasonable revenue tariff will more than make up for any difference that exists between the scale of wages abroad and the scale of wages here especially if the lowest revenue duty is placed on tools and raw materials the necessaries of industry for example take cheviots manufactured here and manufactured in the english markets i have the amount of labor cost entering into the goods in each country and i have the amount of the total cost entering into the goods in each country and i think it will astonish some of you gentlemen to know that as regards this article which i am using only as an illustration the proportion that the labor cost bears to the total cost in great britain is 30 per cent plus and th proportion which the labor cost bears to the total cost in america is only 24 per cent plus in other words the proportion is less in great britain this is true also of steel products as i shall incidentally show later on why because our people have in the business better machinery and more efficient labor and laborers that tend more machinery and work longer hours than in great britaineight hours there universally against ten here generally labor which moreover turns out more product per hour while working i quote from the unpublished manuscript of a book entitled tariff reform being prepared by professor conner some time an instrudtor in economics in the university of iowa and later holding the same position in the university of pennsylvania he quotes from the report of the bureau of labor senate document no 20 fiftyfifth congress third session as an illustration the figures concerning cost and labor cost of cheviots here are the tables mens sack suits united states 1897 cheviot cost of labor in transforming materials 17 cost of all items except labor 3 58 total cost 475 in great britain the cost of making the cheapest grades of sack suits whether of worsted serge or tweed no cheviot given was each as follows cost of labor in transforming materials 1 56 cost of all other items 3 18 total 4 74 here note that the labor cost in great britain is both absolutely and relatively greater than in the united states there are articles of course where the labor cost in great britain forms a larger proportion of the total cost than it does here but i venture to say that in no case can any gentleman find a case where the diffeuence between the two labor costs will amount to over 15 or 20 per centmark me the difference between the two items of labor cost entering into the yard the pound or the bale of goods not the total cost of labor in either country nor the per diem wage so i am willing to take the presidents measure of protection if he will only stand by it because it will require only a revenue tariff and one under the maximum revenueyielding point at that but the gentleman from iowa says that the republican platform said that the tariff was to be revised without injury to any american industry i noticed that word any it is going pretty far what does it mean when you bring it down to the final and practical analysis it means that they will not revise it when anybody complains now what does that mean why it is the old fallacy as old as the world the claim of vested right in an existing wrong it is the old old appealas old as the worldthe appeal not to remedy an evil however palpable and great the evil may be lest the men who are being benefited at the time by the existence of the evil shall lose their benefit you can not stand upon that gentlemen then the gentleman from iowa went on to boast of our great foreign commerce our intercourse with foreign nations as he called it i have had already the honor once before at this session of demonstrating upon this floor that our intercourse with foreign nations our volume of foreign tradeimports added to exportsis less in proportion to our population and is less n proportion to our wealth than that of canada or that of the argentine republic so another of your republican positions founded on a false boast goes by the board then he went on to show our progress under the tariff for the last ten years upon yesterday in reply to a question from mr landis of indiana i took up the figures of increase in the last ten census years and compared them with the increase of the decade from 1850 to 1860 under the lowest tariff we have ever had and i demonstrated yesterday that in production of corn in railroad mileage in manufacturing increase even in both capital and product the percentage of increase from 1850 to 1860 had exceeded the percentage from 1890 to 1900 the gentleman then made one of the most wonderful arguments i ever heard of he said people talk about the good old times but he described how hard the times were as compared with our good times how did he prove his statement he proved it by an assertion which if true is the most astonishing demonstration of unparalleled prosperity in those hard old times that the world ever saw what was it it is his assertion it is not mine he says that in those early days in iowa men paid 40 per cent for money when they went out upon their homesteads and cleared the forests and yet that they built themselves homes and saved those homes ah what a state of prosperity that must have been when men could pay 40 per cent and still build for themselves homes in the wilderness and come out free of debt why a man could not do it today on 10 per cent high rates of interest are not indicia of hard times on the contrary whenever times are flush productive enterprises are growing men want to add to existing plants or found new plants and so anxious aire they that they borrow to do it consequently the number of borrowers increasesthat is the number of men who can or think they can make money by borrowing moneyand the number of lenders decreases both because they are already lending so much and because most men having money think they can get a better return by using it themselves on farm or in mill than by lending as the rate of interest depends upon the number of borrowers or wouldbe borrowers on the one side which constitutes the demand for loans and the number of lenders or canbe lenders on the other side which constitutes the supply in the loan market the rate of interest necessarily goes up the demand for loans is large the supply of loanable funds is small all flush times have been periods of comparative high rates of interest and all dull times have been periods of comparative low rates of interest in flush times men are seeking to put their energies and money into productive enterprise and are willing to borrow rather than not go in while in dull times they are seeking to put their money into bonds and stocks and fixed things where the principal is absolutely safe but the interest low because they are afraid of losing it if put in active productive enterprises there does not exist upon the american continent today a place where anybody could borrow money at 40 per cent as in the olden days 6c160 and come out wholegoing into a wilderness at that and clearing the forest and building homes i remember when i borrowed money at 18 per cent and paid off old debts as well as new and laid up money it was during clevelands first administrationnot that his being president had anything to do with it but i am fixing the date the gentleman says that in the silver campaign we cried out for high prices and that now we are crying out for low prices the gentleman ought to know the difference between that sort of a high price which is created by a toll a toll levied upon products in commerce on their way from the producer to the consumer and that sort of a high price which is created by an abundance of metallic pricefixing money enabling people to do their business easily the former sort of high price is created by restriction of the supply by shutting out goods which would compete for sale every restriction of supply makes for scarcity and makes against abundance and makes therefore for poverty and against wealth because abundance of what men need is wealth and a scarcity of things needed is poverty for the mass whatever it may mean for the few but when the price is high owing to the fact of an abundance of money as it was after the discovery of gold in california in the early days and as it is now to the greatest extent possible caused by the increased discoveries of gold and owing to cheapened processes of extracting gold ore then that price is not really an increase in the price of corn as compared with cotton or an increase in the price of cotton as compared with silk but it is a decrease simply in the price of money as compared with everything elseas measured in terms of other things and therefore an increase in the price of everything else as measured in terms of moneyand it therefore merely goes to show that money itself is not as high priced as it used to be this is simply because it is more abundant abundance is a blessing scarcity is a curse that is the sole difference in that connection i will say that in my opinion this present ascending scale of prices which has led to this present prosperity not only in the united states but in canada and the argentine and in mexico and in germany and all over the worlda degree of prosperity lasting longer than any the world has seen in a long time and greater than any except that which immediately followed the discovery of gold in californiahas been due to the gradually increasing annual crop of gold in this world this year the gold product will be over 250 000 000 in 1893 it was about 120 000 000 higher prices have been very largely due not to the condition of things amongst products themselves but to the fact that the price of money has gone down and the price of money has gone down because of the increase in the quantity of money just as the price of wheat would go down because of the increase in the quantity of wheat why the very thing that the democracy contended for in the silver campaign has been justified once more i congratulate the gentlemen upon this side of the chamber the acceptance of the quantitative theory of money never disputed except in the early and late nineties is once more universal the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber themselves constantly boast of the amount of gold circulating in the united states dragged from the mines of south africa from the klondike from colorado and even got out of silver ores that were formerly thrown upon the dump as useless for gold purposes but now yielding from 10 to 20 per cent of gold we of the united states have received more than our proportionate share owing to our exports mainly of cotton and grain neither of which benefits from the protective system ab we asked that legislation should increase the volume of metallic money by adding silver to it but god who is kinder to his children than his childrens legislatorsaye kinder to them than they are to themselves answered our prayer by increasing the volume of metallic money in the shape of gold true he answered it in a different way but it was answered we have received what we asked foran immensely increased volume of metallic money without waiting upon your legislators prosperity came just as we said prosperity would come if basic money could be increased in volume and now like the humbugs you are you are claiming that that prosperity that exists all over the world and which is due to the gradually ascending scale of prices that in its turn is due to an annually increasing volume of metallic pricefixing gold money is the result of the passage of the dingley tariff bill in the united states of america that ascending scale of prices encouraging productive enterprise and the present comparatively high prices will continue how long it will continue until one of three things happens either until the annual crop of gold ceases to be an increasing crop or until productive enterprise shall have caught up with and passed in its demand the supply coming from the increased crop of gold or until some great national catastrophe or overspeculation upsets all reckonings so the truth of the quantitative theory of money was never more undeniably demonstrated than now and that is all we fought for and was what some of you denied at that time we lost silver as a money is now and perhaps forever doomed but we got in a different shape what we fought for moreover paradoxical as it may seem the fact that we got it rendered our defeat on that particular question permanent the high price that comes from an abundance of metallic money is wealth itself as all abundance is but the high price that comes by subtracting from production a part of itself by levying a toll or tariff upon it on its way from the producer to the consumer tends to the restriction of supply tends to scarcityraises prices that way and in that way only it necessarily therefore tends toward the decrease of the total volume of wealth of the country in which the process takes place a decrease of wealth is a decrease of the fund out of which wages must be paid and hence tends to decrease wages let me read you something upon that subject i am going to get one of my friends to read it i am so tired"], [0.07750505208969116, 0.9224949479103088, 1, "just one word more and then i will now it so happens in this world that no patient can exist long in a healthful condition upon the same medicine no matter whether it be governmentally administered or not the time will come when the thing that was formerly a medicine will become a poison massachusetts now is crying out for a revision of the tariff changed conditions have brought it about that she feels the burdensomeness of her part of the payment of tariff taxes it is not nearly as nice as having the otherfellow pay the tax while she collected god bless her i am glad to see her back shoulder to shoulder with old virginia as she was early in the history of this country and once more recognizing democratic principles massachusetts did not go into the tariff willingly it was forced upon her by the west her great statesman daniel webster made a speech against it a speech which even he the godlike daniel himself could never subsequently answer and which nobody yet has answered at that time massachusetts was a navigating state and desired to remain one but when they put this iniquitous system upon the statute books massachusetts amidst her rockribbed hills with her magnificent intelligence her superb courage her excellent adaptiveness said all right that is the law of the country and we will proceed to take advantage of it and when it comes to molding schedules we will mold them to suit new england let the southerners with their sentiment and their oratory go let the westerners with their patriotism loudmouthed pass by we will pay attention to schedules and new england paid attention to schedules and for a long time had her way about them no matter what party was in power now some of them havecome to be awfully inconvenient and she wants to get rid of such of them as are inconvenient pennsylvania and the west got to fixing things very well may god bless you to our ranks we will help you to get rid of them we have been robbed too but when you come into a court of equity you must do equity there is one power in the world that can rid you of the inequity of your part of the burden sharing even in present conditions and that power is the democratic party but massachusetts has helped to take some of the tax off the kansans mower and reaperthey are his raw material his toolsoff the blacksmiths hammer the carpenters saw and nails the steel rails necessary for the development of our internal commerce and the mississippians cotton gin bagging and ties massachusetts says she wants free hides i have offered a bill reducing the duty on hides to 5 per cent a reduction of twothirds the duty on sole leather to 7 per cent ad valorem and to reduce the balance of the leather and harness and shoes schedule and leatherglove schedule 50 per cent surely you are willing if the duties on your raw material be reduced 66j per cent to reduce the duty upon the finished product 50 per cent i have with the view again of trying your republican friends introduced another bill to put hides on the free list provided you will reduce tha balance of the schedule a little more than 50 per cent when you come into a court of equity do equity if you are to get a reduction on your raw material in the name of justice let the millions who must wear shoes and whose wives and children must wear them get them for a less part of a days wage there is no more honest no more intelligent part of this union than the young democracy of the state of massachusetts and it is going to win its fight because the republican party has not the couragei said brains a moment ago i believe i will take that backit has not the courage to disturb this protective chainarmor suit why not because your several pocket receipts from the system are all banded together like one of those oldtime sets of armor that the knights wore plate by plate riveted together and the minute one chain broke the whole armor fell to pieces that is what you are afraid of and yet a certain sir robert peel in england who was a protectionist and found himself in such a situation had sense enough and courage enough to go at it and go at it gradually not to dynamite the whole thing but gradually to bring about a successful issue out of a false position you say that you are afraid that we democrats if we try it will dynamite and blow up the house in order to build up another house well if so then for gods sake if you think as you speak revise this tariff yourselves remove its excrescences remove its injustices fix itso that no american manufacturer under its egis and shelter can longer sell goods cheaper to the foreigner at a good profit while he exploits the american consumer at an unreasonable profit do that do it yourselves i say i am so much an american rather than a democrat i would rather see it done by you than that it should not be done at all and if it be true that we can not do it without dynamiting all the industries of the countrythat proposition i denybut if i believed it then i would rather see you do it than to see us do it you say you are the party which does things do something you are afraid you are afraid of finding yourselves in the attitude of freebooters at daggers points about an equitable division of the spoils we used to say about the republican party that it might be guilty of every sin in the world but that it did not lack courage and it did not lack brains that was when you called yourselves the party of moral ideas now you have only schedule ideas now you have got down to the point where you lack courage and i begin to mightily suspect that you iack brains it is one of gods ordinances that people who know they are wrong

instead of simply stating it as you do now in the iouse you will notice that on these questions of such importance i do not simply get upand i say it respectfully to my friendi do not simply get up and say so and so and leave it with my own unsupported statement but i go and get the records and read the proof to the house there are none so deaf as those who will not listen when you are giving them what paddy gave the drum to wit the teuth there is none so blind as an iowa standpatter they will not see the truth even if neighbor governor cunmins states and restates it let me go a little further here again is what mr clay said if there is any truth in political economy it can not be that result will agree with the prediction for we are instructed by our experience that the eonsumption of any article is in proportion to the reduction of its price find that in general it may be taken as a rule that the duty upon an article forms a part of its price now i see my friend from iowa is not listening again here i find clay totally disagreeing with my distinguished friend from iowa i will read that clause again and that in general it may be taken as a rule that the duty upon an article forms a part of its price senator sherman and mr reed our late speaker said the same thing now in the nine years i have been hearing my distinguished friend from iowa hold this house spellbound in defending trustmaking tariffs he never made any such statement as that and you might wait nine hundred and ninetynine years and the gentleman neve r would agree that the tariff tax became a part of the price of an article so gentlemen i have read a lot of utterances here from henry clay who in his early days in the jungles of dear old kentucky was glad to wear any kind of clothes that he could get a condition that i dare say my distinguished iowa friend never found himself in at any time i dare say he always had whatever he wanted i hope he always will but sooner or later henry clay saw and this is the point i make that manufacturers were not always infants always needing maminmies to put pap in their lips he saw that manufacturers from 1810 to 1833 about twentythree years had risen to a point where they only needed nine years more protection for the infants to stand alone and yet here is my dear iowa friend who sooner or later will be gathered to his fathers vanting in 1906 to stand by these giants to help up the same giants that stood by henry clay in their majestic strength sixty years ago now my friend who is familiar with these facts had forgotten them yesterday and i wanted then to correct him but i would not interrupt my friend from mississippi who was making his usual magnificent defense of a revenue tariff keeping up a good democratic contribution to the record to go alongside of the bad reading from our standpoint of the gentlemans good speech from his standpoint and so i have deferred it until today to reply to tile gentleman from iowa so now we have henry clay coming to where he is almost as good a tariff democrat as andrew jackson i insist neither was a standpatter just a word in passing on jackson getting the government out of debt in 1832 he said to congress i can not too cordially congratulate congress and my fellowcitizens on the near approach of that memorable and happy eventthe extinction of the public debt of this great anud free nation faithful to the wise and patriotic policy marked out by the legislation of the country for this object the present administration has devoted to it all the means which a flourishing commerce has supplied and a prudent economy preserved for the public treasury now let us see what president andrew jackson said in his farewell address to his country after he had gone through the great struggle with nick biddle and his corrupting monopoly and crushed both what else did he do he approved a great number of tariffreform laws he reduced the tariff what else he crushed every thing else that undertook to run congress defy the law and outrage the people of this country jackson was a great private citizen an illustrious soldier a great clean and upright and fearless president so much so that even the gentleman from iowa alludes to him with pride and pleasure as we all do his experience with tariff makers and monopolists for eight years had reimpressed him with the evils that flow from such sources and when he came to lay down his high trust he wrote a farewell address among other things commending the farewell address of george wash ington which i may say here you did not think enough of tile other daywashingtons birthdayto have read i was up in connecticut making a speech to the sons of the american revolution that day and they asked me having seen in the papers the action of the house what in the world the house meant by not reading washingtons farewell address i told them i wasnt allowed to know now this illustrious president andrew jackson in his farewell address speaks of the duties q the citizen and lawmaker thus 5 in the legislation of congress also and in every measure of the general government justice to every portion of the united states should be faithfully observed no free government can stand without virtue in the people and a lofty spirit of patriotism and if the uordid feelings of mere scllislhues sbailusurp the place which ought to be filled by public spirit the legislation of congress will soon be converted into a scramble for personal and sectional advantages under our free institutions the citizens of every quarter of our country are capable of attaining a high degree of prosperity and happiness without seeking to profit themselves at the expense of others and every such attempt must in the end fail to succeed for the people in every part of the united states are too enlightened not to understand their own rights and interests and to detect and defeat every effort td gain undue advantages over them and when such designs are discovered it naturally provokes resentments which can not always be easily allayed justicefull and ample justiceto every portion of the united states should be the ruling principle of every freeman and should guide the deliberations of every public body whether it be state or national these are wise and lofty sentiments that we shouldlive up to today again he spoke of unjust tariffs in part thus there is perhaps no one of the powers conferred on the federal government so liable to abuse as the taxing power the most productive and convenient sources of revenue were necessarily given to it that it might be able to perform the important duties imposed upon it and the taxes which it laysoupon commerce being concealed from the real payer in the price of the article they do not so readily attract the attention of the people as smaller sums demanded from them directly by the taxgathererhe says the tariff tax is concealed from tile real payer how in the price of the article but the gentleman from iowa will deny that yet clay also admitted in effect this as a fact but the tax imposed on goods enhances by so much the price of the commodity to the consumertime gentleman will dispute thatand as many of thele duties are imposed on articles of necessity which are daily used by the great body of the people the money raised by these imposts is drawn from thelr pockets congress has no right under the constitution to take money from the people unless it is required to execute some one of the specific powers intrusted to the government and if they raise more than is necessary for such purposes it is an abuse of the power of taxation and unjust and oppressive it may indeed happen that the revenue will sometimes exceed the amount anticipated when the taxes were laid when however this is ascertained it is easy to reduce them and in such a case it is unquestionably the duty of the government to reduce them for no circumstances can justify it in assuming a power not given to it by the constitution nor in taking away the money of the people when it is not needed for the legitimate wants of the government the gentleman from iowa says touch not handle not reduce not a single tariff rate stand pat these rates are sacred neither jackson nor clay ever uttered a standpat sentiment continuing andrew jackson further said the result of this decision has been felt in the rapid extinguishment of the public debt and the large accumulation of a surplus in the treasury notwithstanding the tariff was reduced and is now very far below the amount originally contemplated by its advocates but rely upon it the design to collect an extravagant revenue and to burden you with taxes beyond the economical wants of the government is not yet abandoned the various interests which have combined together to impose a heavy tariff and to produce an overflowing treasury are too strong and have too much at stake to surrender the contest the corporations and wealthy individuals who are engaged in large manufacturing establishments desire a high tariff to increase their gains designing politicians will support it to conciliate their favor and to obtain the means of profuse expenditure for the purpose of purchasing influence in other quarters and since the people have decided that the federal government can not be permitted to employ its income in internal improvements efforts will be made to seduce and mislead the citizens of the several states by holding out to them the deceitful prostect of benefits to be derived from a surplus revenue collected by the eneral government and annually divided among the states and if encouraged by these fallacious hopes the states should disregard the principles of economy which ought to characterize every republican government and should indulge in lavish expenditures exceeding their resources they will before long find themselves oppressed with debts they are unable to pay and the temptation will become irresistible to support a high tariff in order to obtain a surplus for distribution jackson warned his countrymen against corporations and wealthy individuals engaged in large manufacturing establishments and high tariffs and designing politicians was he a false prophet i continue to read jacksons address do not allow yourself my fellowcitizens to be misled on this subject the federal government can not collect a surplus for such purposes without violating the principles of the constitution and assuming powers which have not been granted it is moreover a system of injustice and if persisted in will inevitably lead to corruption and must end in ruin the surplus revenue will be drawn from the pockets of the peoplefrom the farmer the mechanic and the laboring classes of society but who will receive it when distributed among the states where it is to be disposed of by leading state politicians who have friends to favor and political partisans to gratifyy it will certainly not be returned to those who paid it and who have most need of it and are honestly entitled to ithe speaks of the safe rule there is but one safe rule and that is to confine the general

nothing to do with the report by the majority of the democrats upon that committee on the bill which they did report and the neoessary consequent turning down not only of the hearst bill but of thirteen or fourteen others that were pending before the committee and nobody knows that better than the gentleman from florida i pride myself and i believe i have a right to pride myself upon one thing and all the more because i have so few things upon which to pride myself and that one thing is that i never permit my personal likes or dislikes to interfere with me in the transaction of public business i believe it is notorious that that is true i have treated the gentleman from new york like any other member of this house two years ago i put him upon the only committee that he asked to be put upon i put him there after the committees had been filled up and the names of the men appointed had been published i went to a gentleman on the ommittee and told him i wanted the place for him and he gave it up so that the gentleman from new york might have it this year he has been advanced to the senior democratic place upon that committee and will in due course of seniority be chairman if the country goes democratic and he remains in the house then the gentleman from new york thrbugh his california papers having shown great interest in the subject of irrigation was put by me this congress upon the committee on irrigation of arid lands as a former california man interested in that subject it is true perhaps i ought not to say iti do not love the gentleman from new york why should i love a millionaire with a whole lot of papers that seem to be used solely for the purpose so far as i am concerned of breaking me down i do not make the mistake of the gentleman from florida i do not regard myself as a national issue therefore while i do not like the attitude of the gentleman from new york toward me that does not control me in attending to my business upon this floor or my treatment of him as a legislator i do not know whether i ought to say anything more or not i did what i did because it was right it was right it is right it was wise and it is wise i am justified by the almost unanimous opinion of this side of the house the gentleman asked me to call a caucus for the purpose of having myself rebuked why the gentleman knowsno member of this house knows better than hethat there is a prescribed method of calling a caucus i am not vain or anything of that sort but at the same time i have too much selflove to want to call a caucus to rebuke myself if the gentleman thinks the members of the party are willing to do it he can call a caucus for that purpose if he can get a sufficient number of signatures and if he can not get enough to call a caucus i suppose he would admit in advance that he could not get enough to justify his position of rebuking me for my action now i have done what i did in malice to none and in charity to all i promoted the gentleman who has just taken his seatthe gentleman from floridato foreign affairs which is the fourth most important committee of this house the committee on rules is first ways and means second appropriations third and foreign affairs fourth because it deals with all international questions and with the affairs of the state department whose cabinet head is the american premier now if the gentleman had gone along quietly it would have helped him in florida it would not have hurt him and if i may be excused for telling an anecdote on a grave and dignified occasion i believe i will tell one a man died in new york his body was carried to the morgue a description of the body was published in the papers finally two brothers out in texas whose father had gone to new york at some time concluded it was their father the corpse bore their fathers name they were ranchmen and wealthy so they wired on and said the body seems to be the body of so and so if so to have the undertaker dress the corpse in a proper manner and embalm it and they would be up there they went on up and looked at the corpse and it looked very much like what their father had been now there was on it one of those undertakers cloths to keep the lower jaw from dropping down the cloth in some way became dislocated and the jaw dropped down and there fell out of the mouth of the corpse a set of false teeth then these boys who had come to new york said that is not our father he never had false teeth he did not have time to get false teeth and we decline to pay the funeral expenses nothing thus far having been done then the undertaker had a conversation with the corpse after the boys had left said he oh yes if you had kept your blamed mouth shut you would have had a firstclass funeral conducted in a firstclass manner with all sorts of plumes and feathers and four black horses and a great big metallic casket and a fine hearse and hired mourners with all the latest embellishments so welcome to the feelings of corpses but you could not keep it shut and now you will be buried without any honors and nobody will attend the funeral there will not even be any hired mourners it is seldom indeed that intense national interest can be aroused in the exhibition of any mans sores unless the sores are of a contagious character happily for mankind the sores of injured vanity are never contagious i have not invited this i have tried my best to prevent it i have tried to save the gentleman from himself would to god that i could have done it he belongs to a grand old southern family who have contributed to the statesmanship and the prowess of this country not a little by their history in georgia in mississippi and in florida i did all i could the letter which the gentleman publishes there from myself to him shows how careful i was to try to spare his feelings even after the first interview in the star had appeared attacking me in a vicious manner to say the least i can not answer these personal attacks i do not know how to answer them i only remember this not to imitate them and i am not going to imitate them i am not going to imitate them because of my recollection of an incident in my own life my mothers father while a selfmade man and an uneducated one in a certain sense but a broadly read one was a man of magnificent sense of propriety as well as magnificent common sense soon after the time of the breaking out of the war when i was a boy some planters sons were over at our house on the long pavilion on the west side and got to discussing the question of secession which was then rife some ladies were present one of the gentlemen the son of a neighboring planter became excited during the discussion and said things which he ought not to have said nothing that could not have been said in the presence of ladies but something that was rude my old grandfather had a way of never mentioning any mans name angrily and when he did not like anybody he would simply move out of the crowd when this man had left without mentioning his name at all my grandfather put his hand on my head and said john my boy remember all your life never to insult anyone except when the insult can be immediately resented i remembered that and i have always tried to act in accordance with it i am sorry not even angry though it may appear strange to the gentleman from florida that i could not pyevent him from selfinflicted hurt that i could not save him from himself he has had his way finally through the yielding of the floor manager of the republican party who of course wanted to see this linen washed the gentleman has had his way he has not helped me he has not helped himself he has not helped the democratic party he has not helped the country he has done but one thing that i can see and that was to give me the opportunity to explain how it was that i had nothing under the sun to do with the fact that the hearst bill was not the bill reported by that committee i did not attend the meeting of the committee in order to mold legislation i attended to harmonize differences and i finally thought that i had harmonized them the gentleman says if i do not withdraw a charge of some sort that personal relations will cease we had better be frank now i have made but one charge that especial language in the newspaper i did not literally use i have made but one charge i used this language and i repeat it now that i had to have harmony and united action upon that committee in order to keep that committee from appearing ridiculously divided where the party was nearly united to a man i removed the two rather than the four for these reasons and i repeat it for the further reason that the two had defied the action of a democratic caucus and that the two had totally failed to agree with their four democratic colleagues and that later on in the summer the gentleman from florida had taken pains to be interviewed in order to tell the country that he would still not agree with the four i could not expect the four to agree with the two i cared not and i stated it again and again and again last congress and i state now to the members of that committee the house and the country that i did not care what bill they brought out provided only that these four things were in the bill and they were in the davey bill first give to the commission the power to prescribe a substitute rate second put that rate into operation immediately or after reasonable notice third allow it to go in the regular course by appeal or review to the courts and not to be set aside except when set aside in that way by a final decision the courts acting as an appellate court and not hearing the facts de novo fourth not to be suspended in the course of litigation except where the constitution gives judicial power to suspend namely where the decision is in the opinion of the court unconstitutional as taking private property without due process of lawthat is confiscatory in its character or where in the opinion of the court the decision of the commission is unlawful that is that it transcended the power conferred upon the commission by the congress of the united states now i said then i say now if you put those four things in the bill that is all i want i said if you put those four things in the bill that will be satisfactory to me i do not care whose bill it is i had a bill pending before the committee and i might as well get angry because they did not report the bill and call it the williams bill but they did not"], [0.09959286451339722, 0.9004071354866028, 1, "during this

desire to address the members during the time allotted to me upon a muchdiscussed longprotracted and debated questionthe railroad rate question one would think that the members here and the public had heard that subject almost ad nauseam to say nothing of ad infinitum but when the hepburn bill finally passes even with the remedial amendments impressed upon i t by the senate it will still leave the shippers of florida and the consumers and producers of that state largely defenseless against railway extortion and railway exactions and for that defenseless position the american congress is responsible democrats and republicans alike this question has been treated in the debates upon it as nonpartisan and i am glad of it it enables me to speak with freedom as to my own partys action upon railway rate legislation without having the hypocritical pretense made that it disturbs party harmony or in any way breaks in on the line of party allegiance what the people of florida want what the people of the third congressional district in that state want is for the american congress to write into the laws of this land provisions that will entirely guard them against unreasonable and unjust railway rate charges and against every device known to railway cunning and railway ingenuity to accomplish that result unless the congress yields that much then the people of florida have not obtained on the statute books of the united states that which they in part at least demand it is with the voice and sentiment of my people so far as i represent them upon this important occasion that i propose to submit some reflections upon a yet unsettled problem and i desire to say to my party colleagues in all candor and in all sincerity coming from a loyal democratic constituency that our people would have more pleasure in the criticisms coming from my party side of a republican president upon the railway rate question if their official action on the floor of this house had one year ago measured up to the length of his recommendations to the fiftyeighth congress i say frankly tht i speak in protest here against any shortcomings on the part of the democracy of the house of representatives as well as upon the part of the republicans upon this great national nonpartisan question it appears out of a longcontinued debate that there are two questions of primary importance in the consideration of this great question the controversy will never be ended the subject of this debate will never be concluded until these two questions are settled properly as long as the american congress leaves in the hands of the railroads the fundamental right of rate making as long as the people of this country through their legislative body leave in the hands of the railroads the power to fix their own valuations of their own property upon which just and reasonable rates are sought to be leviedas long as these two great powers are left in the hands of the railroads then i pronounce the hepburn bill with all the remedial amendments impressed upon it by the senate as a mere delusion and a snare it is not creditable to the american congress that they failed to write into the laws of the land those wise and just provisions which their own expert governmental agencies advised them to do and i say the american congress for ten years has been wisely and properly advised by their own interstate commerce commission and by the industrial commission which was composed of members of the house of representatives and of the senate and of ten prominent business men of the country the members of this house and of the senate have been properly advised by those voluminous and longextended reports for years past of the great evils done to the shippers of this country and to the producers and the consumers by railway extortion and the american congress has flouted those reportsand i use the word advisedly whose opinion is to control in framing legislation upon this subject not mine particularly not yours particularly not the opinions of democrats particularly not the opinions of republicans particularly if this congress does properly it will go to those reports and find out from them exactly wherein the shippers and producers and consumers in this country are injured by railway extortion now i propose to take up first the great subject of classification when the hepburn bill becomes a law without granting to the interstate commerce commission full power and control over the great classification of freight a great wrong and a great injury will have been done to the american producers the american shippers and the american consumers in not giving this power in the hepburn bill to the interstate commerce commission the members of congress have thrown aside the report of the industrial commission made to the fiftyseventh congress and have flouted and turned down the reports made to the senate and the house of representatives by their own governmental expert agents the interstate commerce commission i will discuss first the classification of freight rates the classification of freight rates is the true ratemaking power itself in another form the house of representatives is about to pass a bill which leaves this potent weapon of harm still unsheathed in the hands of the railroad companies if the american public fully understood these wise recommendations of the interstate commerce commission and the report of the industrial commission upon this subject of classification and if they believed them there are not many men on the floor of this house who could secure their election to the sixtieth congress unless they would put themselves in accord with them i wish first to read a letter that i addressed to the railroad commission in

that all matter written or printed which in any wise pertains to dealing iii futures shall be excluded from the mail there is nothing in my judgment that concerns the farmer so much just now as this very question i believe it is of more importance to him than any other bill that is pending before congress at this hour i say that with a full knowledge of the fact that there are many important measures pending here that would be helpful to the farmers if enacted into law but sirs i believe this is above all with them because it deals with a practice that controls the price of their products absolutely tley have nothing to say about it at all it makes the price fictitious all the time they do not know gentlemen where they are at at any stage of the proceeding sirs as i have indicated a bale of cotton well rounded weighing 500 pounds worth 50 today ought to be worth 50 tomorrow and wyould be worth 50 tomorrow but for this speculation in price wlich gentlemen will run it down perhaps to where it is only worth 40 tonorrow whcen the little fellows take hold of the bait and begin to nibble the prices begin to fluctuate at once and it is only a question of a short time when they will be safely landed in the speculators basket where they can flounder to the crack of doom without hope of relief that kind of dealing makes a fictitious price gentlemen and is unjust in every conceivable sense and should not be tolerated by the representatives of the american people when they know that the foundation of every institution rests upon the farmer as its corner stone the reason this kind of legislation is ignored by congress is because the farmer goes along in his everyday way following the mule from daylight until dark too busily engaged making an honest living to agitate questions too busy to think whether he will wire his representative about this or that species of legislation too tired at night to write him a letter requestifng him to interest himself in this or that kind of legislation and hence he is neglected by his congressman but the stockbrokers in the city of new york in chicago and in all of the other speculitive centers are never tired they are never too busy to look out for their interests they sirs have their eyes open for such legislation as this all the time and they can and will use the wire or the mail or any other instrumentality that can be brought to bear in order to prevent legislation of this sort but if the farmers will organize themselves as they should they can have their day of legislation if they resolve that by the eternal a measure of this kind shall be passed that they shall have relief sirs they can get it all they will have to do will be to say to a candidate for congress i will not vote for you for the nomination unless you pledge yourself to vote for a bill to prohibit dealing in futures if he refuses to pledge himself then they can nominate a candidate who will pledge himself to do it and they can find some one in every community who n ill sirs standing here as a democrat loving the principles of democracy as i do i want to say to you that if the farmers will consult their own interests they will not again vote for anyone for nomination or election to congress who will not pledge himself to vote to kill the future business if that is party treason make the most of it the farmers must open their eyes to the facts as they are they have got to wake up and if they will do it they will accomplish something along legislative lines but as i have said they have been too busy they have not had the time but the time is coming when they will have it and when they do wake up when they do start they will make just as good haids in the matter of controlling legislation as they made soldiers in the mighty ponflict between the states of this union and mio braver or better soldiers than they ever put foot upon a battlefield or rode a charger to his death therefore gentlemen i warn you now to give the matter some thought investigate see for yourselves if you do not think that the farmers are being iposed upon by the speculators of this country see if you think it is right that they shall make the farmers cotton worth 40 one day and 50 the next and vice versa see whether you think the farmer or the speculator ought to control the price of the farmers cotton their corn their meat and wheat

has come for completing the union of the states and doing away with territorial government within the borders of the united states aside from our outlying possessions we now have fortyfive sovereign states and these four territories upon which it is now proposed to confer statehood i desire to see the union of states completed by creating what i believe will be two great states in the westthe state of oklahoma and the state of arizonaas proposed by this bill we shall then have fortyseven states in the completed union all sovereign but under one flag the flag of a great and mighty nation it is said that we should not join new mexico and arizona in one state that some of the people of arizona are opposed to such action and that nothing should be done in opposition to their wishes well there are people in indian territory and people in oklahoma territory who are opposed to joining those two territories in one state why should not some one rise up and protest against this contemplated outrage but not a voice is raised against joining oklahoma and indian territory whether the people or some of the people of those territories want such actiomn taken or not yet either oklahoma or indian territory is much better fitted for and much better entitled to separate statehood than either new mexico or arizona oklahoma and indian territory have each a population an intelligent hustling vigorous american population of more than threequarters of a million people or jointly of more than a million and a half people with some apparent show of justice they might each claim the right if there were any such right to separate statehood with new mexico and arizona it is very different including indians mexicans and all new mexico has only about 200 000 people and arizona possibly a hundred and fifty thousand neither of them has as many inhabitants as the congressional district which i have the honor to represent yet our democratic friends would give each of them two united states senators and a representative in congress besides i for one protest against giving them any such advantage over the people 1 represent both political parties have declared in favor of admitting these territories to the union as states both parties have made it a political question it is idle to say it is not a political question the only difference between the parties is as to how they should be admitted the democratic party has declared in its national platform in favor of their admission as states but as separate states at least so far as arizona and new mexico are concerned the repubilcanparty by its action in congress in caucus and conference has declared in favor of the admission of all these territories as provided in this bill if i did not believe the republican position was the right position the only reasonable and justifiable position which i do i should yet hesitate long before i would take the responsibility of setting up my individual judgment against that of my party and deliberately bolt my own party caucus and render aid and comfort to the common enemy by voting with the democratic partythe solid democratic partyin this house why the fact that the democratic national convention declared for separate statehood for new mexico and arizona is proof conclusive that separate statehood ought not to be granted them for the democratic party can always be trusted to do the wrong thing and take the wrong side of all great questions i represent upon this floor a great republican district one of the greatest in the united statesa district that gave president roosevelt a majority in the last election of more than 25 000 votes those same voters when they sent me here did not expect me to be a free lance did not expect me to bolt the action of a republican caucus did not expect me to set up my individual judgment against the decrees of my party did not expect me to refuse to aid in carrying out the policies of our great republican leader theodore roosevelt but they did expect me and they had the right to expect me to support the republican president and to stand for whatever the majority of the republicans decreed to be for the best interest of the party and of the nation for one is synonymous with the other it has been said here and it is true that this government of ours is a government by party by organization and concerted action alone can any party hope to accomplish results we are all sent here by the votes of our party to carry out the principles and decrees of the party whose representatives we are no man is better than his party and when he gets the idea that he is then it is time for his party to retire him our whole government is based on the idea of majority rule expressed through political parties when the members of the party meet in caucus or primary or convention or conference and its members or delegates or representatives decide by majority vote then that is the law of the party and every man claiming membership in that party is bound thereby that is one thing i admire about the democratic party always whether in the majority or the minority they stand and do battle as a compact mass a welldrilled army time and again in perfect unison we have heard from the other side of this chamber during this debate the assertion that this is not a political or a partisan question wait until the final vote is taken and like a welldrilled and seasoned army with one accord every man of them will vote against this bill they invite republicans to vote for a plank of their political platform and i regret to say some in a spirit of what they think is independence will do so i do not believe in that kind of republicanism i think my party is right on this question if i did not think so i should fear that possibly i was wrong and that after all it was just possible that the combined wisdom of the republican party was more apt to be right than my own iudlvidual judgment the republican majority declared for this bill in the fiftyeighth congress they have again declared for it in this congress our great president nearer to the hearts of the people of this country than any other man who ever lived has in his message to this congress declared for this bill in the following words i recommend that indian territory and oklahoma be admitted as ocie state and that new mexico and arizona be admitted as one state there is no obligation upon us to treat territorial subdivi sions which are matters of convenience only as binding us on the question of admission to statehood nothing has taken up more time in the congress during the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four territories above mentioned and after careful consideration of all that has been developed in the discussions of the question i recommend that they be immediately admitted as two states there is no justification for further delay and the advisability of making the four territories into two states has been clearly established i am the keeper of no other mans conscience but i for one am willing to follow the president and cast my vote in accordance with his recommendation i for one am willing to follow in the path marked out by the leaders of the republican party and sanctioned in caucus by an overwhelming majority of my party as represented in this house i for one decline to follow the leader of the democratic minority in this house much as i admire him as a man and much as i respect him for his political astuteness i for one decline to shape my political course by the declarations of democratic platforms in casting my vote upon this bill i decline to be guided only by what is claimed to be the wishes of the people or a part of the people of arizona territory there are more than 80 000 000 people in this country who are interested in this question as well as the 150 000 people of arizona it is said that the people of arizona and new mexico are so different that they can not get along together i doubt that statement if it were true i should doubt their getting along well with the other states in this union again it should be remembered that even after the passage of this bill unless a majority of the people vote to adopt a constitution and thus accept the privilege of statehood which this bill offers there will be no statehood nothing will be forced upon them unless the peoplea majority of themaccept the benefits offered them by this bill i have no fears but that they will accept the terms we offer them are too liberal to be refused we give them sovereign statehood we admit them350 000 people onlyto full statehood to an equality in the senate of the united states with the 8 000 000 people of the state of new york with the 5 000 000 people of my own state of illinois they will accept the offer and i hope and believe that the new state of arizona will become a great and prosperous state of this union oklahoma will at once assume that position no one doubts that it is a great territory with a great people and it will be at once a great state i hope no republican in his spirit of independence or with his better than his party notions will vote to longer keep them out of the union and under a territorial form of government and arizona the land of eternal sunshine whose pure air brings health to all whose mountains yield untold wealth whose natural beauty and scenic effects will for all time command the admiration of all who visit its domain arizona with its grand canyon not one of the seven wonders of the world but the wonder of the world so grand so awe inspiring so terrible in its wondrous extent and magnificent beauty that tongue of man never has and never can describe it this great domain by this bill is granted sovereign statehood in this glorious union of states an honor never again to be granted to any territory orany land the last link in the indissoluble chain completing the great united states of america fifty years ago new mexico of which the present territory of arizona was then a part was clamoring for statehood it should never have been divided its soil and climate and resources are identical the natural union of the two will by this bill be again effected but instead of arizona being a part of the territory of new mexico the territory of new mexico will become a part of the state of arizona magnificent as will be the domain of the new state it will still be smaller by more than 25 000 square miles than the state of texas

interest of the people of those territories and of the people of the rest of the union time has often demonstrated the wisdom of the republican party on many great questions it will demonstrate again its wisdom in this the greatness of the republican party rests upon the fact that it has always been the party that did things the party that has never been afraid to meet conditions as they arise to assume every necessary responsibility in spite of doubts and warnings and the fears of the weak and timid the day this bill receives the signature of the president and becomes a law will mark a new

its issue of january 31 1902 in commenting upon this statement by the board of directors said the united states steel corporation has so far done exactly what its managers have here said they were trying and will continue to try to do they have rigidly kept their prices down to the point of reasonableness the louisville courierjournal a leading democratic paper said the policy of the corporation so far has been to try to make money by reducing the cost of production not by advancing the price to the consumer and all this time mark you the company was paying and still continues to pay the highest wages in the world the commercial and financial chronicle of new york the highest financial authority in this country reviewing our large production of pig iron in 1901 said one feature in connection with the years large production and consumption of iron should not escape attention for it is in one sense really the most striking characteristic of that period we refer to the fact that with the demand larger and more urgent than ever before in the countrys history prices were kept within moderate limits in the case of every one of the leading articles of iron and steel the average of prices for 1901 is lower than the average for 1900 and in most cases it is very much lower for this result preventing that extreme upward movement in values which on so many previous occasions has proven disastrous to the iron and steel industries the policy of the united states steel corporation is largely responsible in the early part of the previous year as will perhaps be remembered prices had risen to very high figures but then a decline set in which continued almost to the close of 1900 the beginning of 1901 therefore found prices at a fairly low level the business career of the united states steel corporation may be said to date from the 1st of april before the organization of this company the destructive competition threatened by the rivalry of the diffrent separate companies which are now embraced in its control acted somewhat to demoralize the iron and steel trades so that some intending buyers were induced to withhold their orders with the possibility of disturbance from that source removed the demand already large became more active than befre and if the steel corporation had not firmly resisted the rising tendency prices would undoubtedly have quickly recovered to the extraordinarily high figures ruling at the beginning of but the managers of that concern made it a cardnal point in their policy to keep prices at a level only high enough to leave a fair margin of profit andtheir action of course dominated the trade the result is that prices at the close of 1901 while ruling above the low figures prevailing at the close of 1900 did not on the whole show any great advances the price of steel rails was raised from 26 a ton to 28 in may but early in 1900 the price had been 35 and the average of rails for the whole year 1901 was only 27 83 against 32 29 the average for 1900 bessemer pig iron at pittsburg averaged 10 37 in december 1901 against 13 75 in december 1900 but in february 1900 the price had been 25 a ton steel billets at pittsburg were 84 50 in january 1900 19 75 in december 1900 and 27 50 in december 1901 the commercial and financial chronicle of new york is not a partisan journal nor is its trade columns edited for political purposes now i submit that i have shown that no evidence has been adduced that the custom of selling abroad for less than at lome has added anything to the cost to the american consumer i have further shown affirmatively that it does not and that under existing law prices are reasonable i submit that i have further shown that our selling abroad at reduced prices is limited in extent and is in accordance with the universal custom of the worlds export trade is to the advantage of the home consumer and especially to the advantage of the american workman and that even if subject to criticism it can not be remedied by tinkering with the tariff now i fain would stop here but a remark made by the gentleman from mississippi the other day urges me to proceed i say that in any event there is no danger that the people of this country will intrust to the democratic party the power to revise the tariff for two reasons first because the party has no convictions on the subject and second because it has only recently shown its utter inability wisely to deal with it the gentleman from mississippi said the other day pointing his finger across the aisle you have neither the courage nor the intellect to revise the tariff alas alas that i can go the gentleman from mississippi one better and reply in the language of a democratic leader uttered on the floor of this house that his party had neither the courage nor the honesty to make a tariff law the gentleman from mississippi says if you dont revise it we will what a pretty mess his party made of tariff revision when they undertook it clothed with absolute power having possession of the house the senate and the executive they brought forth a measure that their own president baptized as a measure of party perfidy and party dishonor and that the people of this country at the very first available opportunity scouted with disgust i want you my democratic friends to listen bearing in mind what the gentleman from mississippi says to what one of your own leaders had to say on the subject the gentleman to wholn the gentleman from mississippi gave acertificate of character only the other day mr tom johnson said while the wilson bill was being made we of the democratic party went before the country in 1892 asserting that the existing tariff was wrong in principle and unjust in operation declaring the policy of protection a fraud and a robbery charging it with creating trusts throttling industry enforcing idleness lessening wage impoverishing labor and creating a few monstrous fortunes and pledging ourselves to abolish it if the american people gave as authority they did give us authority and then our haste to repeal oppressive taxes subsided and instead of flying at the throat of protective barons and robber trusts the great democratic party began as it were to wag its tail and look for crumbs while we have been fiddling rome has been burning while we have been seeking offices and peddling offices the very disasters that we predicted from republican misrule have come upon the country who shall sell stamps at stringtown cross roads and who shall play ambassador at the court of italy have been settled but the burning question of the tariff is yet at sea and in the dark and now when after the christmas turkey and the new year wine we meet to consider at our leisure what shall be done to carry out the mandate of the people given us almost a year and a half ago the cry of distress goes up from all parts of the land and american citizens by the hundred thousand are being fed by charity to prevent starvation oh if you dont revise the tariff we will never was the difference between democratic profession and democratic practice more clearly illustrated than in that partys futile attempt to stand by its professed principles when it had the opportunity to do so listen to the distinguished gentleman who then led the committee on ways and means mr wilson of west virginia he opened the battle with a highsounding manifesto we begin our task by an effort to free from taxation those things on which the industrial prosperity and growth of our country so largely depend of all the reductions made in this bill there are none in their benefit to the consumer none in their benefit to the laborer that can be compared with the removal of the taxes from the materials of industry we have felt that we could not begin a thorough refprm of the existing system built up as i have shown story by story until it has cleared the clouds except by a removal of all taxation on the great materials that lie at the basis of modern industry and so the bill proposes to put on the free list wool iron ore coal and lumber the question of a tarift on coal is neither a question of protection nor a question of revenue but simply a question of subsidy to the great railroad corporations of the country and so the democratic party making tariff bills according to the confession of its leader subsidized the great railroad corporations to the extent of 40 cents a ton duty on coal but that is not all the distinguished leader of the democratic party making a tariff bill said further every reason for putting coal on the free list applies with equal if not stronger force to removing the duty from iron ore if duties are laid for revenue we could not select any duties more hurtful to american industries or more injurious to american labor than duties levied upon production upon no ground of protection can the duty on iron ore be any longer justified in this country and yet alas for the credit of democratic courage intellect and honesty the gentleman and his colleagues proceeded to put what lie called an indefensible duty of 40 cents a ton on iron ore the wilson bill made by the democratic party was absurd inconsistent and illogical but worst of all it was a sectional bill it reenacted mason and dixons line listen to some of the absurdities and sectionalism in that bill copper ingots were called raw material and made free but pig iron was dutiable at 22i per cent ad valorem as a manufactured product tennessee marble was protected by a duty of 40 cents per

maine were free binding twine was free while bagging was taxed agricultural implements were free while the steel from which they are made was dutiable ties to bind cotton were free but to bind hay were taxed in face of this bungle of grotesque inconsistencies the gentleman from mississippi calls across the aisle to us that we have neither the courage nor the intellect to make a tariff bill every splendid page in every splendid chapter of all the harvest years of republican rule and protection is his answer if you do not revise the tariff he says we will i am disposed to stop and yet i think i shall not stop here because i want to have the gentleman from mississippi have all the light possible on the subject and i want to say to him in the mildest way that i can that americafi history contains no record so steeped in cowardice and dishonesty as the record of the democratic partys attempt to make a tariff bill and i propose to prove it i propose to prove that proposition out of the mouths of witnesses everyone of whom shall be a democrat said the new york sun a democratic paper taking revenue and antirevenue together the wilson bill is a fantastic and personal hill it is a jungle of unconstitutionalities and favoritisms compounded to gratify the more powerful applicants for license to rob and to vindicate the hobbies of grover cleve and put on record previous to the chicago platform it is the greatest humbug of the age said the louisville courierjournal and i assume that no democrat will question the orthodox democracy of that paper if in the democracy of this country there is a depth ofshame which had not before been stirred by democracys alleged representatives in the united states senate within the past six months it has certainly been reached by the action of the finance committee in the latest compromise bill agreed on instead of a bill redeeming the pledges they were commissioned to redeem a mongrel piebald of patches and pusillanimity a grotesque hodgepodge of pretense and pettifogging a nondescript abortion of incompetency selfishness cowardice and treachery is the outcome oh if you dont revise the tariff we will said president cleveland there is no excuse for mistaking or misapprehending the feeling and temper of the rank and file of the democracy they are downcast under the assertion that their party fails in ability to manage the government they are apprehensive that efforts to bring about tariff reform may fail but they are much more downcast and apprehensive in their fear that democratic principles may be surrendered every true democrat and every sincere tariff reformer knows that this bill in its present formalluding to the senate bill subsequently adopted en bloc by the houseand as it will be submitted to the conference falls far short of the consummation for which we have long labored for which we have suffered defeat without discouragement which in its anticipation gave us a rallying cry

things with which all are satisfied that all of the members of the interstate commerce committee join in the determination to support this bill without alteration or amendment democrats and republicans concur in this for many years the railroads of america have been administered as though they were private property owned by the railroad corporations they have charged what tolls they pleased favored one community and injured anotherin fact have forgotten at times and disregarded their duties as the trustees of a public trust in this connection it becomes important for us to consider what is the legal status of the american railroad upon this subject there is no lack of authority at the last session of congress i was able in the brief time allotted me to say a very few of the things that i wished to say upon the subject of rate legislation in the little however that i did say i was criticised and taken to task by my distinguished colleague from ohio for repeating several times the declaration that the american railroads were in do sense private property they were built by the public and that those controlling them are public trustees owing a duty to the public the distinguished gentleman expressed surprise calling this doctrine something new something good that nobody knew before i deny that it is novel or new upon the other hand it is as old as our railroads arerecognized and declared by every court that has ever spoken upon the subject the supreme court f pennsylvania in the case of the erie and northeast railroad company v casey reported in 26 pennsylvania state reports at page 287 held that a railroad built by the authority of the state for purposes of commerce is a public highway and in no sense private property and that a corporation authorized to build and operate it is a servant of the state as much as any other legally appointed officer appointed to perform any other public duty there was not one dissenting opinion in the court upon this proposition and this was no lere dicta but a decision involving millions of dollars worth of property the charter of the erie and northeast railroad company had by the legislature of pennsylvania been repealed for the abuse of privileges and in the same act the governor was directed to appoint one or more persons to take and have the custody of said railroad for the use of the state and the question was made whether the state could take the road constitutionally without first making compensation in money this contention was upon tie theory that the railroad was the private property of the corporation which had furnished money to build it under its franchise granted by the state i wish to quote briefly from this opinion the court said the authority given by the act of october 1855 to the defendant to take possession of the railroad is asserted by the plaintiffs counsel to be an act of confiscationa taking of private property for public use without compensation if this be true the injunction ought to be awarded for no legislature can do such a thing under our constitution when a corporation is dissolved by a repeal of its charter the legislature may appoint or authorize the governor to appoint a person to take charge of its assets for the use of creditors and stockholders and this is not confiscation any more than it is confiscation to appoint an administrator to a dead man or a committee for a lunatic but money or goods or lands which are or were the private property of a defunct corporation can not ie arbitrarily seized for the use of the state without compensation paid or providied for this act however takes nothing but the road is that private property certainly not it is a public highway solemnly devoted by law to the public use when the lands were taken to build it on they were taken for public use otherwise they could not have been taken at all it is true the plaintiffs had a right to take tolls from all who traveled or carried freight on it according to certain rules fixed in their charter but that was a mere franchise a privilege derived entirely from the charter anid it was gone when the clarler was repealed the state may grant to a corporation or to an individual the franchise of taking tolls on any highway opened or to be opened whether it be a railroad or river canal or bridge turnpike or common road when the franchise ceases by its own limitation by forfeiture or by repeal the highway is thrown back on the hands of the state and it becomes her duty as the sovereign guardian of the public rights and interests to take care of it she nay renew the franchise give it tosome other person exercise it herself or declare the highway open and free to all the people if the railway itself was the private property of the stockholders then it reulains theirs and they may use it without a charter as other people use their ownrun it on their own account charge what tolls they please close it or open it when they think properdisregard every interest except their own the repeal of charters on such terms would be courted by every railroad company in the state for it would have no effect but to emancipate them from the control of law convert their limited privileges into a broad unbounded license on this principle a corporation might be rewarded but never punished for misconduct ilepeal of its charter instead of bringing it to a shameful end would put length of days in its right hand and in its left hand riches and honor but it is not so railroads made by the authority of the commonwealth upon lands taken under the right of eminent domain and established by her laws as thoroughfares for the commerce that passes through her horders are her highways no corporation has any property in them though corporations may have franchises annexed to and exercisable within their such a franchise the plaintiffs had but they have it no longer the right to take tolls on a road is an incorporeal hereditament which may be granted to a corporation or to an individual and the grantee has an estate in the franchise the estate endures forever if the charter be perpetual for years if it be given for a limited period and at will if it be repealable at the pleasure of tile legislature this corporation after its privileges are abused had an estate at will and the commonwealth chose to demand repossession that terminated the estate as completely as an estate for years would be terminated after tile expiration of the term the grant was exhausted tie corporation lived its time out its lease of life was expressly limited at the day of its creation to a period when the legislature should dissolve it for its conduct when the legislative will was spoken its hourlad come in the courts brief summary of its decision the eighth and ninth flildings are as follows viii the charter being constitutionally repealed the franchises are as a necessary consequence resumed to the state and the road remains what it always waspublic property ix tihe corporators can not be entitled to compensation for they had uo property in the road and after their default they held the corporate franchises at the will of the legislature and the exertion of that vwill in tile resumption of franchises did them no injury but what they agreed to submit to the injunction which the plaintiffs have moved for is to be refused it will be noted that this case involved a question not only of the constitutionality of the ract under the constitution of tile state of pennsylvania but of its constitutionality under the federal constitution the case therefore couldhave been taken to the supreme court of the united states upon that ques tion but the decision was sustained by fuch clear reason and such abundant authority that it was acquiesced in by the stockholders of the corporation notwithstanding the fact that it deprived them of the possession of an immensely valuable railroad the decision thus laid down by this court as far as i know has never once been criticised nor in all the numberless cases involving this question has there been a single voice raised challenging this doctrine something new something good something that nobody knew about before indeed there is not a single railroad in americaand i challenge the distinguished gentleman from ohio to name onethat has not affirmatively invoked this principle in its own behalf in lawsuits and won judgments in its own favor that were predicated upon nothing else in every appropriation case that is brought against the citizen the first issue litigated is whether or not there is a public necessity for the taking of his land and whether or not the railroad corporation represents that public necessity that being found affirmatively the citizens land is taken from the category of private property his every right is divested therein and the land is returned again to the great public domain and placed in the custody and control of the publics agent and servantthe railroad company it is universally recognized by good lawyers ever since the decision of the celebrated dartmouth college case that when a corporation accepts from the public a charter there is established between the public and the corporation accepting and acting under the charter spending money thereon a contract the corporators of a railroad company on their part bind themselves to build for the state a railroad to be used by the people as a public highway the railroad is to be built between certain designated termini in consideration thereof the state consents to clothe the shareholders with a portion of her own sovereignty to erect them into a body politic to delegate to them her right of eminent domain and to grant them the franchise of taking reasonable tolls from all who should travel or carry on her highway it will be perceived that under this status thus judicially defined every railroad company is a public trustee it is an official part of the government and ought to be held to as strict an accountability as any other department of our public service the charter of a railroad corporation when accepted and nmoneys are spent in accordance therewith becomes a contract and rights vest thereunder and it becomes important to inquire what those rights are it has been judicially determined that the right to charge toll over the railroads of the country is limited to such charges as are reasonable this principle has been recognized by every state legislature in the fixing of maximum rates then the railroads of the country it will be seen have a vested right so long as their franchises endure to collect reasonable tolls the power has been delegated to them to levy a tax upon all interstate commerce passing over their road provided that levy be always reasonable beyond this they have no right to go thus far their right is absolutesurrounded by all the guaranties of the constitution protecting private property and vested rights under contracts while therefore railroads perform their duty strictly there is not the slightest power in the legislative arm to touch them but if they go beyond the limits of their rightful authority and levy an unreasonable and excessive toll or oppress one business to help another make unreasonable exactions upon one set of shippers to wickedly give the money in rebates to another more favored they should be promptly driven back under the lash of the law a right understanding of the legal status of the railroad companies of america i deem so important to the working out and correct solution of this legislation that is sought in this regard that i shall take occasion to print in the record and make a part of my argument extracts from the speech made by judge jeremiah s black before the legislature of pennsylvania in the year 1883 that argument has never been answered it is unanswerable and i trust that i in this way may make those dead lips vocal again and bring their

a trail and then by chance it may evolve a mighty captain to raise a new flag in the glad sky and so it happened that about one hundred and sixtyone years ago john barry was born he first opened his wondering eyes in an humble cottage thatched with straw beneath the spreading branches of an imemorial rooftree i can see it now unfolding a quiet and peaceful scene of pastoral beauty a dreamy lake the still wide waters of the bay the undulating fields that spread about an emerald sward melting far away into the violet hills and the depths of blue and in the center of it all the tree and the little home filled with love and kindness where all the day was work and when the dusk came down to mingle with the light the man but not the master by the side of a loving wife listening to the song of childhoods laughter watched the sun go out of the dying day and this was where john barry was born in the county of wexford ireland no stars fell on that night to mark the unheeded event no courier of fashion heralded his birth to the neighborhood he was simply a child of common fortune born to a modest godfearing honest tiller of the soil in the midst of the idyls and tragedies of ireland the brightest strangest and saddest of all time it did not occurto anyone just then that all the proudest progeny of the world have stooped to kiss the brow of mother earth and gather manly strength that like the soil whole families may lie fallow for ages to incubate and then burst forth in the resplendent flower of genius the chemists of the earth the searchers of the mind have not yet fathomed the secret and cunning essence of the magnificent thing we call the human heart nature always conceals the detail but everywhere unveils the monumental fact so far as it is known no blood of royal blue coursed the veins of john barry it was all red and to his credit it never changed its color down to his dying day and yet he so lived and labored in unfailing faith and unfaltering courage that when the last hour shall come when the long roll is called ireland redeemed and free will stand up in imperial grace with a greater pride than did the old roman and say i thank god that i am the mother of john barry and there by her side will be america clothed with laurel and liberty crowned with her outstretched hands of kindly jealousy to proclaim in the pathos of rival tones commodore john barry belongs to us and in the glory that encircles the name of that splendid captain the red white and blue and the green and gold are entwined together in a common sympathy that shall linger beyond all the graves and through the shades and into the dawn how did it all happen what strange and shadowy power what mystic incomprehensible tide cast up this child of circumstance from an unknown sea to uplift humanity here we are with nothing to say we come without consent and leave under protest we live in a narrow vale the dawn is a dream and the evening dusky hope but i do not believe in the utter fickleness of fate i believe that in the boundless sweep of matter each man and woman and child is a cog in the great wheel of revolving destiny i believe that every act and deed thought and word is an evolution and that every condition and sentiment of life is formed and fashioned out of something that has gone before and so it comes to each of us as it did to john barry we are here through the intelligent will of the creator we are here a cog designed to fill a niche shall we fill it well or ill thats the question shall we advance the measured harmony of the onward move by our birth or shall we by delaying sloth create an ignominious discord in the universe some men solve that mystery gloriously an unseen and inexplainable something incites the soul to perform a precufsored mission and we have the discovery of the western hemisphere by columbus or the creation of an ideal freedom there by john barry and his fellows the boy is the father of the manthat is plain to allbut at the same time every man is the child of his environment one day in the afternoon of his life a distinguished warrior went back to the old times again and while there watching the schoolboys in their playground sports at the same old place where he had years ago fought and failed and sometimes came out victor the duke of wellington turned to his friend and said it was there the battle of waterloo was won waterloo the synonym of colossal egoism and of its ultimate downfall everywhere its soothing syllables hardly die upon the lip when the name of napoleon comes without calling i see him now on the isle of st helena statuesque and remorseless with folded arms and relentless face unioved by any thought of all the red carnage of conflict the maimed and the dead the guns that lay broken with the heart of the mother the swords that were rust in the tears of the orphan the graves that were dug and the hopes that were buried all for his glory and then my thoughts go back to the year 1784 when at the age of 15 bonaparte climbed the weary steps to the mean quarters of his attic chamber in the military school of paris the first thing that met his view bescrawled in charcoal on the whitewashed wall was the character of his predecessors in three signed inscriptions they were an epaulet is very long to win the finest day in life is that of battle life is but a prolonged lie napoleon read them and then added a fourth sentence the last of the chapter the end of all is 6 feet of earth and it was there the battle of waterloo was lost just one more bit of life to round the thought there once lived a poor boy reared in a land big in men and large in brain a land where liberty was the birthright and tyranny the legacy where the government forsook its traditions and statesmen forgot their manhood where the ruthless hand of man purloined the pen of magna charta to write desolation ruin and misery in the statute books of a great strong brilliant race a whole race of bighearted brightminded affectionate people where the powers of might wrung from unwilling submission an enforced tribute and then beggared the subject starved the body impoverished the intellect by coerced ignorance and with infinite cruelty filled with tears the myriad eyes that should have been as blue and bright as the sunlit skies of innisfail the lonely wanderer inherited no rich bequest of learning from governmental bounty nor could he in after years go back to the playground of a school day filled with prophetic memory he was educated by want and selfreliance by flower and field by cloud and star by all the wrongs and woes of his tortured land by the sorrows that bleed and the agonies that sear by the windswept wave and the ebb and flow of the untired sea ever sounding in the human heart that eternal longing for the freedom of its unmeasured reachthe endless music of the infinites sublimest anthem of the free this was his university except that over his cradle gilded by no canopy of pretense there hung the sweet face of her who never sleeps when childhood needs her care and as he grew her loving arms about his neck murmuring soft and low with mothers lips an inspired song that old ocean in his grandest mood could neer express and this was the cradle in which american liberty was rocked the academy of its growth and the playground of its victories yes man is the offspring of his surroundings deprived of fundamental sustenance he hungers for it with all the consuming passion of starving life liberty is the constitutional gift of the almighty everywhere without it all the wasting days are but the solemn echo of sad memories freighted with the wrecks of human hope and the thoughts of joy that might have been john barry belonged to a race of unrequited destiny who love liberty stronger than life and whose sons and daughters rather than wear the servile badge are scattered far and near in every land and on all the seas at about the age of 15 barry turned his face toward the dawn and said goodby to home and friends to erin the green banner and the golden harp forever after his home was the sea and america his country through all the troubled spirit of the

to think and who believed they had a right to tell their thoughts the men who had the courage to act and a pride that refused to bend the suppliant knee save in the presence of their maker when you read the epic drama of things human in the celebrated history of the nations dead and gone you will find all such regal souls had vanished like a dream just before decay set in if the republic shall ever become a tradition of fading memory like carthage greece and rome it will be because we have forgottenforgotten the honest rugged character of the noblest men that ever lived in the tide of times now and then a being comes down to us possessed of a clairvoyant something whose unfettered spirit leaps all the barriers that fortress and bonfine the mind to capture knowledge on every field of exploit and for want of a better name we call it genius it follows no rule it obeys no law a brilliant occult unfixed star that flashes across the dark places and conjures up intelligence out of chaos but nature never used a meteor to make a world or found a state and it made its real statesmen out of a full rounded character too well poised to be called brilliant too slow to excite the imagination too steadfast to ever jar the mind in wonder too patient and commonplace too human and universal to touch the singing chords of romance and turn a single unusual act into a battle hymn or national anthem no the stars will continue to glorify the shades the queen of night will forever shed its reflected rays but the unrivaled sun drowns all the splendor of contrasts with its undeviating glow that fills the breadths and depths of every horizon and such is the genius of men like washington and barry too broad and elemental too plainly useful in perfected symmetry to startle the senses they were the state builders the creators of an epoch their every thought breathed undying devotion their every act spoke duty stern daughter of the voice of god we know a man by the friends he makes great men have friends who are good washington refused to meet talleyrand and shake his hand first because he was a refugee from france and washington was president of the united states but that was not all second because washington was an honest sincere man who hated the treachery of craft who despised the perfidy of intrigue and all honors boughi with the loss of selfrespectthey never met we love washington and call him father he was the admiring friend of commodore barry washington was his friend and he admired him because john barry was pure in heart and live oak to the core because he was the truest manliest type of a christian soldier as spotless in private honor as he was great in the discharge of his duty because he was a man of sl epless energy who was brave and cool whenever and wherever danger summoned a dauntless warrior whose kindly nature tempered a firmness that never knew defeat and so it was when the crucial time arrived when great britain had marshaled her veteran armies her unconquered navies to wring an unjust tribute from her protesting colonies and when all but men of oa and iron who were willing to say give me liberty or give me death would have called resistance unutterable folly ii became the last and only hope of success to have officers with sound judgment and consummate skill whose experience and valor whose courage and loyalty were beyond all doubt in the quest of this responsibility congress through washington discovered in john rarry the rare possessor of all these qualities and enlisted his l felong services in one of the first naval commissions the supremest test of generalship is the ability to know and have faith in men lincoln found grant an no poisoned shaft of envy no barbed arrow of slander co aid drive him from his side both are now dead but the union survives and their names are written in the stars hood and wellington had the brain to believe in lord nelson his battle of the nile drove napoleon out of egypt a dreary failure his dying victory at trafalgar swept france from the ocean after that came waterloo and england was mistress of the seas the autocrat of nations and so washington had the genius to know barry he first met and marked him with discerning favor at the home of meredith in philadelphia barry was at that time the captain of the black princc at the age of 25 and meredith was the owner when revolution was decided upon washington fully realized the stupendous character of the undertaking an enterprise which was destined to test aot only the highest powers of miilitary genius but a superb moral courage which must needs bulwark the almost insurmountable difficulties that threatened many times to deprive martial prowess of its fairest opportunities and early in the titanic etruggle washington recognized that ultimate victory rode upon the ships that ruled the sea and dwelt in the heroic breasts of the men who commanded them the price of supremacy irt the naval warfare of that unequal conflict meant that indomitable pluck quick perception and splendid patriotism must take the place of mere brute strength and animal courage and this was what be thought upon the subject as told in a letter sent to lafayette in any operation and under all circumstances a decisive ndval superiority is to be considered ami a fundamental principle and the basis upon which every hope of success must ultimately depend naturally in the extreme necessities of a time that tried mens souls and which meant liberty or death when he needed a man to tie to and to win with his mind immediately went back to that brave irish boy captain he had met at merediths and to whom he had given his faith in mental silence those years before he made him captain of the itexington which was the first boat actually put to sea for liberty under authority of the continental congress in the forepart of 1776 captain barry accepted imhe commission with patriotic gladness and from that time forward until

again in the thick of the fight a more powerful armament and again had engaged the foe with such valorous onslaught six ships were provided for mr humphreys of philadelphia and barry with whatever advice they could get from all sources finally settled on the models the new navy was constructed on these plans and under john barrys watchful guidance and supervision it contained when built the best warships of the world they were the model battle ships of that time and humphreys the shipbuilder and barry the commodore the master minds this new navy was composed of the united states old ironsides president chesapeake congress and constellation the most famous battle ships of the war that encountered the cruisers of the french and later the english in the war of 1812 they had no naval
