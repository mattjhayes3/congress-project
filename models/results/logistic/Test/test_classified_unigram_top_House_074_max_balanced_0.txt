republican congressional committee over the network of the national broadcasting co from washington december 17 10 15 to 10 30 p m eastern standard time president roosevelts new deal administration which labors under the guise of being democratic but which has so consistently ignored democratic party principles is floundering badly its failure is apparent on every side inconsistencies and crosspurposed unamerican and experimental policies in direct conflict with each other have brought about a condition which is little short of a government debacle it must be obvious to everyone that as a nation we are now at the crossroads we have to choose and we have to choose quickly whether we want sanity and soundness in government or whether we are willing to continue on to ruin and destruction we have tried experiments in government which are alien to the american idea we have tried them and found them wanting and disastrous we are confronted with the necessity of decision i believe that now more than at any time in the history of these united states we as citizensif we have as i know we have the good of the country at heartmust analyze what has been going on and correct it before it is too late if the new deal deliberately had set out to confuse the american people it could have done no better than it has done instance after instance piles up where the president announces one policy and his closest advisors announce another in direct conflict with the presidents i think i have only to cite one or two of these to illustrate what i mean you all remember when not so long ago president roosevelt landed at charleston s c after a vacation trip which was in reality the opening of his 1936 campaign for reelection he made a declaration at that time which should be analyzed by every individual in america on that occasion the president asserted that we are on our way back and i quote because we planned it that way the president added that nobody should be allowed to tell you differently on a day less than 2 weeks ago but somewhat later than the presidents charleston remark we saw one result of that planning a spokesman for his administration declared that more than 10 000 000 people were still unemployed and that 22 000 000 were on relief rolls he threatened industry with new taxes if it didnt take up the slack but he didnt say that the new deal has had more than 8 000 000 000 to remedy this situation nor did he explain how impossible it is for industry throttled by new deal experimental legislation to possibly take up all of the unemployment slack perhaps that was unnecessary our taxpayers are now realizing what they face because of the new deals squander lust they know that unemployment has not been lessened to the extent that government spending should demand yet the president says they planned it that way if it was planned that way"], [0.014100117608904839, 0.014100117608904839, 0, "what is it that alfred e smith and other

move to strike out the last word much has been said here this morning in regard to butter my district consists of 14 agricultural counties nearly every farm in my district has at least two or three dairy cows the question of butter and a proper price for this product of american dairies is one that has been close to me all of the years of my service here year after year i have seen those dairy farmers in my district drop down the economic scale until year after year their dairies have been in the red not due to the fact that those dairies have been improperly conducted but due to conditions over which they had no control something has been said about the price of butter a year ago and the price of butter today it is only a year ago that the price of butter in this country became such that the american farmer could see his way to a small bit of profit from his dairy herd the price of this commodity traveled upward until about a year ago when it reached a point where there was some hope that the american dairy farmer could get out of the red at least and perhaps find himself on a semiprosperous basis what happened he did not remain in that condition long and it was because of the fact that during the month of january a year ago more butter was imported into this country than had been imported into the country for the 4 preceding years why was that it was because the price of butter in the american market had become such that the foreign producers could produce the butter ship it to this country pay the 14centsapound duty on it and still sell it at a profit in competition with the american farmer during the 3 years preceding 1935 at no time in no one of those years were there more than half a million pounds of butter imported into this country during the first two and a half months of 1935 more than 23 000 000 pounds of butter were imported in competition with the american farmer that is not a great amount of butter when you consider the butter consumed by the people of this country but it was enough to drive down the price of that product until the american farmer could no more see even a fair hope of profit for his product what is happening now the price of butter has again gone up to the point where the american farmer can see some hope for his dairy activities already there is an avalanche of butter on its way to this country four thousand five hundred boxes of butter have been sent here from the argentine and there are many many other thousand boxes on the way here from other butterproducing countries i prophesy it will not be a matter of weeks before the price of american butter will be driven to the point where the farmer can no longer realize a price that will give him the cost of production it has been disclosed in debate that the canadian reciprocal trade agreement treaty reduced the tariff on dairy products it perhaps would not be so serious a matter if reductions on these products were confined to the canadian people because there would be a limit to the amount that could be imported from that country it seems however that the more vital question involved in this program of reciprocaltrade agreements has been entirely overlooked during such of the debate as i have heard there has been no reference to the fact that any reductions in tariffs we give to any one nation is automatically granted to 38 other nations of the world with whom we have the mostfavorednation treaties and who give us no preferential treatment whatsoever in the way of reduction of tariffs on our importations into those countries in other words we reduce the tariff on certain dairy products of canada who makes certain reductions in the tariffs we must pay on importing our products into that country and immediately without further action of any kind whatsoever those reductions in the tariff on dairy products are extended to new zealand to australia to argentina to the scandinavian countries and to every other nation in the world producing dairy products for export they give us nothing in return and as a result every time a tradeagreement treaty is put into effect by the president of the united states it constitutes not simply a reduction of tariffs to a single country but it does constitute a general reduction in the tariffs on all products incorporated in that agreement our democratic friends have talked long and loud about what they were pleased to term the iniquities of the smoothawley tariff act they must concede at least that the bill had as its object reserving the american market for the american producer whether that american producer lived on a farm or in the cities and towns of this country incorporated in that act was what is known as the flexible clause under which the president of the united states is authorized to raise or lower the tariff on any given commodity when after an investigation by the tariff commission he finds that such increase or decrease will bring about a customs duty amounting to the difference in cost of production here and abroad surely president roosevelt is thoroughly familiar with this clause in the republican tariff act surely he knew that a year ago when foreign butter began flooding this country and ruining the market for the american farmer he must have known that he could remedy the situation very quickly by exercising the authority given him under the last tariff act and increasing the tariff on butter i think everyone within the sound of my voice will agree that had this been done the american dairy farmer would during the last year have been able to maintain a price which would have enabled him to at least secure the cost of producing this very necessary american food product instead of finding himself again in the position where he is compelled to sell his butter at a price much below that figure we may expect to see history repeat itself again as i have heretofore pointed out those farmers who are able to sell their butter at the present price are exceedingly lucky because i assure you that the present price will directly be reduced because of the importations of foreign butter now on the way here the democratic party has had control of this house since the election of 1930 they have had control of every committee of the house during this period there has been no time when they did not have the power to bring forth from the ways and means committee a tariff bill incorporating rates which would put an end to the atrocities in the smoothawley tariff law from time to time this question has been debated in the house we republicans have challenged our democratic friends to bring forth such a bill to let the people of the united states know just where they stand on this question of the tariff to let the folks back home know just wherein they believe the american market should be reserved to the american producer insofar as the american producer could supply that market of course they have made no such attempt there was no attempt on their part to amend the tariff laws and so far as i have been able to learn there has never been one democratic member of this house who has arisen in his place on the floor and pointed out where the tariff on any one single article in the smoothawley act was too high why was not this done why was it that our democratic friends were not willing to place themselves on record on a matter as vital as this to the welfare of the people of the united states reference has been made repeatedly by our friends on the other side of this chamber to what they call our opposition to the importation of anything of foreign growth or manufacture surely they have not overlooked the fact that always under republican tariff acts the free list under which any nation in the world may import any article so listed without the payment of one pennys duty has been a most extensive list during the last 10 years there has been brought into this country a much larger percentage of goods on the free list than ever before goods on the free list for which no duty whatsoever has been collected have constituted from 63 to 67 percent of all importations that does not sound to me as though we were not willing to permit any foreign goods to come into this country that does not sound to me as though we were unwilling to do any business whatsoever with foreign people surely if we give to foreign nations a free market for hundreds of millionsyes and at times billionsa year for their products without payment of any duty whatever we feel that we have indicated to them and to the world in general that we believe in the spirit of the good neighbor but we do not believe in the spirit of the good neighbor to the extent that we not only give to them a free market for everything they produce which we do not produce but a free market also to them for the things which we do produce in other words we believe that the american farmer the american workingman and the american manufacturer is entitled to have the american market to himself so long as he is willing to deliver the products of his labor and his investment to the american people at a fair profit wrapped up in every package brought into this country is hours and days of human labor everything we buy regardless of what it may be represents in some degree the result of human toil and human employment =wages opportunities for men to supply the necessities of life for themselves and their families why is it that in times like these with 13 600 000 persons in this country still unemployed that we continue to drop our tariff walls and import into this country foreign products in competition with the american products which when they appear on the shelves of american stores and are disposed of to our people rob the american workingman and the american farmer of their right to produce those things for his fellow citizens just why is it that this is done mr chairman why is it that we persist in a policy of reducing american production in all lines of industry including the agricultural industry denying to our own people the right to produce those things and then by such methods as i am discussing invite into this market commodities of like character i hope that the time is not far distant when the courts will have an opportunity to pass upon the validity of this iniquitous reciprocal trade agreement act section 8 of the constitution states the congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises the court of last resort in this country has within the past few months ruled as invalid a number of legislative enactments of the new deal in view of their decisions and others in years gone by it is perfectly clear that this tradeagreement act does greater violence both in letter and spirit to the constitution of the united states than any other act recently declared invalid by the court i prophesy that the next election will produce a most emphatic answer to the new deal majority and that the american people will in no uncertain way register their demand for an immediate return to fundamental americanism i ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks in the record by printing a portion of a table showing the imports into this country for the last 10 years i call the attention of the house to these figures and suggest to our democratic friends that in the future in discussing this matter they at least in part cling to the facts"], [0.016841795295476913, 0.016841795295476913, 0, "we are taking up at this time h r 3019 under a special rule i want to call the attention of the membership of the house to section 17 of the bill which we are going to consider which reads as follows sec 17 the secretary of the interior shall have power to select a director of grazing and such assistant directors of grazing as shall be necessary to administer this act in selecting graziers for the administration of this act the civil service commission shall be governed by the practical range experience in publicdomain states which such persons have had and educational requirements shall be determined by test and not by any fixed rule i object to this bill because of the fact that we are doing the very thing that the republican party platform and the democratic party platform stated they would prohibit at their last national conventions when they stated they would cut down government expenses consolidate offices and departments and do other things that were for the best interest of the people of this country by trying to make some arrangements for the balancing of the national budget i quote from the democratic platform of 1932 we believe that a party platform is a covenant with the people to be faithfully kept by the party when intrusted with power and that the people are entitled to know in plain words the terms of the contract to which they are asked to subscribe we hereby declare this to be the platform of the democratic party the democratic party solemnly promises by appropriate action to put into effect the principles policies and reforms herein advocated and to eradicate the policies methods and practices herein condemned we advocate an immediate and drastic reduction of governmental expenditures by abolishing useless commissions and offices consolidating departments and bureaus and eliminating extravagance to accomplish a saving of not less than 25 percent in the cost of federal government and we call upon the democratic party in the states to make a zealous effort to achieve a proportionate result we favor maintenance of the national credit by a federal budget annually balanced on the basis of accurate executive estimates within revenues raised by a system of taxation levied on the principle of ability to pay i wish to call the attention of members of congress to the fact that at the last session of congress when we were considering the taylor grazing bill whereby 173 000 000 acres of land belonging to the public domain which were unappropriated and unreserved were placed in the custody of the secretary of the interior and such lands as were fit were to be allocated to cattlemen and rangers for the purpose of grazing during the discussion of the taylor bill it was admitted by practically every member of the public lands committee that the grazing lands should be under the jurisdiction of one department the secretary of the interior mr ickes agreed that that was the proper thing to do secretary wallace in his discussion agreed that the grazing lands of the country should be under one department mr taylor the author of the bill was very much in favor of this procedure mr derouen chairman of the public lands committee stated that that was his idea of the way the grazing lands should be administered he furthermore stated to me personally that the secretary of the interior mr ickes the secretary of agriculture mr wallace with the aid of the president of the united states would accomplish that within a year that they did not want to subdivide the authority for grazing lands on public domain whether it be that which was under the forest service or any lands that would be taken over by the department of the interior i respectfully call attention of the members of the house in the hearings before the committee on the public lands in the house of representatives seventythird congress first session of h r 2835 and seventythird congress second session h r 6462 referring to page 21 of the hearings in 1934 mr white made to secretary wallace who was before the committee the following statement you have under your department an organization in nearly all the districts of the forest reserve that have control of grazing and other uses of public lands now that being true do you think it advisable to put this work under their supervision instead of setting up a new bureau for it secretary wallace it will be under the supervision of the secretary of the interior secretary ickes it would not be a separate setup or a new bureau mr whrre you think it could be administered by the same organization secretary ick s yes without additional expenditure now since the taylor grazing act was to be administered by the same organization and without any additional expenditure as stated by secretary ickes i want to call the attention of the members of the house of representatives to the fact that the spokesman for the secretary of the interior before our committee in discussing the merits of this bill stated that the department of the interior expected to set up 10 grazing districts in the united states for the perfection of an organization for the operation and control of these grazing lands secretary ickes before the public lands committee on march 6 stated that he was setting up in his department a bureau of grazing control and would have a man in charge in his department with 20 assistants and that in the field to begin with in the 10 grazing districts they would place 14 men in each district which would make a total of 140 men in the field i want to call to the attention of the house of representatives that once a bureau always a bureau the beginning today with a setup of 161 men to start this organization will mean inside of 5 years 1 000 men when we called this to the attention of secretary ickes in the public lands committee meeting the fact that he was doing today what he said a year ago he would not do and asked him why the organization was being set up under his department rather than the consolidation of grazing lands in the department of agriculture with that in the department of the interior he stated it could not be done without additional legislation i call it passing the buck after the meeting had adjourned i asked him if he had any objection to the segregation of the grazing lands of the public domain he said he was perfectly willing it was my intent and purpose to offer an amendment to h r 3019 asking that the grazing lands in the department of the interior and those in the department of agriculture be placed under the supervision of one head the chairman of the committee mr derouen notified me he would give me that opportunity we had been meeting on this bill quite regularly during the past month i had attended practically every meeting of the committee a meeting was scheduled at 10 a m tuesday march 19 i reported at that meeting and the secretary to mr derouen told me the meeting had been postponed until thursday march 21 at 10 a m i want to say to the membership of the house both republicans and democrats that if we permit the formation of this new organization under the department of the interior as per the setup proposed by secretary ickesand he deliberately stated he would not form a new organizationthat the membership of this house both democrats and republicans are administering the grazing lands of this country in a very unethical unbusinesslike manner building up a new organization which will add to the burden of the taxpayers of this country in future years still greater burdens instead of reducing the number of bureaus we are increasing them why then and now does not the membership of this house place under the jurisdiction of some organization all the grazing lands that are now being administered by the department of agriculture and this new setup in the department of the interior under one department whether it be the department of the interior or the department of agriculture that should not be a question of great moment to members of congress if we want to do the thing that will lighten the burden of the taxpayers of this country why permit a newformed organization that will make conditions more difficult for the stockmen who graze on public lands in the summertime under the jurisdiction of the forest service and when they return their stock from the higher ground to the valley in the wintertime must place them under the jurisdiction of other rangers in the interior department it is ridiculous it is absurd it will only lead to trouble vexation and i can in no way support this bill until the members of the public lands committee have backbones where they seem to only display wishbones because of the fear in their own minds that they might interfere with either the secretary of agriculture or the secretary of the interior to me such an excuse is absurd and i believe the membership of the house of representatives should segregate the grazing lands of this country in order

fighting for two great sections of the country north and south are not moved by partisan spirit it could not be partisan spirit that moved senator george there is this alliance which is deplored today

have a common bond of interest mr martin of massachusetts yes it is decidedly to the benefit of each that the other shall be pros mr knutson when secretary wallace appeared before perous if the cotton grower obtains a fair price for his cotton he will be prosperous and he will have the purchasing power that the committee on ways and means he stated that in his will materially contribute to the activity of the cotton spinner if opinion any american industry or activity that could not the price is too high beyond the figure which the consumer will stand on its own bottom and meet foreign competition should pay there will be a lessened demand and the grower and spinner go out of business and go into something else alike will suffer if the cotton spinner is unduly penalized if he is forced out of mr martin of massachusetts the gentleman has made business the grower loses a home customer which he will never a contribution against secretary wallace you can go replace if the price is forced beyond a figure which will permit through all of the magazines and the newspapers wherever the export trade there is sure to be an economic crisis in the south because more than half of the
