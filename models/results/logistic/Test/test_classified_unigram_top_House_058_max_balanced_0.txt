{"top_correct": [[0.008555352687835693, 0.9914446473121643, 1, "some weeks ago i introduced house bill no 12694 intended to aid the farmers by removing the protective duties that range from 20 to 60 per cent on agricultural machinery implements and a few other necessaries incident to the life of the farmer this bill i understand was turned down by the ways and means committee a few days ago on a strict party vote this measure i believe to be just and it should receive the earnest consideration of this body agriculture is our chief source of national wealth the estimated value of the food and kindred products of the american farms in 1903 was more than 2 300 000 000 and in the last decade 30 000 000 000 pounds of cotton valued at about 2 500 000 000 were exported and sold to maintain our international financial parity one need not be learned in political economy to know that the financial success of the farmer is directly dependent upon buying and selling on the same terms and in the same market bartering is his most beneficial method of commerce and when denied this privilege by law or otherwise his prosperity is seriously imaired to deprive him of this right in any country is indefensile but to deny it to him in this country of equal rights to all men is little less than tyranny to tax one to upbuild the industry of another is legalized robbery excusable only in a halfcivilized despotism yet we find it to be the chief rule of administration in this government since the inception of the american protectivetariff system the farmer has often been compelled to drink the bitter dregs of penury in order that a policy intended from its beginning to enrich the few at the expense of the many might be exploited and we must concede that it has served its mission well breeding millionaires and trusts by the hundreds in every period of its existence today it is holding high carnival in this temple of american liberty its every devotee from its lord protector in the white house to the billingsgate political ward bummer is imbued with its divinity far more than they are with the teachings of that holy one who taught that every man should eat bread by the sweat of his brow from the effects of this ideal republican policy i have witnessed hardships almost too incredible for belief i have seen magnificent estates which were once the abode of ba ronial magnificence and splendor plastered with mortgages and finally pass at the auction block from the possession of the owner into the hands of heartless syndicates notwithstanding they were as fertile as the valley of the nile and had they been in any other land would have been transmitted from generation to generation clustered about with the sacred legends of ancestral history i have seen the inmates of these once palatial homes reduced to extreme poverty becoming tenants in the ideal mansions of their fathers their broad acres though fertile and tilled to the vergo of exhaustion could not yield a sufficiency to appease the greed of the shylocks of protection passing to the more humble farmer the yeoman of the land i have seen him toiling from ton to fourteen hours a day year after year and his tender children dragged from the schoolroom to drive a plowshare in the scorching southern sun i have seen him die his home sold for debt and his wife and children scattered and reduced to miserable degradation in summing up the hardships visited upon the american farmer by this policy of protection i am forcibly reminded of the miserable condition to which the same policy reduced the english agriculturist fifty years ago as given in the reported speeches of mr cobden listen to what a few of the many thousands of these defenseless people said to the agents of the english government concerning the destitution to which they were reduced one witness said if women and boys who labor in the fields suffer in their health at all it is not from the work they perform but the want of food the food they eat is not bad of its kind but they have not enouuh of it and more animal fod would be most desirable but with the present rate of wages it is mpossible their low diet exposes them to certain kinds of diseases more particularly to thoss of the stomacl another ur cowmon drink is burnt crust tea we also buy about a half a pound of sugar a week we never know what it is to get enough to eat at the end of the meal the children would always eat more of bread there is never enough the children always asking for more at every meal another our poor live on the borders of destitution from one years end to another there are many laboring families that scarcely touch in the way of food anything but bread and potatoes with now and then some bacon bread in almost every cottage is the chief food of the children these are miserable pictures indeed yet i have seen their prototypes in different sections of the south within the last few years it is a very common scene among the 6 00oj00 negroes of the south who till the soil for a living the wages received by both white and colored farm laborers are wholly inadequate to provide the necessaries of life being only 10 or 12 per month while the industrial laborers receive from 2 to 4 per day for their wages and the few negroes who have acquired little homes realize so little therefrom in the way of profils that they have scarcely been able to provide sufficient food and clothing for their wives and children and here permit me to say that if the republican party were as much concerned about their right to live as human beings should live as it claims to be about their right of suffrage they long since would have been in much better conditionwould have expanded in intelligence along with their prosperity and would have freed themselves of many crimes begotten of poverty it is claimed that the democrats of the south deprive them of their votes but the republicans year after year have robbed them of their bread and they should long hesitate before shaking their gory locks again a few years ago in my home town i observed an old negro entering a grocery store to invest his days wages as a farm laborer50 centsin bacon in a few moments he came out with a small roll wrapped in brown paper coming up to me he said boss what does this mean that i cant get more to eat for my days work this wont make two meals for myself wife and six children i said uncle you have heard about the republicans who have been raising cain about your right to vote so long a few years azo they put a tax of 5 cents a pound on bacon and a few of them in chicago who make all the meat got together and advanced the price 5 cents per pound in order to get the benefit of this tax and this is why you have to pay 14 cents for all you eat after reflecting a moment the old negro raised his head with tears in his eyes and said boss them yankees am fools if dis goes on dar aint going to be no niggers here to vote but it is contended that if these conditions ever existed they have passed that the farmer now too is prosperous that he has a market for his produce and that the republican administration is responsible for his prosperity and that his sole duty is to stand pat and let well enough alone but what produced this little wave of agricultural prosperity and how long will it continue do we not all know that it was caused by a shortage in the worlds supply of cotton and by an increased demand for food products beyond the sea this temporary boom in the prices of farm products has imp~irted new life and new energy in all of our industrial pursuits thereby proving the indispensability of the farm as a factor in our national existence the dingley law has been in operation since 1897 and the most direful hardships that were ever realized by the southern farmer were in 1898 and 1899 when he was compelled to sell his cotton crop at about 5 cents per pound the following will show the price of his product on the i st day of november for each year since 1897 when the dingley law went into effect 1898 4 cents 1899 7 cents 1900 9 cents 1901 7 cents 1902 7 cents and 1903 10 cents this shows that the average price has only been about 7 cents per pound and it is conceded by the best authorities that on account of the advance on the necessaries of life incident to the reign of protection and trust the cost of production is at least 7 cents per pound leaving the farmers profit at onethird of 1 cent the cost of living since 1897 has increased more than 30 per cent as is demonstrated by the following statement from r g dun co published by the approval of the government and showing the value of a years necessaries if purchased on the 1st day of january of each year january 1 1898 72 january 1 1899 82 january 1 1900 95 january 1 1901 95 january 1 1902 101 january 1 1903 100 and january 1 1904 100 from this it seems impossible for the present wave of prosperity to long continue in the agricultural districts unless the government comes to the rescue and reduces the cost of production by removing the ta x from agricultural implements machinery and other necessaries of life the priceof which is now only affected by the conscience of heartless trusts which are largely organized and perpetuated under the thieving schedules of the tariff law it is impossible for the farmer to conjectpre the price he will realize for the crop now being planted he does not know whether it will be profitable or unprofitable in approximating its worth he must consider the ravages of the boll weevil of texas and the locusts of kansas he must number the showers that fall on the plains of europe and watch the irrigation of the cotton fields in egypt he must number the fields reclaimed from the wilderness in africa note the labor troubles in europe and the duration and destructive results of the japorussian war all these varying conditions and much more must be considered in approximating his profits from the present crop should the worlds supply of cotton be above its consumption as was the case in 1898 and which is altogether probable this commodity will again drop in price to 5 cents per pound and should the foreign demand for wheat be less than our surplus the western farmer will again realize only 40 cents a bushel for his product this is true because the price of the whole is always measured by the value of the surplus in a foreign market this is an economic axiom selfevident and can not be successfully contradicted but turn to the other side of the question and ask if there is any uncertainty about the price the farmer mast pay for the necessaries incident to his occupation the mccormicks the carnegies and other trust magnates have long since prescribed the terms by which he must live and ply his humble avocation and their decree is as unalterable as the laws of the medes and persians they have determined the amount and fixed the price of his raiment and food and with the insignia of the trusts they have stamped his nails his wire his plows his reapers and many other of his indispensable necessaries notwithstanding the products of his labor are exposed for sale in a market where the whole world meets in competition he is compelled to buy within a protected wall where the will of one or two men alone fix the price of all he must purchase the same parties who have arranged an unchangeable trust price for him compel him to pay any amount of profit they please while they sell the same articles in foreign markets where they encounter competition at from 20 to 100 per cent less than he is charged for the same we find as i will show further on that when they charge him 11 for a cultivator they would charge the mexican only 8 40 when he pays 14 for a plow the englishman would buy it for 12 60 when he pays 22 for a sewing machine the brazilian could buy it for 17 50 and when ie pays 7 per dozen for shovels the russians could buy them for 5 75 and so on throughout the whole list of articles needful for his wellbeing as a farmer n ow in the light of this showing is it not a fact that the agricultural consumer is bound hand and foot and is being robbed as effectually as though he were being sacked by the wildest band of highwaymen that ever roamed the western plain is the man who compels you at the point of a rifle to surrender your money any more a robber than the millionaire who plants himself behind the thieving walls of the existing tariff law and demands the pound of flesh next to the farmers heart who reduces the farmers wife and children to hardships in order that he may exploit his millions to the world and live and die in a brownstone mansion it is perfectly manifest that the duty levied on the articles mentioned is being prostituted and used as a tool by the trusts to rob the home consumer and it is also equally certain that the full amount of this duty under the manipulation of these shylocks is being extracted above a legitimate profit we find that in 1903 22 000 000 worth of agricultural machinery was sold to foreigners we also find that about eightyeight millions or four times as much was sold t liht home consuue id it is estimated that of the latter sum at least 17 000 000 was a bonus paid by the farmers to the trusts and manufacturers by virtue of the existing duty in like manner they were robbed on the 21 000 000 they paid for sewing machines and on the 36 000 000 they paid for nails wire piping and kindred products now if you will calculate the amounts stolen from them in this manner since the infamous dingley bill went into operation you will find that the american farmer has contributed enough to the trusts and millionaires to more than build the isthmian canal the per capita wealth of mississippi is only about 143 arkansas 144 alabama 155 and tennessee 170 notwithstanding they include the most fertile agricultural and valuable timber and mineral lands in the world while on the other hand the per capita wealth of pennsylvania is 559 michigan 590 rhode island 950 and massachusetts 1 419 why is this why has the farmer been shackled in poverty for the past fifty years while his manufacturing brother has prospered to the extent of turning to gold almost everything he has touched there can be no answer except the one is being robbed to enrich the other and too the republican party is a joint heir in this legacy of shame it is the highwayman that makes the farmer stand pat i while the manufacturers and trusts filch his pockets to more fully demonstrate how the home consumer is being held up and robbed by the trusts let me quote from an article that recently appeared in one of our journals it says on november 12 the iron age quoted american steel bars in england at 82s or less than 20 per ton and in america at 1 421 or 31 92 per ton the same number of the iron age tells us that american steel beams plates angles channels and rivet steel are being sold in canada at from 9 to 11 per ton less than the prices barged here the iron age of december 17 enumerates a great number of articles of american make which are sold largely in south africa nearly all are sold there at prices far below those charged here thus it appears that shovels which our shovel trust sells here at go cents each are sold there at 86j cents this iron age also contains information showing that the united states steel corporation was early in january offering steel billets in lancashire england at 75s per ton beducting 5 for freight and other transportation costs the trust gets about 14 per ton for billets for export while its price to american consumers is 23 the american manufacturers mostly in big corporate trusts guard their export prices so well that it has become next to impossible to obtain export price lists or catalotues in this country recently henry russell co of sheffield england deaiers in files and tools wrote a letter which says as an illustration of the unfair manner in which the home buyers of files are treated by the united states of america manufacturers i inclose you herewith a comparison of theprices charged to the buyers in the united states of america with those offered by the same manufacturers here some of the prices on the list inclosed follow price per dozen prcn files une differ enln states

farmer is being robbed on almost everything incident to his humble occupation i desire to quote the following figures showing the prices that he must pay and also what the foreigner must pay on the same articles this statement is made up of data furnished by an expert who was employed to secure the same for the late democratic campaign committee artcls domestic export spice price cultivators 11 00 8 40 plows 14 00 12 60 axes per dozen 8 25 7 20 kettles 1 40 85 wire nails per 100 pounds 2 25 1 35 horse nails per pound 17 14 barbed wire per 10 pounds 8 00 2 00 sewing machines medium 22 00 17

7 00 5 75 hoes per dozen average 13 00 10 00 these figures proclaim the condemnation of this iniquitous protective tariff policy far more eloquently than the human tongue can speak they show that this trustbreeding system is indefensible tyrannical and not intended for revenue purposes but to enrich the rich the government derives no revenue from the importation of this class of goods they are not imported in sufficient amounts for consideration nor is the tax needful to enable any of our manufacturers of this class of articles to compete with foreigners because unlike any other country we have the raw materialthe iron the coal and the timberon the same mountain side what justification can there be in longer perpetuating such an infamous policy has it come to this that 40 030 000 farmers must be taxed without limit upon what hypothesis of right is it predicated has the farmer not played his part well in the great drama of our national existence did he not in blood write our liberty on the snows at valley forge was he not foremost in the charges of sumter and marion in the swamps of georgia and carolina when our president was a fugitive when our capital was sacked and burned when these classic hills were under the martial step of the proud briton and when our northern army had cowardly surrendered or scattered like wild beasts to the mountains who was it that dared to die on that historic battlefield far to the south in order that the nations flag might be purged of the stains of shameful cowardice and might once again float transcendently in the heavens who filled the ranks of the spartan bands of crockett travis and houston that drove the bloody savage and the treacherous mexican far to the sunset planting a lone glittering star in the southern sky to herald the advent of the newborn republic w ho were more abundant in that intrepid army that marched with scott and taylor through fire and blood and scorching sands to gather trophies from the palace of the montezumas and to spread the map of this republic to the golden shores of the pacific sirs we may extend to him the basest ingratitude we may shackle him in the pinions of misfortune by unjust taxation we may rob him of his humble home and make him a fugitive of poverty in the land of his fathers to appease our avaricious greed ut remember that we can no more blot his deeds of valor devotion and chivalry from our countrys histoy y without dimming its brightest pages than we can strike the constellations from the heavens without impairing the beauty of the universe not only is the farmer being impoverished by this infamous policy at home but it is rapidly closing his most extensive and profitable markets abroad by realizing such enormous profits from the home consumer the trusts and manufacturers are enabled to undersell the foreigner in his own country and this is done with the delibe ate purpose to further satiate his gteed by destroying all free competition if you doubt this listen to the following credited to a writer in the pittsburg gazette published in the very hothouse of protection the time is coming when the present duty on steel manufactures will either be removed or materially reduced before this comes a wise management will see that we are firmly intrenched in our home markets and that no foreign manufacturer can enter them this can best bp done by so under selling him in his own markets that he will have no profits to invest in hetterments it is only by maintaining prices here that we can afford to undersell the foreigner in his own market this may be regarded as a coldblooded kolicy it will shock many people who do not know that many of our manucturers have been built up nuad it the truth here expressed has reached across the sea and the present english ministry is upon the verge of dissolution being driven from power by the cries of popular vengeance against the american industries but we ask how is it possible for our manufacturers to pay american wages ocean freights and then undersell the englishman in his home market let me explain by the same authirity abdve quoted it was stated that the american steel trust could make steel rails at 12 per ton and by adding profit we find that they can be profitably made and sold at 15 but the december report of commerce and finance says that from may 1902 to the date of the report steel rails were sold at the fixed price of 28 to american consumers this unchangeable and outrageous profitmaking price destroyed all foreign competition there being no record of any rails imported into this country during the year the germans and belgians who furnished the same character of goods to mexico and south africa at 24 per ton including ocean freights were by tariff duties to the amount of 7 80 per ton prohibited from entering this rich field of commerce the american manufacturer in order to receive 28 per ton had only to add the 5 per ton freight that would have to be paid by a foreign competitor and the 7 80 duty under the dingley bill to his legitimate price of 15 per ton to make 27 50 per ton which is only 50 cents less than his fixed price from this we are forced to the conclusion that the whole amount of the duty now levied on this class of goods is gobbled up at the expense of the american consumers by the trusts and manufacturers and that in this manner the american consumer is robbed on the hundreds of millions of dollars for steel rails used by our railways and right here let me say that this enormous profit to the trusts and manufacturers is not only a tax on the railroads but it is likewise a tax on the whole american perrple more largely on the farmers whose freight must be fixed by the railroad with a view of discharging this enormous debt and too this debt will prove an unending burden this generation will pay the interest on the bonds issued to cover this extra cost of construction and when we have all passed away the same bonds will be reissued and our children will be taxed in a like minner to pay the interest on the same and so on through all of the generations to come from these figures it is perfectly clear that on every ton of rail sold the manufacturers or trusts realize above a legitimate profit 13 per ton and we are not surprised that they are thereby enabled to destroy foreign competition suppose they sell 400 tons at s13 profit to american consumers we find that they realize 5 200 then should they sell 400 tons the same amount to the english railway at 10 per ton being less than first cost they would lose mo by deducting 80u losses from the 5 200 profit we find that the seller realizes the net sum of 4 400 rofit on 800 tons of rails plus the satisfaction of having inflicted a deadly blow to their foreign competitor this method of gathering profits from home consumers and destroying foreign competition is true as to all the iron and steel schedules of the dingley law and is likewise true as to all the agricultural implements and machinery enumerated in the foregoing schedules the sale price of which is fixed by the harvester trust organized under the name of the international harvester company chartered under the laws of new jersey in 1892 with a capital stock of 120 000 000 and is composed of six or more independent companies this combination largely sold in 1893 at less than home prices reapers mowers cultivators and plows to the amount of 617 430 to russia 1 680 439 to germany 1 020 053 to british africa 1 558 836 to australia and 15 075 358 to other foreign countries now if this is true as we have shown what reason can there be for longer perpetuating tariff tix on this class of articles it is not needed for revenue none are ever imported according to the report from the department of comme ce and finance not a dollar of revenue was derived from these sources during the past year 1903 then why should it be continued for what purpose do we retain it where is the authority to levy any tax except for revenue it can not be claimed that it is needed to enable this trust to justly compensate its employees for a business backed by such enormous wealth separated from all serious competition by an ocean and having for a market a continent at home and the world abroad can not be otherwise than prosperous and fully able to take care of all of its wageearners this method of robbing at home and underselling abroad is rapidly revolutionizing the fiscal policy of ensland that has for more than half a century been founded upon the bed rock of free trade and that great market that has been free and open to the world and in which we sold nearly onehalf of our exported agricultural products in 1893 and for many years prior to that time is about to be closed by protective duties to save the english industries threatened largely by the american trusts the right hon joseph chamberlain late secretary of the english colonies and the author of this retaliating policy has all his life been an adherent of the cobden thecry of free trade and juatifies his present position by pleading national selfdefense the edinburg review or critical journal quotes him as recently saying protection enables foreign countries to dump in england that is sell to us below cost price and recoup themelves by high prices in their home markets by this process sufficiently continued they can e~troy a pariular indnstry and then raise their prices iron and steel at present are threatened in this way again he says the old ideas of free competition are changed we are face to face with reat combinations and enormous trusts having behin them gigantic wealth even the industries and commerce which we thougnt to be penuliarly our own are in danger 5 at the present time the empire is being attacked on all sides and in our isolation we must look to ourselves we must draw closer our international relationsthe ties of sentiment ties of sympathy yes ties of intere3t but if this policy of english retaliation as outlined by mr chamberlain extended only to the imposition of duties on our manufactured and trustcontrolled articles shipped to that country it would not be so farreaching in its damaging results and too it would carry with it the approval of all who believe in righteous retribution but we understand that it is the purpose of the advocates of that doctrine to levy a duty upon imported agricultural products it contemplates a general tariff law with preferential schedules and rates to the english colonies and dependencies which is to be reciprocal to the end that the colonial markets are to be saved for the manufacturers of england and the market of the mother country is to be saved for the agricultural and other products of the colonies listen to what mr chamberlain says is the true intent of this policy if however our colonies develop further their present protectionist policy the colonial market also will be gradually closed to us hence it is wise while we can to secure preferential treatment in their markets which we can do by giving them preferential treatment in ours this involves the taxation of food what does he mean by using the expression this involves the taxation of food is it not his purpose to place a tax upon american meat corn and wheat in order to provide a protective market for like products from canada australia and other colonies in the event that he does succeed and does place a duty of something like 50 per cent on all the food products of this character not produced in the colonies what would be its effect upon our western farmers who in the year 19 03 sold in that market alone 180 000 000 worth of these products where would he find another market in which to sell such a large share of his annual surplus is it not reasonable to conclude that a large per cent of it would decay in the bins and packing houses of the west but we are confronted by those who say that if they live they must eat and that as they have depended on us for their food supply for the past half century they must continue to do so but we should not forget the fact that the wheatgrowing area of middle and western canada as yet practically undeveloped is quite as large as our western grain belt and is so fertile that many of our western farmers are flocking there in search of homes the duke of argyle in a recent article on the resources of canada says both by soil and climate canada is specially adapted to agriculture within the last few years its agricultural importance has greatly increased and when the great prairies are brought into cultivation canada will be one of the chief agricultural countries in the world within a period of thirty years canada has stretched from the atlantic to the pacific and the territory now under her control is very little inferior in extent to that of the great republic to the south and contains within itself all the elements of a prosperous future the great northwest still in the very infancy of its development is destined to give the confederation several provinces outside of manitoba as large and productive as minnesota and to be the principal wheatgrowing d trict of canada hon john charlton a member of the canadian parliament in a recent article in the north american review says in the canadian northwest as yet practically untouched is a wheatgrowing area as large as eight states like illinois where now there are a few hundred thousand inhabitants there will be teeming millions and the 60 000 00bushel wheat crop of the present year will be swollen to a figure that will mahe this great region the granary of foodpurchasing nations this being true and with a preferential right in the english market it is altogether probable that the wheatgrowing area of that country and the annual shipments therefrom will equal ours within the next few decades not only have our food products been listed for taxation by the advocates of this commercial upheaval in england but we find that cotton is also to be protected by a preferential system of taxation with the colonies mr boyle our consulgeneral at liverpool speaking in a late report on this subject says that mr chamberlain is an advocate of the taxation of cotton so as to enable the industry to be developed in the colonies to the extent of relieving england from absolute dependence on the american cotton fields in this report he says the significant growth of the new imperial sentiment among the british people has led to the desire to produce within the empire as much as possible the things the empire consumes there is now a widespread and profound belief among the cotton spinners of this country that the only salvation of our trade is britishgrown cotton to this end the british cotton growers association is experimenting in cotton growing in all of the english colonies mr chamberlain the excolonial secretary has taken a great interest in the movement and through him the aid of the governors of the colonies has been obtained we call your attention to the following excerpts from this report of mr boyle showing the cottonproducing area of the english colonies and dependencies it is claimed that west africa and nigeria have an area of land suitable for cotton growing equal to that of the cottonproducing districts of the southern states of america several gins and 100 tons of seed were sent to lagos in 1902 there were 4 000 acres under cultivation and since then the acreage has increased to 30 6acres years ago ottonwas exported from lagos to the value of 380 000 per year it is believed that cotton can now be grown as cheaply as in the united states last year an expert from greenville miss was sent to free town sierra leone the expert there professes great hopes for the future of indigenous cotton which he believes to be equal if not superior to middling american early this year a practical cotton grower went to gambia to give instructions in conducting experiments the results from the american and egyptian seeds are reported as satisfactory in the last annual report of the british commissioner of central africa the details of exports were interesting as containing the first mention of the export of cotton last spring 600 acres were under cotton cultivation and it is expected that there will be 4 000 acres efforts are

discuss a means of relief i have proposed for the tobacco growers of the united states to do which in the last congress march 22 1902 i introduced a measure entitled a bill for the relief of tobacco growers h r 12909 but no action was taken thereon in view of the fact that the evils that i undertook to remedy by this measure are still in existence oppressing our tobacco growers at the extra session of this congress i introduced november 19 1903 the first and second sections of my former bill hoping that by undertaking to cure a portion of these evils we iffay succeed during the present session of congress in securing some remedial legislation for the relief of tobacco growers the first section of my bill proposes to give any person the right of free or unrestricted trade in leaf tobacco that is trade in leaf tobacco without license or tax as the law now is as i shall show the grower of tobacco can dispose of his tobacco in the leaf of his own growth and none other without tax or license but the purchaser of such tobacco must pay a tax as a dealer or manufacturer this places the grower of tobacco at the mercy of his customer who usually is a manufacturer notably the tobacco trust or his representative or the exporter who is also in the tobacco trust directly or indirectly the man to whom he sells the leaf tobacco let that man be whom he may whether an exporter or manufacturer of snuff or tobacco or cigarettes or any other thing that we make out of tobacco must pay a tax of 6 cents per pound or more the second section of this bill provides that the tobacco grower shall have a right without tax to stem or twist his tobacco asthe law now is the tobacco grower has not the right to stem or twist his tobacco except forhis own personal use without paying 6

i said to you a while ago that when you changed the natural condition of the tobacco it is manufactured but where it is not changed it is also manufactured by the letter of the same law i will read you that because that looks like an incorrect statement on its face second paragraph of section 69 act of 1894 amending section 3244 of the revised statutes of the united states is as follows every person shall also be regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco whose business it is to sell leaf tobacco in quantities less than a hogshead case or bale or who sells directly to consiuners or to persons other than duly registered dealers in leaf tobacco or duly registered manufacturers of tobacco snuff or cigars or to persons who purchase in packages for export and all tobacco so sold by such persons shall be regarded as manufactured tobacco and such manufactured tobacco shall be put up and prepared by such manufacturer in such packages only as the commissioner of internal revenue with the approval of the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe provided that farmers and growers of tobacco who sell leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising shall not be regarded as manufacturers of tobacco and so much of section 3244 of the revised statutes of the united states and acts amendatory thereof as are in conflict with this act are hereby repealed commenting on this paragraph mr yerkes says in the second paragraph every person is regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco who sells and delivers his leaf tobacco in its natural condition to con sumers or to persons other than registered dealers in leaf tobacco manufacturers of tobacco or cigars or persons who buy leaf tobacco in packages for export and all leaf tobacco so sold by such person is regarded as a manufactured tobacco subject to tax but there is this exception that farmers and growers are not to be regarded as manufacturers for selling leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising so that every person except the grower of his own tobacco is a manufacturer if he sells raw leaf to anybody except a registered dealer a manufacturer or an exporter and the natural leaf so sold is manufactured tobacco and a tax of 6 cents is exacted on the raw leaf so you see if the raw tobacco is not changed and is sold except by the grower to anybody on the earth but a registered dealer a manufacturer or an exporter it is manufactured tobacco subject to this tax and the person except farmer is a manufacturer who makes such a sale this is an arbitrary restriction on leaf tobacco that should be removed so this is another way of hobbling the farmer when he changes the leaf he must pay 6 cents a pound tax to sell it to any other person or when any person undertakes to sell the leaf tobacco to consumers he must pay 6 cents a pouid because manufactured tobacco although the natural condition of the tobacco has not been changed at all now gentlemen i know you are all fair and i do not believe you would knowingly do anything wrong but when you come in here and endeavor to hobble anybody growing a product i say to you you can not more completely do so than has been done to tobacco growers by the internalrevenue laws of our country the farmer can shell his corn with his ten fingers as i have done but he can not take those ten fingers and stem his tobacco or twist it sitting in the same chair or in the same barn unless he pays 6 cents a pound tax if he sells or gives it away and then when he stems it or twists it or changes its natural condition and gives it to anybody to his son or his family or to the

section therof and you ask whether a farmer who grows tobacco can take that tobacco and sell it without paying any tax without attempting to give you an immediate categorical answer to each question as presented i have the honor to inform you that at the first session of the fiftyseventh congress by act approved april 12 102 section 3 the following w was passed relating to tobacco sec 3 that upon tobacco and snuff manufactured and sold or removed for consumption or use there shall be levied and collected in lieu of the tax now imposed by law the following taxes on snuff manufactured of tobacco

prepared without the use of any machine or instrument and without being pressetd or sweetened and on all finecut shorts and refuse scraps clippings cuttings and sweepings of tobacco a tax of 6 cents per pound you will not find in this section any exemption in favor of the farmer who is not privileged to twist stem or otherwise change his tobacco and prepare it for consumption this section is only a reenactment of section 3368 of the revised statutes of 1873 act of july 20 1868 section 61 and which last act first imposed a stamp tax on tobacco this provision of law has been in force continuously without change except as to the rate of tax since 1f68 section 3362 of the revised statutes and amendatory acts require that all manufactured tobacco and snuff shall be prepared and put up by the manufacturer thereof in certain specified packages and in no other manner before removal for sale or consumption an provides that all cavendish plug and twist tobacco shall be put up in certain packages and smoking tobacco and all cut and granulated tobacco in certain other packages and this section makes no exemption in favor of the farmer or grower of tobacco the definition of a manufacturer of tobacco will be found in subsection 9 of section 8244 of the revised statutes as amended by section 69 act of said section 69 provides that every person whose business it is to manufacture tobacco or snuff for himself or who employs others to manufacture tobacco or snuff whether such manufacture be by cutting pressing grinding crushing or rubbing of any raw or leaf tobacco

tobacco so sold by such person is regarded as a manufactured tobacco subject to tax but there is this exception that farmers and growers are not to be regarded as manufacturers for selling leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising you ask for a departmental or judicial definition of the term a dealer in tobacco in reply you are advised that every person whose business it is to sell or offer for sale manufactured tobacco snuff or cigars shall be regarded as a dealer in tobacco the difficulty in the way of a lucid interpretation of the statutes relating to the sale of leaf tobacco by farmers has been that such restrictions have been coupled with special tax provisions and not contained in any separate statutes the tenth subdivision of section 3244 revised statutes imposing special tax exempted a farmer from paying the tax as a dealer in leaf tobacco but he was required to confine his sales to tobacco of his own production and that received by him from tenants as rent and who produced the same on his land this statute also provided that nothing therein should be construed to exempt the farmer or planter from the special tax who by peddling or otherwise sold his leaf tobacco at retail directly to consumers this provision was also reiterated in section 14 act of march 1 1879 the statute imposed upon retail dealers in leaf tobacco a special tax of 500 per annum and 50 cents for every dollar of sales in excess of 1 000 all persons were regarded as retail dealers who sold leaf tobacco directly to consumers or to persons other than those who had paid special tax as leaf dealers or manufacturers of tobacco snuff or cigars or to persons who purchased leaf tobacco for export this in effect was a prohibitory tax against the sale of leaf tobacco at retail directly to consumers this act was amended by act of march 3 1883 only so far as it imposed a special tax and provided thatretail dealers should pay annually a special tax of 250 and 80 cents for each dollar on amount of thir monthly sales in excess of 500 per annum it was provided however that farmers and producers of tobacco could sell at place of production tobacco of their own growth or raising at retail directly to consum to to an amount not exceeding 100 annually this was also in effect a prohibitory tax against the sale of leaf tobacco to consumers the special tax provision was repealed by section 16 actof october 1 1890 this act section 27 made it the duty of the farmer to furnish a statement of his sales of leaf tobacco with the name and residence of the person to whom sold and the previous limitations on sales were continued although the special tax had been repeated the act of august 26 1894 repealed the former act requiring farmers to make a sworn statemeut of their sales and since that time farnmers and growers of tobacco have been privileged to sell leaf tobacco of their own growth and raising and that received from tenants as ient for their land withont restriction as to the quantity sold place of sale or the business of the persons who purchase the tobacco from the foregoing premises i am constrained to answer yom questions categorically as follows 1 that congress has never imposed a tax on naturalleaf tobacco in the hands of farmers but only upon leaf tobacco which they may have sold directly to consumers 2 under the present law a tax of 6 cents per pound is imposed upon all tobacco stemmed or twisted by a farmer not intended for his own personal use 8 a farmer may stem and twist tobacco for his own use without incurring liability to tax on such tobacco 4 stemming or twisting tobacco is regarded as manufacturing and a grower or planter can not lawfully stem or twist his tobacco for sat or for the purpose of giving it away without payment of tax if he should engage in that business he would be regarded as a manufacturer of tobacco and be required to qualify as such by registering with the collector of the district filing statement and bond and to pack label and stamp his product as provided by regulations no 8 pages 5 and 0 t i have already given you the legislative definition of tcrm ealer in tobacco 6 my answer to question 4 is an answer to

states i demonstrated then that our tobacco laws were so vexatious in their operation on the tobacco grower and those who purchased his leaf tobacco and the right of a tobacco grower to stem and twist his own growth for sale or gift and to sell his growing crop that the grower was abandoning this industry to avoid bankruptcy which means that if the present laws remain intact millions of revenue will be lost to the government if the relief which we ask is given to the tobacco growers and any person who deals or wants to deal in leaf tobacco the tobacco growers prosperity will be restored and the revenues remain in status quo or practically so i have read some history and law and studied both but i say to you candidly that of all of the laws regulating the agriculturist and the products of the farm none are so oppressive obnoxious and vexatious to the farmer as those which control the tobacco grower and his tobacco crop both in his hands and the hands of his purchaser indeed gentlemen they are brutal this word appears inapt but i use that word because it gives you the practical operation and effect of these laws in a word i shall discuss these laws the bankrupt condition of the tobacco grower being confessed and undisputed i shall show the laws and people lurking behind them are destroying this great interest i shall shock you gentlemen i ai sure when i read these laws to you and demonstrate their practical operation unless you have done as have dug down through forty years of internalrevenue legislation and familiarized yourselves with this the most complex portion of our jurisprudence from 1816 to july 1 1862 we had no internalrevenue laws the revenue report of 1897 informs us our present system of tobacco laws is based upon theparent act july 1 1862 which was repealed by the act of june 20 1868 but portions of the latter act are still the law all these acts were war measures of forty years ago they were intended to be temporary they have become permanent while recent amendatory enactments are destroying our tobaccogrowing industry on march 28 1862 the committee reported to the house a bill proposing a tax of 3 cents per pound as follows on tobacco leaf or stem unmanufactured 3 cents per pound provided that the payment of this duty shall not exempt tobacco from a further duty when manufactured globe 2d sess xth cong part 2 p 1439 column 2 this

manufactured in the hands of the grower if he sells or gives it away it is manufactured in the hands of all other parties when they sell to consumers leaf tobacco is manufactured when thus sold under the present law if sold by anyone except theman who grows it i will explain this more fully later mr horton in reporting the clause march 28 1862 just alluded to explained why congress should not tax the leaf or stem he said i moveto strike out the whole of that paragraph and i wish to state the reason for it we found after a great deal of deliberation and after taking the sense of the committee and the sense of the various interests in the country that it would be better to levy all the tax on tobacco which we levy at all upon the manufactured article all the taxes in this bill were levied upon the manufactured article with the exception contained in this paragraph the committee have directed me to move to strike out this clause thinking that thereby we will get as much revenue by increasing the tax upon the manufactured article i hope that all the gentlemen who vote for striking this out will vote for putting the additional tax in the next paragraphspecially not excepting my colleague from the monroe district this clause was stricken out and the tax increased from 5 to 10 cents upon manufactured tobacco treated in the next clause of the bill i will read that clause on

talking mateh mir chairman itwant now to recall the fact so that the cousentry may distinctly remember it that as the mouthpiece of this side of the house i asked unanimous consent to give up all our

a amendment intended to stab at the vitals of the american sugar trust as best we might under the circumstances an amendment which passed the fiftyseventh congress so that it is not true that the

bindineffectually but still attempting to bindthe american congress and the american treatysaking power as to their conduct in the future the gentleman from indiana in the course of the even and somewhat rhetorical tenor of his remarks asked a question he said what is the proper definition of protection i shall undertake to answer that question now and if he is a shorthand reporter i hope he will take the reply down protection is a system of taxation whereby many are robbed in order that a few men may be hothoused i by legislation into artificial prosperity as a supplementary definition protection is a system of taxation whereby capital and labor are deflected from naturally profitable pursuits and enterprises into the channels of naturally unprofitable pursuits and enterprises and as a corollary the method whereby they are deflected is by the enactment of laws forcing the consumer to pay to the artificial hothoused enterprises a higher price than with a free commerce the consumer would have to pay now so much for protectionism as an original proposition protection is not however in this country an original proposition we are not forming a new government and we are not framing an absolutely new and revolutionary change of a fiscal system but that is the definition of original protection and it is a definition which no fairminded man can pick a flaw with now there is one contention made by the republicans and by the advocates of protectionism everywhere which is true and it is useless to deny the truth of it it is true that you can pick out an enterprise and make it more profitable by protectionism it is also true that you can create an enterprise de novo by protectionism the only question left is whether you are willing to pay the price and if you state the proposition to the people as an original proposition naming your enterprise and the price to be paid they would very seldom bewilling to enter into the bargain and pay the price that brings me to my favorite banana theory there is in the united states i suppose one hundred acres of land where bananas can be grown in the open air and yet i could were i the legislating body of this country or were i the czar with absolute power and disposed to make the people pay the price for it create a great american banana industry i could put a tax of one dollar apiece on bananas which are now selling in the streets three for a nickel and inside of five years i could with a good customhouse service have created and exploited a vast banana industry it is true that a great many people who formerly ate bananas could not buy any bananas at all and some people would have to buy fewer bananas but it is also true that a great many people who are plutocrats and aristocrats would eat them because the common peopledagoes jerseymen and mississippianscould not if i continued that system of taxation in existence for twenty years at the end of that time there would have come to the front a new generation that knew not joseph nor cheap bananas and the moment sensible people came into power with the idea of revising the banana schedule these gentlemen who knew not joseph and had gone into the american banana business and perhaps formed a banana trust would come to the committee room of the national legislature knocking upon the doors all the time and giving utterance to cries of unutterable woe are you going to strike down the great american banana industry are you going to reduce the duty from a dollar apiece on bananas to 80 cents we cant stand it it will ruin us are you going to make the people engaged in banana raising go to the soup houses are you going to discriminate in favor of pauper tropical sunshine against selfrespecting american hothouse laborers let us stop a moment and follow the banana theory a little further because i am fond of bananas what would have been the result of establishing that industry merely this that you would have deflected a certain amount of american capital and a certain amount of american labor engaged in the general hothouse industry into a different channel of hothouse proceedings and instead of having their hothouses for the purpose they have them now they would have converted them into banana nurseries and the consumers wouldbe paying a dollar apiece or perhaps 90 cents apiece for bananas because the protected interest would have to undersell somewhat the foreign markets after fifteen or twenty years home competition would have reduced the price of bananas in the american market to let us say 40 cents apiece and then republican orators and politicians would say privately in newspapers and on the stump and within these walls with due solemnity and without a mutual smile lo and behold see how a protective tariff has reduced the price of bananas from 90 cents apiece in 1950 to 40 cents apiece in 1965nearly 50 per cent decrease in price to the consumer protection did it yes a reduction from superlative extortion to comparative extortion but in all this picture keep in mind one thing while protectionism lasted bananas would never reach three for a nickel because if they did that public enemytropical sunshinewould be master what would you have accomplished would you have increased the wages of labor not a particle you would merely have deflected capital from one channel to another from one sort of hothouse production to another or from a production which was not hothoused at all into a hothouse production would you have increased the demand for labor not at all because this capital and this labor would have gone out of something elsesomething that with freer commerce or with free commerce would have been naturally profitableinto this business which otherwise unprofitable you have by law made profitable yet it would be true that these people having been deceived into that occupation by law ought not to have the entire scaffold cut down under them all at once it was not their fault that this pernicious and miserable abomination of abominations in the way of a fiscal system existed they had merely taken advantage of the situation which the laws of the country furnished them and they ought to be reduced down to the competitive point of the banana trade by slow processes but brought there after a while now my friends i have given you the whole definition and an illustration of the manner of working of the protective tariff wherever it is needed now wherever it is not needed wherever a man could make a reasonable profit without a protective tariff then of course you merely enable him by tariff taxation to tax the home consumer up to the point of foreign competition and do as a great many corporations do in divers businessesrecoup from us while selling to the foreigners cheaper and so stands the great republican party today with a dozen industries which by changed conditions have gotten to where they can support themselves in the home and foreign markets both the great steel industry ships its products all over the world the great american boot and shoe industryshipped as the gentleman from ohio said 7 000 000 worth or even a greater amount to foreign ports last year now one of two things necessarily happens when this occurs either the manufacturers do not need the protection because they can vie with the foreigner and the pauper labor of the foreigner after paying freight across the ocean in his own market and if they can then certainly they can vie with him in the american market after he has paid the freight across the ocean either that is the case or else they do need the proteotion and are selling below cost to the foreigner or below a fair profit and making up their losses on us at home if they are selling below a fair profit then in order to carry on their business abroad and here they must recoup at my expense and your expense as general consumers and it is the tariff that enables them to do it my friends you have gone on for years howling about giving the american market to the american manufacturer and the american producer you have come to the point in connection with the barbedwire industry the nail industry the steelrail industry the locomotive industry the telephone and graphophone and sewingmachine and boot and shoe industries and a great many others that i could mention where those who control those industries have the foreign as well as the home market and you are still keeping the tariff up why why because you dare not disturb existing conditions as you say that is not it it is because you dare not disturb the existing tariff schedule lest you open the doors that is the truth isnt itlest you open the doors that is what you are afraid of you are not afraid about reducing the duty on boots and shoes today there is not a boot and shoe man in massachusetts who would not tell you he can get along very well without it there is not a southern cotton man manufacturing heavy cotton goods that will not tell you he is shipping his goods to china in competition with the entire world but you are afraid that if you openthe doors instead of stopping at the reduction of duties on those things the people will go further and reduce them upon things where you think an artificial hothouse enterprise would be by legislation knocked out of existence now that is the truth mr chairnan the gentleman from indiana first denied what i had said that the republicans were tariff schedule fetich worshipers i do not mean that you actually do bow down every morning and every night and erect a little bit of an image of the tariff schedule i do not mean that you take a picture of a boot or shoe with the per cent marked on the sole and literally worship it most of you do not bow down to anything particularly and therefore you do not bow down to boots and shoes and the schedules but what i mean is this that you have put into utterance the slogan stand pat why are you afraid of the common sense of the american people are you afraid of your own common sense when you are in power gentlemen tell us that whenever the tariff is to be reduced and its iniquities and injustices disposed of it shall be done by its friend the republican party well its friend the republican party is in power now with a very large majority here and a very large one over in the senate and with an immense majority at the white house a very strenuous majority of onee pluribus unumdisregardful of international and national relations of all sorts it is true but still a purely republican majority cant you trust him can he not trust you cant you and the senate trust one another why dont you go to work and do this revising why you are afraid that the men who helped you in the campaign with campaign funds may persuade their laborers that you would hurt them and that they themselves will refuse to contribute to your campaign fund if you revise before election isnt it a real nice thing for politicians to talk honestly to one another gentlemen that is what is the matter isnt it now this debate seems to have proceeded with the idea that sugar was the only thing in the world and the only thing in this reciprocity treaty or in this bill gentlemen seem to have forgotten that the duty on all articles of whatsoever nature and refined sugar even is reduced by this bill 20 per cent gentlemen seem to have forgotten that we are making a market in cuba for western farm produce and for southern cottons and cottonseed oil gentlemen seem to have forgotten everything but sugar some of my friends on this side have caused me to recall a thing that i had not heard for years but which came back to my mind while they were talking in the early days of the republic of texas some english noblemen were traveling through that country they were entertained by one of the local magnates who had settled there and he took the english noblemen down to the only gentlemens club existing at that time within the confines of the republicthe public barroom and while down there he concluded he would impress the barkeeper with the magnitude of his social standing so he turned to one of them and said my lord i believe you are a marquis in your own country yes and my lord i believe you are an earl at home yes then he said jim these are marquises and earls what do you think of that jim said oh well i dont care much about that there aint but two classes of men in this place one is them that takes sugar in theirn and the other is them as aintso durned particular now i belong to the class that has a very tender and soft feeling for the sugar in a great many things but i am very much like that man i would not neglect the real solid elements that enter into the composition simply for the sake of the sugar now one of my friends on this side said something about the probable position on this question of the greatest democrat that ever existed except he who was both god and man and he absolutely seemed to think that that great democrat agreed with him about his position in opposition to this bill let me call the attention of my friend to some of the language of thomas jefferson upon this identical sort of question he says such being the restrictions on our commercejust the situation we are in now the republican party in powerrestrictions upon our commerceunable to start de novo where we could not if we would and would not if we could totally reverse the engine because it would mean revolution and destruction to a very large extent but desirous of having freer relations with the world mr jefferson saysthe question is in what way may they best be removed modified or counteracted as to commerce two methods occur first by friendly arrangements with the several nations with whom these restrictions exist or second by the separate act of our own legislatures for countervailing their effects there can be no doubtunder these restrictions at that timebut that of the two friendly arrangement is now the most eligible instead of embarrassing commerce under piles of regulating laws duties and prohibitions could it be relieved from all its shackles in all arts of the world could every country be employed in producing that which nature has best fitted it to produce and each be free to exchange with others mutual surpluses for mutual wants the greatest mass possible would then be produced of all of those things which contribute to human life and human happines the numbers of mankind would be increased and their conditions ettered then he goes on would even a single nation begin with the united states this system of free commerce it would be advisable to begin it with that nation since it is one by one only that it can be extended to all it is one by one only my friends that under a republican administration you can procure conditions of freer commerce with the nations of the world some nationmr jefferson proceedsnot yet ripe for free commerce in all its extent might still be willing to mollify its restrictions and regulations for us in proportion to the advantages which an intercourse with us might offer particularly they might concur with us in restricting the duties to be levied on each side or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent advantages of another nature our commerce is certainly of a character entitling it to favor in most countries now my friends upon this side more especially listen and i want to call attention of gentlemen on that side too to a very interesting letter written by one augustus g payne acting president of the great american protective tariff league an organization for the purpose of keeping up the indissoluble bond of union between legislative robberies lest if one were turned down all might in the course of time go i wish to read it for the benefit of both sides new york november 17 1903 dear sin the american protective tariff league concerns itself with no special industry or group of industries it concerns itself with all industries it is supported by the friends of protection in every p art of our country and especially by the small manufacturers who have done so much to develop our country it aims to make popular the protective tariff system end has always remained consistent with its record and its principles the development of a small industry which has a right to live on american soil is as much the concern of the league as the prosperity of mighty enterprises it is because it believes that a reciprocity treaty or reciprocity legislation which permits the introduction into this country onla favored bests of arti cles which we ourselves are producing is to deny to a certain extent or to forget for the time being the great principle of protection reciprocity in competitive products whatever eise it may do can not possibly harmonize with protection nor can snob a proceeding from the standpoint of protection be justified no matter what its source no matter how deserving its objects no matter how specially advantageous as respects any present commerelal advantge to ourselves no matter what party cry is heard exceptional conditions can not excuse and will not help us the principle is denied that is the serious fact it will not merely return to plague us it is here and will remain plaguing us perhaps to our undoing no doubt of it every tariff reformer favors cuban reciprocity because it is tariff reform and not protection when we find both protectionists and tariff reformers voting for a tariff measureeond asserting that the measure is not out of tune with protection and the other hailing it as a real advance toward free trade we may be sure that one or the other is mistaken the spirit of 1552 when protection had gone out of fashion seems to he in the air cuban reciprocity will do more to undo the tariff in 1201 than a sated and complacent prosperity did in 1892 sincerely yors augustus g paing acting president hoen alert s builesonr m c w

our undoing god grant it itris trem fien s the e emyrthaty rcile is denied and it is teious an evnt fact and ta why i say this bill is more important in its remote bearinigs than in its present consideration if that great man mr james g blaine had lived and had the power to do as he proposed although he would not have done it purposely and willingly if he had carried out the policy that he had in hi mind he would have sapped and undermined your entire wall of protectionism fortifications and they would have crumbled to the ground after a while because just as surely as you take one man out of the shelter of it and his selfinterest no longer appeals to him or he finds that he prospers without it he becomes o of the great body of the people ceases to be one of a peculiar class that is protected and then he ceases to give you his political support reading further from this letter this gentleman says cuban reciprocity will do more to undo the tariff in 1901 than a sated and complacent prosperity did in 1t92 my friends on the democratic side of this chamber with jefferson indorsing our position and the great american association of tariff baronste protective tariff leagueopposing it how can we doubt ourselves i want to say a few words about the sated and complacent prosperity in 1892 my friend from georgia will remember how complete the sated and complacent prosperity was in georgia and in ississippi at that time with cotton selling at less than the laborcost of production gentlemen from kansas will remember that about that time the people in kansas were burning corn for fuel because it cost less to burn it than to sell it they will remember that the people were restless and in their desperation were grasping at desperate remedies that it was a time when subtreasury schemes and state socialism were preached and indorsed all over the west and south you will remember that because of the hard conditions of the people in 18s9 and in 1890 and 1891 they threw your party out of power you will remember that harrison himself said in a newspaper interview which i read and have never seen denied that the reason he was thrown out of power and cleveland was elected was because of the unprecedented hard times and suffering for which the people of the south and west without due reason held his administration responsible yet the gentleman from ohio gets up here and tells you that when cleveland came into power the country was in a condition of great prosperity and this president of the associated order of tariff barons and beggars speaks of the sated and complacent prosperity of 1892 why those hard times were not confined to the united states the baring brothers broke there was disaster and panic in australia and in the argentine republic and all over the world and it reached us last because we were the strongest nation and best able to stave it off but when it reached us we got a very great dose of it the entire world had been on a boom during the seventies and early eighties towns had been laid out in virginia and west virginia and are still laid out and for eligible sites 3 miles out from an imaginary town site people had paid 20 and 30 a front foot all this collapsed and lol disaster if you do not mind you are riding to the same sort of a fall now and notwithstanding all your eulogies of the great prosperity that exists largely in your minds a collapse will come the people are finding that by your laws you encourage and keep in power not only monopoly but because of the tactics which you have pursued monopolies which are public swindles and getrichquick cheats there are states which permit the formation of trusts and yet deny them the right to do business within their own confines do not permit them to do business in the state of their birth but create them under the safeguards of the federal interstatecommerce laws to do business in mississippi texas and nevadacombinations that have for their sole purpose nothing else than harmful action to the consumer there is a rotten system for you which must eventually collapse god grant when the general collapse comes that only the speculators the bankers furnishing them with the money to finance concerns that are not worth three cents on the dollar may be injured yet men who do this sort of thing are considered to be the great financiers of this country i want to call your attention to something in mr harrisons message in the year 1889 i find in his message of 1892 that he says our receipts from customs had fallen off 42 000 000 and some odd hundred thousands the net loss of revenue from all sources being 32 675 972 and some cents mr harrison went into office with one hundred and some odd million dollars lying in the treasury over and above the gold reserve and he went out of power with between two and three million dollars over and above the gold reserve in the treasury of the united states and yet gentlemen get up here and talk about the great prosperity of 1892 the sated and complacent prosperity of that year now i say i like to hear the gentleman from ohio general grosvenor he is such a magnificently bold and serene prophet i myself hardly ever prophesy and for this reason i had an old friend in mississippi one of those men who speak magnificent common sense in rather bad englishand there are a great many of them through this countryand he said john you have been elected to congress now dont go and turn prophet prophets is mostly darn fools and they find it out themselves when the thing they prophesy dont come to pass but my friend from ohio is the most exuberant and unscrupulous prophet that this part of the world ever saw i can not follow him in that because i could not beat him at it if i wanted to and besides that even my association with the republican membership of this house which is of the kindliest and most friendly character has not got me to the point where i am utterly disregardful of some desire to be justified by future events now my friends the gentleman from ohio makes a defense for calico charlie foster which does calico charlie proud and he has called charlie foster to make it himself unfortunately it happens to be an afterthought in the face of secretary fosters 1897 this order put into the record sent for by a messenger on that day and those of you that were here at the time will remember it hereit is there is no denying it forit can not be denied sir you are hereby authorized and directed to prepare designs for the 8 per cent bonds provided in senate amendment to the sundry civil bill now pending remember now that it was in obedience to an amendment in the senate the senate had provided for a bond issue by an amendment which was in process of becoming a law and secretary foster issued this order i continue to read this authority is given in advanceof the enactment in view of the pressing contingency this is dated february 20 1892 the election did not take place until the succeeding november now even my friend general grosvenor can not bring a witness into court to deny by an afterthought his own handwriting and his own statement made at that time but that is not all of this secretary foster on the hearing before the committee when he was before that committee said now i want to say to you that these estimates are based upon conditions existing prior to the late election that is what he said in his testimonynot as an afterthought nowin a letter to general grosvenor in view of influencing political conduct now mr foster can not be heard now to deny his then statement that the conditions existed prior to the election then later he was crossexamined and in answer to a question as to whether there would be a deficit or not he says i should say the next fiscal year would show a deficit"], [0.03676021099090576, 0.9632397890090942, 1, "the subject of federal taxation by means of duties on imports or tariff taxation has been discussd sooften and so ably in this country that nothing new can be said except as tariff laws from time to time bear especially hard on some particular class of citizens and it woald seem that long ere this the matter of federal taxation should have been peimanently settled indeed republicans tell us that protection is the settled policy of this government i deny it we are declared to be a free government i insist that you can not finally settle anything in a government like ours that is not just in its makeup to all classes of our people the wageearner of every class and in every part of our countryls entitled to an even chance in the race of life the professional man the merchant the farmer the miner and the day laborer are entitled to have the burdens of federal taxation fairly distributed this can not be done under a system that enables the manufacturer to sell his finished product to foreign consumers cheaper than he does to the home market strip this tariff question of all party bias take away from it the p3arty coloring which is given it by support of a great party that profits by catering to the tariff barons and the system can not sustain itself with a third of the american people hear for a moment reapers mowers plows cultivators trace chains steel rails wagons sewing machines typewriters coarse cutlery picks shovels nails axes wire cotton goods woolens shoes and harness manufactured in this country are shipped out of the country and sold in foreign markets from 20 to 3 per cent cheaper than the same articles are sold to the american consumer the republican reply to this showing of fats is that the tariff law that permits the manufacturers to thus discriminate against the american consumer gives employment to multiplied thousands of laborers who buy their living of those who raise cotton corn wheat cattle and other products of the farm and garden thus benefiting the farmer and stock raiser as well as the manufacturer but the surplus products of the farm pasture and plantation have to be sold in foreign markets if the american producer were dependent on the american market alone for the sale of what he raises the cotton tobacco wheat corn stock and meat markets would be paralyzed but the republican answer to this is that we have also the foreign market for our surplus products there is a steadily growing class of public men in england led by chamberlain and backed up by manufacturers who insist on putting on our cotton tobacfo wheat flour beef mutton pork etc a retaliatory tariff twothirds of our export farm sales go to england the tariff laws of most other countries discriminate against the united states if great britain goaded to desperation by our unwise tax laws that make us want to sell her everything and buy of her nothing puts a tariff of 35 per cent on our surplus products we will face disaster if i were more of a partisan than a patriot i could rejoice in the success of chamberlains scheme of protection for his country then the farmer and cotton planter and stock raiser here would know where lie was hurt then the partisan republican producer of corn wheat beef mutton and pork in indiana illinois missouri iowa nebraska and kansas would have his eyes opened to the confidence game that is being played on him but sir it would be a costly lesson to our people and i hope it may be avoided by a return to right principles by the american conr ss and a fair revision of the dingley law the threadbare republican excuse for keeping up these exorbitant rates is that we must keep our scale o wages above what is paid in europe we have the most intelligent and best skilled mechanics in the united states that can be found in the world we have the most improved and uptodate machinery on earth we have a greater quantity and variety of raw material than any other government we have greater inventive genius among our mechanics and other laborers than all the world combined the insistence of the republicans that it is the protection of the wageearners that they are looking after is false and fraudulent do you dare tell us that with a tariff reduced to a revenue basis the shoemakers of brockton lynn and haverhill mass of st louis and cincinnati can not compete with foreigners and yet pay as good wages as now and make as good profits do you think my republican friends that you can forever fool the people of these united states into the belief that english maniifacturers can come to this country buy our cotton transport it back to england manufacture it into cloth in the mills of manchester reship the finished cotton product to this country pay a revenue tariff of say 25 per cent ad valorem and then undersell the american production with all the skill and inventive genius of onr people with all the good sense of all our citizens i dont believe you can keep up this deception forever let our new england neighbors all do as many of them have donemove your machinery and spindles into the cotton fields where the power is free the raw material on the ground a mild climate for the operativesand you can beat our english cousins without any tariff but we do not propose to throw down all barriers and open our country to free trade we are asked what do you democrats really want what do you believe in anyway do you want no tariff the intelligent democrat who has any right to speak for his party will tell you that our party does not desire to destroy any legitimate and nonmonopolistic american industry we know sir that under the several tariffsact of 1883 the mckinley law the wilson law and the socalled dingley act large sums of capital have been invested in manufactures and we know that when the tariff law is to b6 revised no matter if the capitalist knew it was wrong yet we as legislators must have regard for investments made in view of the protective rates we do not desire to destroy american capital or american labor we honestly and earnestly believe there should be a revision of the present tariff but we believe we must have regard for all interests manufacturing interests as well as the interests of the farmer planter and general consumer but sir i may be pardoned just here in calling attention to the wise words of an eminent american mr carlisle said in march 1882 thatthe unskilled and unpretending laborer who guides the plow and gathers the harvest is as much entitled to the protection of the law and to the encouragement of the government as the scientific artisan who has mastered all the mysteries of his craft each one of the busy millions who helps to create and distrihute the varied products of this wonderful land of ours has an undoubted right to demand an equal participation in all the advantages conferred by the laws of his country and i repudiate every definition of american industry or american labor which excludes a single honest and useful occupation however much i may have disagreed with mr carlisle in his position on other questions i am willing to stand on his definition of american labor and its rights but sir we are confronted by the republican figure maker and spellbinder with the statement that a panic was forced on us by the wilsongerman tariff act of 1894 that values were destroyed all products of the farm and field mine and workshop went to pieces under that law i deny it i challenge the republican tariff defenders to make good this declaration i insist that the plain truth is that the american tariff does not control the price of the surplus products of our country i declare that the price of wheat cotton beef pork lard hams flour zinc and fruit is settled in the foreign markets of the world where we must sell our surplus products the lowest price that zinc has brought in thirty years was the period between october 1892 and july 1894 in this time zinc fell to 13 62 per ton wheat went down to 34 cents per bushel in the same time and yet we had in every day of this period the muchvaunted mckinley tariff the hard times set in during the fall of 1890 and grew worse from month to month and finally culminated in the panic of 1893 and continued until wheat and beef began to rise and went up to a living price prior to the election of mr mckinley in 1896 and this was owing partially to exhaustion of the visible supply and still more to the famine in india and the cattle plague of south america the republicans falsely charge tjiat the financial woes of our country came about because of the wilsongerman freetrade law of august 1894 free trade indeed this law was a high protective law the highest we had then ever had except the mckinley law which it repealed the republican party leaders and managers demand recognition for every good thing and deny responsibility for every evil that comes to us as a people this party takes credit for sunshine and rain for early spring and late frosts it insists on the prodigalities of nature being declared the result of its legislative enactments this party has learned well at least one lesson taught by the plumed knight and that is to claim everything sir you can not legislate a people into prosperity and happiness the law of supply and demand will inevitably control in what we sell as our surplus the socalled dingley law which is the top rail of unjust tariff legislation forces our miners farmers stock raisers and cotton and tobacco planters to sell their surplus in the open to them unprotected markets of europe and the same iniquitous law compels them to buy the manufactured goods they need in the protected home market where they are compelled to pay from 25 to 125 per cent more than they would have to pay in the markets where they sell their surplus our forests of pine oak gum and walnut are rapidly g6ing yet the farmers on the prairies of indiana illinois missouri kansas and nebraska are asked to be good to stand still and be sheared of 2 per thousand for lumber that they must have and told with great unction that this graft is offset with the protection they get of 25 cents per bushel for wheat and 15 cents per bushel for corn we sell our surplus of wheat and corn in foreign lands many millions of bushels of each in open competition with all the world no country on the footstool has so much to sell we sow a greater acreage and get a greater yield must sell our surplus to europe yet we are brazenly told that the farmer is protected the wheat tariff affords him no protection but if he wants a lit tle foreign wheat to sow he pays the 25 cents tariff these political partners of the everfattening lords of the tariff tell us that the farmers wife must have a protective duty of 5 cents per dozen on eggs our hens must be protected from the pauper hens of canada aye even though old speck can lay more eggs with less exertion in one season than the pauper hens of canada can in two but republicans demand the retention of this high protective and in some items prohibitive tariff for the reason as they say we must have the revenue to that i reply that a little economy practiced in the several departments of the government would relieve us fifteen or twenty millions of dollars without crippling the service cut down the army to half its present size and save thirtyfive millions more stop the making of so many new army posts force the manufacturers to sell us armor plate for our new war ships for less than two prices all these things would cut down expenses besides a revision of the tariff to reasonable rates would yield us more revenue than we now get under the dingley act but i am confronted with the statement that i am a bold legislator to demand a revision of the tariff when i have protected wheat and corn zinc and lead flour and beef hams and lard in the section of country i represent i make no mistake when i say the missouri farmer is not thus caught with chaff whatever may be said of his neighbor east north and west of him the missouri farmer knows as i know and as you intelligent republicans know that there is no foreign dompotition worth the name that can compete with him in this country in prices of meat lard wheat flour corn and meal the missouri farmer and stockman knows that a tariff of 2 cents per pound on beef mutton pork and lard of 25 cents per bushel on wheat and of 5 cents a pound on poultrynor for that matter 100 per cent on eachis no help to him because he knows that he is without competition in the american market our farmer reads and thinks our miners of zinc also know that our large surplus of zinc ore finds its market in freetrade england they know full well that 1 cents a pound on pig zinc affords them no protection when they sell their surplus in swansea wales they know that ours are the greatest zinc fields in the world and they know that the european demand for zinc is what controls its price our missouri miners know that 11 cents per pound does not keep the price of zinc ore at any level as i have said the lowest price reached in recent years was under the mckinley tariff i read a statement from jesse a zook one of the very best informed men in the zinc district as follows shipments of zinc and lead from the joplin district in 1903 tons value zinc 234 873 7 9w0 525 lead 28 656 1 550 0 highest price for zinc since 1897 was 55 per ton in april 1899 lowest top price for zinc since 1897 was 23 per ton in january 1898 here is a difference of 32 per ton in the sale price of zinc within a year and both sales under the dingley law a high protective tariff on zinc is a delusion and a snare i quote again from mr zook highest top price for lead since 1897 was 10 50 per ton in january 194 lowest top price for lead since 1897 was 44 per ton in march 1898 here sir is a difference of 16 50 per ton in lead values all under this republican tariff of 1897 you may convince the miner that the tariff on lead prevents competition by mexico but our miner knows that he pays very dearly for that little protection our miner has felt the lead trust grind him down by taking advantage of this very tariff to force down the price of his raw ore and the price of labor as well the miner knows that as compensation to the protected industries he has to pay for the hammers and sledges track tools wedges and crowbars bolts picks and shovels which he must constantly use in mining which are taxed at 14 cents per pound the table salt he uses at 12 cents a hundred and on table sugar over 2 cents per pound if he is able to build himself an humble home he must stand by the tariff to the tune of 2 per thousand feet on lumber and for nails a cent a pound when the missouri miner counts the added cost of living which the dingley law puts on him when he considers that the very tariff law that he is asked to worship enables the lead trust magnate to crowd down the price of lead ore he stands by the old democratic doctrine of a revenue tariff we do not battle for tariff revision because we in missouri have no pork in the protection barrel but fecause we want justice to all classes our great city of st louis is the greatest tobacco manufacturing center in the country very near if not at the head of maltliquor manufacturing it is rapidly becoming the great center of shoe manufactures i present some interesting figures in this connection hariry wood a director in the shoe company headed by that splendid tennessee democrat j c roberts states as follows the last census report of 1900 gives the value of the missouri product of shoes at 011 500 000 of this amount st louis made 8 zi 0x0 four citiesviz brockton lynn haverhill and cincinnationly led st louis at the present time st louis is making 920 00j 0o0 worth annually there are thirtyeight manufactories of importance in the state the shoemanufacturing iudustry is rapidly shifting to the west a census of the shoemanufacturing husiness of this one city of the west for 1501 will bring before those interested the sttement that st louis alone has actually made and distributed to the retail merchants more than 30 050 000 worth of shoes it is not that we in the great democratic state of missouri have no great manufacturing interests that causes us to stand for a revenue tariff buti is a determination of our people to stand for indorse and uphold thomas jeffersons immortal words equal and exact justice to all men a republcan friend said to me are you fellows never going to besatisfied to let the taiff alone i say never so long as the tariff schedules are made by or under direction of the manufacturers themselves what is the democratic idea of tariff asks the republican f olitician briefly stated it is that a constitutional tariff vies such a margin or duty on foreignmade goods as to raise sufficient taxes to carry on our government prudently and economically and that such a tariff will much more than cow~pensate the american manufacturer for the greater price which should be paid the american over the foreign laborer further our notion of the tariff is that the lowest average rates should be levied upon those articles which are of absolute necessity and in general use among those who are least able to bear heavy taxes that in general the article of greatest value on which most labor has been expended and least in use among the poor people should bear the highest rates i as one democrat plant myself on the doctrine of the supreme court of the united states as voiced by justice miller in 20 wallace to lay with one hand the power of the government on thepropertyof the citizen and with the ther to bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes is none the less robbery because it is done undel the forms of law and is called taxation justice marshall said that the power to tax is the power to destroy and we believe that this power should be used for the benefit of all the people and not for a favored few the wellinformed democrat believes and our party staeds pledged to establish and keep np an equality in taxation in view of the fa t athe supreme court of the united states has for the time put out of the question an equitable income tax we know that we must raise a large amount of the taxes for the use of the government by means of import duties we believe these tax burdens should be lowest on articles of general use we believe that the extra high protective duties imposed in the mckinley and dingley tariff bills have given the trusts opportunity to organize against the home consumer and we believe that part of the tariff prop should be taken from under the trusts havemeyer the sugar king on oath stated that the tariff is the mother of trusts but republican oraorrs say that cleveland did not proceed againvst the trusts republicans will down the trusts well you took power more than seven years ago you have had complete powerthe executive both branches of congress and the courtto sustain you where are the broken fragments of the trusts wherehaveyourepublicans buried the iron steel sugar copper and leather trusts even when the supree court recently upheld the power of congress to curb trusts and protect the people the republican attorneygeneral hastened to announce that the government is not going to run amuck f this language from the law officer of the administration was news to the trusts that they were safe in the hands of this strenuous administration when some of the protected trusts grumbled and intimated a disposition not to help carry the republican party through the monarch of the steel trust said all os well ill see that the campaign fund is kept up i am not in favor of enlarging the free list without a corresponding reduction in the tariff on the finished product and i believe that is the sentiment of our party in other and plain unmistakable words our party stands for a fair revision of the tariff such a revision as will not cripple the manufacturer or destroy labor but we do think that after all these years of stall feeding the protected industries have long ago reached the period of which mr clay spoke in the fourteenth congress viz that the object of protecting manufacturers was that we might eventually get the articles of necessity made as cheap at home as they could be imported we think sixtyeight years about long enough to wait we are for fair trade and to that end we are for reciprocal trade with canada and other countries periods of prosperity and adversity follow each other we want to prepare for the adversity that is coming we want the necessities of life put in reach of all the people against the time when the products of the farm and pasture bring lower prices we know that an american tariff does not control the price of wheat zinc beef and cotton in foreign markets where we sell our surplus we want the trade of canada we want to sell her what we make that she needs and keep her trade on this side of the ocean we want the benefit of many of her products without paying high tariff rates we believe that reciprocity is an easy way to reach fairer trade than we now have the belief is almost universal that the existing tariff law is not fair and just it is certain that it does not divide either its burdens or its benefits fairly among all the people it is true that even the labor employed in the manufacturing enterprises of the country does not get its fair share of the profits arising from the system and is destructive to other interests let us set at rest the assertion of republicanleaders that democrats are trying to steal up on the system with soft words about revision there is no doubt about the democratic position you passed a wicked high protective tariff law for the benefit of manufacturers and at the expense of twothirds of the american people we know that a great deal of capital has been invested under that law and we do not desire to destroy such investments but by reciprocity treaties and by an intelligent revision we desire to relieve the consumers without lowering the tariff to the point where there will not be a reasonable return for invested capital after paying the best wages in the world to labor ultimately we desire to see our tariff laws reduced to a revenue basis why this position because we believe that the power of taxation can be legitimately employed only for public purposes and that the incidental protection such as constitutional law would give will pay better wages to the american operative than the foreign laborer gets and still leave a handsome profit for the manufacturer but not large enough to encourage the formation of trusts or extortion of prices to home consumers there is no doubt of our purpose nor is there in the minds of intelligent legislators of the republican purpose there is a full though silent partnership between the protected manufacturers and the republican party the leaders of that party legislate for the special benefit of the iron steel wool leather sugar and other trusts that are enabled to live by the prohibitive legislation of the party and the trusts in turn open their coffers and give back to the republican party a per cent of what they have wrongfully taken from the people by means of the tariff for campaign purposes we are told by an eloquent declaimer at the other end of the capitol that if changes are required to bring the tariff law of 1897 into a more perfect relation to the industrial progress of the american people we propose to make them ourselves whenever in our judgment the work can be undertaken without doing more harm than good and i say that if the people of the united states wait until the greed of the highly protected industries is satisfied if they wait the good pleasure of the republican party the partner of the tariff barons and trust magnates they will pay these exorbitant rates till the crack of doom artificial inflation of prices by means of tariff is at the expense of the consumer it may not be good news to the protectionist it may be a disagreeable suggestion to the manufacturer who is now charging the american consumer two and three times a fair price for what he buys but there will always be a faithful few to protest there will always be some to lift a voice for the common people the democratic party does not believe in artificial inflation of prices at home at the expense of the consumer but our great party thinks we should legislate for the whole people give every man a fair chance and that will naturally develop every industry on this solid ground we plant ourselves to win the battle of 1904"], [0.03695446252822876, 0.9630455374717712, 1, "now let me give you a definition of a manufacturer by the supreme court of the united states you will find

they have not been manufactured into a new and different article having a distinctive name character or use from that of a shell the application of labor to an article either by hand or by mechanism

tobacco except to cure makes it manufactured and it is manufactured when not changed if sold to consumers except by the grower from his own raising now just think of that proposition i hold in my hand a letter from my old lawyer friend john m foster robertson county tenn he has now gone to the country to engage in farming ie writes as follows cedar hill tenn december 14 1903 heon j w gaines washington d c di ar gaines could not a law be passed to give the growers the power not to manufacture but simply to sell their crude leaf to any and all persons and in any quantity merely without supervision or the payment of any tax whatever that would free us from the licensed dealers and we could sell our crops ourselves or through our agents an old gentleman in my neighborhood was compelled to sell at home to a licensed dealer or buyer for 8 cents for his first and second class and 2 cents for his lugs he had two sons living in arkansas and shipped the boys 50 pounds for them to chew and smoke these boys could have sold every pound for 50 cents per pound while their father was compelled to take for his crop as farmers divide it that is first and second class 5 cents per pound and 2 cents for third class or lugs mr foster says that these two sons in arkansas to whom the father had sent his tobacco in the leaf could have sold it for 50 cents per pound if they had been allowed by the law to do so while the old father at home sold the balance of the crop for 8 cents for his first and second class and 2 cents for his lugs for these sons to have sold this tobacco this gift they would have been compelled to qualify as manufacturers and pay 6 cents per pound if they sold to consumers and the reason why the father practically gave his tobacco away at 8 and 2 cents when it cost him 6 cents to raise it was because there is no competition in buying the tobacco trust being the only purchaser they raise little tobacco in arkansas and many other states they all raise more or less laborers black and white prefer the homespun leaf or twist because it is cheap and pure and can ordinarily be bought at 15 and 20 cents per pound according to locality in nonproducing communities it is higher otherwise lower the manufactured tobacco sells at 20 40 and 50 cents per pound it is not pure tobacco it is doctored with liquor molasses sugar taffy and heaven knows what else and inhabited with a few microbes the bacteriologists will tell you i would say to my friend from wisconsin that there is free trade in tobacco wheat and all other agricultural products but there is no free trade in leaf tobacco the grower can sell his own crop to anybody anywhere free of tax but he can not buy other crops and sell free of tax and other limitations and when any person except

armed all the time for a race fight that might come up at any moment with the white mans sway came the sway of law and order and the disappearance of social and industrial anarchyinseparable from negro rule the south began to grow rich by labor as must all people if they grow rich at all the gentleman from connecticut quoted a moment ago something from rudyard kiplings poem lest we forget can not you all of you remember the condition that we were in down in that country so long and can not you understand that we are careful today lest we forget the dose that you gave us before and the dose that a great many of you frankly confess that you would give us today if you had the power my friends it is a strong observation to make and i make it not from any quasiofficial standpoint but i make it simply myself and i say it is true that any man who can look all over that beautiful southland now happy now industrious where all its prosperity has come from its own labor its own moderation its own conservatism and its own gentleness of heart under great provocation and temptation and after studying and understanding its condition tell us that there ought to be unlimited unrestricted and unmodified manhood suffrage is either a fool because he does not understand the condition of things existing there after seeing them or else he is an irreconcilable bourbon because he does not wish to understand them or else a knave because understanding them and knowing what would follow in the wake of his abstraction or hatred he does not care so much for that now my friends i will come to the

change now what do you gentlemen say you come here and say that that department has lied about you you say that that department has published a malicious slander against the membership of this house you say that that great department did it on purpose and with malice aforethought and then you say to the membership of this house we will appoint a committee to investigate you who have been so cruelly slandered but when it comes to an investigation of that department that issued the slander it must be done by itself are you going to say to the country that the department that lied about you tells the truth about its own misdemeanors did you not approve with uproarious applause the following statements as they fell from the lips of the distinguished republicau leader from ohio mir speaker what is thispaperhere for what doesthat document mean what was its purpose has the country wrongly construed the presence of this infamous document in this house has this house with the serious faces that i see about me misunderstood the purpose and purport of that document is this a little trifling matter thrown in here by the understanding of somebody who does not know any better or is it a designedly willful and malicious libel upon 191 members of the house and senate and again when at the conclusion of his remarks he said i quit where i began i say that the purpose and intent of that document can have no other effect it was born for that purpose it was conceived in sin and born in iniquity and it has traveled its guilty course until it has struck the public of the lonited states as a great attack upon a body of men which i believe in all sincerity as free from wrongdoing corruption crine or irregularity of conduct as any equal number of men on the face of the earth the loud applause the stenographer has noted came as much from your side of the chamber as from ours now you propose to say to the country the department which published that document about you is the purest and the best on earth and more capable than even yourselves of examining into its own iniquities and yet that is the position you are prepared to take before the country gentlemen i am a partisan and a party man i recognize party fealty as not only the right but the duty of a member of congress but when the honor of the membership of this house when the honor and the welfare of the people of the united states aye and of an honest and honorable management of a great department of this country is involved it is above all demands of partisanship or party fealty the american people are not an hysterical people you need not be afraid that the american people will censure any member of this congress for going to the department and demanding his rights and the rights of his constituents the american press is not a press of yellow journalism in the first blush and heat of this discussion before the facts were published some great newspapers without knowing all the facts may have had editorials reflecting improperly upon honorable men but when they have had an opportunity to examine the facts they will exonerate and exculpate every man that only did his duty and any man that did what he ought not to have done ought not to be exculpated but i submit to you gentlemen of the majority of this house the american people are going to demand at your hands an honest a thorough and an efficient examination into the affairs of that department that you have published to the country as being guilty of perpetrating a malicious slander upon your membership gentlemen can it hurt you or the department i say here and now that the sunlight of publicity never has hurt an honest man or an honest department if in dark and noisosne places there is an unwholesome and unhealthy growth the sunlight of publicity will kill it if it is an honest and wholesome growth that sunlight will only make it blossom into a better fruition for the service of the people of this country let me say in

rebellion and who had reached the age of 62 years should become entitled to a pension of 8 a month that everyone who had become 66 years of age should be entitled to 10 a month and everyone who had reached the age of 70 years should be entitled to a pension at the rate of 12 a month this measure the house declined or at least failed to enact whereupon the secretary of the interior by an order dated march 15 1904 decreed that its terms should nevertheless govern the pension office and vasts sums of money are now actually paid out of the treasury without any other warrant of authority than this order or decree of the interior departmen now i want it understood that this resolution is not intended to question the policy of paying liberal pensions to the veterans of the late war i want to see liberal provision generous provision made for their declining years but i do insist and i hope this house will insist that whatever provisions be made for them shall be made by the congress of the united states and not by any selfconstituted authority i would prefer to see every veteran enjoying a pension of a thousand dollars a day voted to him by the congress of the united states rather than see him draw one dollar through a usurpation of our authority by an executive officer especially such a usurpation as thisnot attempted by the chief executive but by a deputy of one of his deputies sir i think we are now at the parting of the ways where we must decide between a total surrender and a resolute assertion of our authority if this order be sustained by this body if this action of the secretary of the interior be declared by ourselves a proper exercise of executive authority what fragment or shadow of authority is left to the house of representatives what power confided to this body by the constitution may not any executive officer usurp and exercise it is proper that i should state here the defense which the secretary of the interior has seen fit to offer for his action his course was challenged by a resolution of the senate and in a letter to the president pro tempore he pleads in justification of it first that this order is authorized by precedents established in 1893 and secondly that it does not constitute an expenditure of money by executive decree but merely interprets an appropriation made by the congress of the united states sir the pretense that this action of the secretary amounts merely to an interpretation of existing laws is a hollow mockerya play upon wordsa palpable equivocationutterly inconsistent with any regard for the intelligence of this house that this order is an usurpation of legislative power and was known to be such by its author appears clearly from the terms in which it is expressed in paragraph 3 1 find these words this order shall take effect margh 13 1504 and shall not be deemed retroactive what is interpretation it is a mere declaration of what words mean and the meaning of words remains always the same sir when the author of this order directed that it should not be retroactive he confessed that he knew he was not interpreting a law but that he was assuming to give his own decree the force of a lawthat this order was not an interpretation of a legislative enactment but an usurpation of legislative power if this order merely interprets a law by what authority does this executive officer place two interpretations on one law and prescribe the time in which each interpretation shall operate by what principle of interpretation does he assume the right to direct that a statute shall mean one thing after a certain date and something different before it any attempt to direct that words affecting public functions shall be construed in a sense different from their ordinary meaning is not interpretation but legislation for there is but one power capable of giving words any special significance in their relation to government and that is the sovereign power which makes the laws of that government interpretation of a statute law is precisely similar to the interpretation of any other lawof any physical or moral law sir isaac newton discovered the law of gravitationthat is to say he interpreted it from certain physical manifestations what would have been thought of newton if he had undertaken to limit the law of gravitation either in the manner of its operation or in the period of its application to claim that he could make it applicable only to the particular apple which he saw fall or to such apples as might fall after his interpretation brushing aside as unworthy of serious consideration this palpable attempt to play upon words let us consider the constitutional significance of the act which this resolution challenges does it or does it not violate the substantial provisions of the constitution sir the constitution is not a mere provision for the etiquette which should govern intercourse between the executive and the legislative bodies it establishes substantial powers and distributes them among different departments it provides for the performance of certain important and welldefined functions by certain agencies specifically created and clearly named the one important thing which the constitution has provided in relation to the disposition of public funds is that no money shall be paid out of the treasury except by authority of congress given in the form of a law the thing which is done by this order is an opening of the treasury and a lavish disbursement of its contents by an executive officer not merely without authority of congress but in the teeth of a refusal by congress to authorize that very disbursement the secretary of the interior tells us that the amount which will be distributed by this order every year is 5 400 000 but his computation is based on the assumption that every person added to the pension list shall be entitled only to the minimum amount the gentleman from indiana the senior minority member of the committee on invalid pensions after a much more careful computation reaches the conclusion that this order will entail an additional expense upon the government of 15 250 000 every year now whether it be the greater or the lesser sum affects the result to the treasury but not the essential character of this assault upon the privileges the powers and duties of congress even the sum named by the secretary of the interior if capitalized according to any system of tables used by actuaries would reach the enormous amount of 30 000 000 and according to the much more reasonable figures of the gentleman from indiana it would amount to a sum three times larger thirty millions of dollars taken from the treasury without any authority from congress by the mere stroke of a pen in the hands of the secretary of the interior is the substantial sinister fact with which this body must deal if it have any concern for its own dignity or its duty i appeal to members on both sides of the house and ask them to consider the enormity of this spectacle presented by an executive officer taking from the treasury vast sums of money on the palpably ridiculous plea that he is interpreting a law which he himself has been administering under a totally different interpretation while at the same time declaring that this new interpretation shall not apply to its former administration in other words a ministerial officer undertakes to give and maintain two wholly inconsistent interpretations of one law at the same time applying one interpretation to persons reaching a certain age before the 13th of march and the other to men reaching the same age after that date i ask the house to say whether such conduct is consistent with any respect for the powers and privileges which the constitution has vested in itprivileges not given us for our own glorification or for our own importance but for the security of law for the permanency of liberty for the safety of this government itself i believe that no feature of our constitutional evolution has attracted more widespread attention than the steady decline of the house cf representatives to measure in some degree the extent of this decline we have but to contrast the amount of notice which the proceedings of this body obtain from the daily press today and the amount which was bestowed upon them when you sir first became a member of this house then every metropolitan daily devoted a whole page to reports of congressional debate today there is not a paper outside of washington that gives more than one or two paragraphs to our entire proceedings why has this decline come upon us why has this decrepitude overtaken us sir this decline is not apparent to me alone it has been lucidly stated in an admirable magazine article by the gentleman from massachusetts and i believe sir it was lamented in expressive language by yourself in the closing days of the last session when you uttered words that may be fairly held to constitute a pathetic dirge over the lost prestige of the houselost through forbearance and concessions which amount almost to pusillanimity and disloyalty on the part of our members i suppose in every government there is a constant tendency to change the division of powers by our constitution into three departments instead of checking this tendency as its framers supposed seems to have promoted it both the executive and judicial departments have steadily augmented their powers and their growth has been at the expense of the legislative department the growth of the judiciary springs from the assumption by it of certain powers not specifically granted by the constitution but exercised with such wisdom that its course in assuming them has been universally accepted as the decisive cdntiributi6n of this republic to the civilization of the world the executive department has grown enormously it has proved itself to be entirely free from restraint except what the president himself chooses to acknowledge constitutional limitations so far as the president is concerned may furnish convenient excuses for refusing requests which he does not wish to grant they form no restraint on any disposition which he wishes to gratify there can be no stronger illustration of this than the disrespect and absolute contempt which have overwhelmed the constitutional provisionone of the most important in the whole instrumentwhich confers on congress the power to declare war when the constitution declared that congress alone could declare war it was universally believed that the power to sheathe or unsheathe the sword was confided to the legislative department in practical operation however congress has no such power the president allows us the privilege of declaring war if we want to do so but he makes war when he chooses and although his bellicose performances in various parts of the globe are solemnly declared not to be war the character of these exercises remains precisely the same our recent history has shown conclusively that a declaration of war is by no means necessary to the invasion of foreign territory the capture of cities and the slaughter of men we have therefore an executive department with no limitation upon its power except what the incumbent chooses to acknowledge for the only power of discipline that congress possesses is the power of impeachment i am quite sure the house will agree that effective exercise of that power is practically impossible while impeachment is almost certain to fail it will never be attempted for statesmen in every country and under every condition hesitate to engage in enterprises which carry no prospect of success we have therefore sir an executive departmeit growing enormously and growing in spite of all limitations and a judicial departmentgrowing in a new field of usefulness with great advantage to this country and with beneficent results to civilization while at the sa time the legislative department is steadily declining both in actual power and in popular regard but sir while the legislativ department as a whole is decaying one branch of it has acquircd an importance which the framers of the constitution never conceived by strenuously asserting its right to share in the executive power the senate has succeeded in creating for itself an entirely new field of authority more than sufficient to balance any loss that it sustains through the decay of congressional importance and at the same time it has successfully invaded the privileges of this house until it has practically made itself the controlling force in the restricted field still left to the leglslative department and so sir on all sides we have growth except here and here we are sinking rapidly every day into the mere shadow of a representative body sir it is true this house is in no danger of violent invasion the object of invasion would be usurpation and why should we be invaded so long as we continue to surrender abjectly without a struggle everything which an invader could covet if this invasion of the interior department be allowed to pass unrebukednay more if the house itself shall approve of itthere will not be enough left of our authority to justify an invader in taking the trouble to disperse us sir in the history of mankind two legislative bodies have in their progress and in their fates strikingly sho~vn the conditions under which parliamentary institutions flourish and those under which they decay from that history one fact emerges clear conspicuous convincing it is that representative bodies which have shown themselves amenable to outside influences supine under aggression careless of their privileges have quickly lost their importance and their powers even though they have been permitted to survive as empty forms in a system which they could no longer affect in any degree the roman senate survived in form for three centuries the loss of all its power and consequence because it never ventured to assert its rights but remained always the obedient humble servant of the executive on the other hand the english house of commons has been violated its members have been imprisoned its doors have been closed it has been suppressed its forms have been stolen and its powers exercised by a king through creatures of his own but never for an instant did its members cease to assert its privileges its right to control expenditures and when that right was at last conceded its triumph was so complete that today its authority is supreme throughout the state while the exercise of that authority has proved so beneficent that all over the world patriots are striving to make the english parliamentary constitution the model of their own political institutions in england when cromwell undertook to substixxxmii287 tute personal authority for representative government his very first step was to disperse the house of commons by force and when he directed that the mace be taken away he confessed the awe which it inspired by the contemptuous terms in which he felt bound to describe it if we continue to decline we will soon reach such a condition of decay that if some dictator should arise in this country he will not order the removal of that mace nor describe it as a bauble for the house will have sunk so low that neither itself nor the emblem of its dignity and authority would be worth the trouble of characterization or removal sir itis not too late to decide whether we will take for our model the roman senate or the english house of commons which destiny shall we choose for this house shall we become a great growing force in the civilization of the age a dominant force in the political system of this country or shall we sink steadily lower and ever lower until we become about as important as the electoral college until to be a member of this house will mean about the same as to be a presidential elector there is one signal service which the gentleman from massachusetts has rendered to this discussion he has pointed out that the decline of the house unmistakable and undeniable though it be is not due to any decline in the ability or loyalty or diligence of its members he says and says with perfect truth that taking the average of industry and capacity in this house it will compare favorably with any body that ever assembled in this country even with the great convefition which framed our constitution in that judgment sir i concur most heartily and unreservedly it is perhaps the pleasantest experience i can recall that returning to this body after an absence of nine years when the critical faculties are sharpened by age and by experience instead of finding the membership below what my recollections of it had suggestedand memory is proverbially more delusive than hopei find the average higher than even these recollectionsembracing the pleasantest years of my whole lifehad led me to expect i came here and was sworn in the very day that the postoffice department bill was under discussion i have never known a higher plane of parliamentary excellence and i have witnessed the proceedings of nearly every important legislative body in christendom from this wide observation i can say sir without any attempt at flattery or exaggeration that not in the whole world is there a body that compares with this in the loyalty of its members to their duty in their fairness toward each other in their quickness to recognize merit and their generosity in rewarding it in all other legislative bodies circumstances ulterior to the house affect the standing of the members if a man be the heir to a ducal title or to a princely house if he beidentified with prominent interests of race or property or dynasty or religionall these circumstances affect him not perhaps very seriously but quite palpably and serve to differentiate him from other members representing nothing but the will of their constituents here every man stands absolutely upon his merits as these merits are shown on this floor no matter what reputation he may have acquired outside of the house no matter how distinguished he may have become in literature in professional or in business life no man unless his performance in this house be meritorious can hold its attention for more than a moment this house unlike other legislative bodies is never rude or discourteous it never coughs a man down it never jeers him it never seeks to prevent him by interruptions from expressing his views it always cheerfully gives him the floor the eye of the speaker the attendance of a page the prompt service of a stnographereverything but attention that it reserves for its favorites and its favor always depends absolutely upon the performance of each man on this floornot on what he has been not on anything that he has done but on what he is doing here in the presence of the members within their hearing and sir their rewards are proportioned to the value which they place on his contribution to their proceedings and to the discussions of the country sir the gentleman from massachusetts in his praise of the house has fallen rather below the truth than exaggerated it as i survey this chamber as i invoke my own memories of it to say nothing of its historical associations as i realize what it has been and picture what it should be and then reflect on what it is and what it will be unlessits decay is checked the possibility of a great national tragedy is foreshadowed which if it be accomplished will constitute one of the saddest calamities in all history sir i believe that the framers of our constitution never intended that this body should sink into the condition of a mere formal assembly ratifying if it wishes the decrees of other departments but contemptuously ignored if it undertakes to exercise an independent judgment i believe they intended that this should be not only an important but the principal body in our whole political system i believe the constitution gives us the power by which the dignity and consequence we have lost can all tbe regained aye sir by which we can rise to a greaterpowerthan this house has ever exercised which can be used for the broader welfare of this republic the greater security of liberty ithe wider progress of humanity now how is itthat the senate has gained at the expense of this body how is it thatit has grown to the extent mentioned and described by the gentleman from massachusetts and lamented sit by you in the closing daysof the last congress why sir the explanation is simple it is but a new illustration of a truth which all parliamentary history establishes the senate is persistent in asserting its rights and for that reason it 1has been successful inenlarging them this house has been remiss in asserting its rights and for that reason its aights have steadilydeclined when the constitution gave this house the power to originate revenue bills and provided that not a penny of the revenue raised on its initiative could be spent without its consent it gave the house all ithe power that could possibly beplaced in its hands if it has declined in importance it has not been through lack of power but through lack of determination to exercise the power wnioh it possisses if notwlthstanding the possession of ample powers the importance of the house has nevertheless declined members may well ask what is the remedy for its decay you sir expressed the hope that public opinion would come to the rescue of this house and reestablish its authority public opinionwhatis it whore is its source where is its sanctuary how does it find expression why sir the public opinion of the united states is here we are its creation its voice its agents its ministers public opinion is the sacred fire of our constitutional system this house was created to be its depository the very sanctuary of our constitutional temple we are the priests you sir the high priest to whom it is intrusted we can not escape responsibility for the method in which our sacred trust is discharged and that trustis to voice the public opinion by which we have been created repre sentatives of the american people charged todefend the igovernment of which this body should be the bulwark if public opinion is to rescue the house we ourselves finust be the agencies to make it effective i have referred to invasions by the senate while the actual matter touched bythis resolution is an invasion of our power by an executive department but sir all invasions are intimately connected one that is suffered becomes the source of many this last assault is the most grievous that ever has been perpetrated upon us butit is the legitimate consequence of the concessions which we have made of the impunitywith which the other branches of the government have for a long time attacked us and their success in compellingour submission what then is the remedy turningto history we findin every page the story of how representativebodies have grown and how they have decayed the actual importance of representative bodies does not depend on the extent of the powers which they possessed originally for throughout europe they started with almost identical power and some have grown while others have declined according as they asserted these powers or neglected them the whole growtb of representative government in england as hallam declares in his constitutional history is due to the indomitable resolution with which the house of commons always asserted the right to absdlute control over the purse by always asserting authority over the purse the commons were able to make the king have recourse to them at xecurring intervals for supplies to maintain his government and the condition on which these supplies were granted was always some concession to the subject this system of annexing conditions to appropriations or grants of money is the foundation on which all parliamentaryimportance has been built concessions wrung in this manner fron the crown are the monuments of englands progress to constitutional liberty nothing was ever permitted to divert the english parliament from continually asserting its right to control expenditures the weakness of some kings gave opportunities to the commons for exacting concessions which they always improved no glamour of conquest or war could make them relax their vigilance in defending their privileges or in seeking to extend them one of the most important features of the great charter wasan acknowledgment by king john that the parliament of england was alone competent to impose taxation recognition of that same principle was imposed tn king edward the first although his xeign was a period of great prosperity made memorable by the annexation of wales and what was supposed to be the conquest of scotland during the reign of edward the third notwithstanding the glory which that monarchhad won by successfli invasion of france by the capture of calais the victories of cressy and poitiers by the spectacle of a french king riding captive through london despite th splendor of all these conquests and victories and glories the house of commons wrung from that king twenty different times the recognition of its exelusive control over the public pursean authority which this petty ofcer of the interior departmentdenies to the representatives of the american people in england every attempt to appropriate money without the consent of the parliament always resulted in awakening on the spot a resistance before which every king recoiled but one and he paid on the scaffold a dreadful price for his temerity here it is notonly attempted but disbursements of money are actually being made at this moment to an amount exceeding ten times the largest exactions ever attempted by an english sovereign and instead of protesting or resisting we are asked by the committee on rules to declare it is exactly thetreatment to which we are entitled henry vi the most powerful and autocratic monarch that ever sat on the english throne was strong enough to change a national religion be was strong enoughto suppress monastic institutions lie was strong enough to put away his wives and occasionally to chop off their heads he was strong enough to burn protestants as heretics for denying the doctrine of transsubstantiation and at the same time to hang catholics for acknowledging the spiritual authorityof the pope hecould send sir thomas more and the eavi of surrey the best and noblest of england to the scaffold without provoking the slightest murmur from his subjects bat the moment heessayed to placehis hands upon their possessions and to demand a sixth without i he intlrvention of parliament that moment the whole countryas one man arose in protest peasants who were not supposed to dream that government could ever be questioned showed thatthey knew where to find weapons of tesistance and that they were ready to wield them and this lking who hadshed blood like water who had taken the lives of his subjects with impumity the moment he tried totake theirproperty withoutthe consentof parliament awakened such a storm that he found himself forced to recede from the attempt mot merely to save his popularity but to save his throne if not to save his life but sir we are told that here no one denies the right of congress to control appropriations and this isquite true the right is not denied it is simply disregarded and we are offered some verbal acknowledgments more or less abstract in lien of the substantial rights which have been ravished from us the ruin of parliamentary institutions has seldom been attempted by open attack the most formidable attempts by the crown to usurp control of thepurse in england wereot made in open defiance of parliamentary privileges generally they were disguised under attratctive phrases very similarto theone usedto cloak the usu pation of which i complain in the name of us all in the name of the majoity here even more fervently than in the name of the minority for in an especial degree you gentlemen of the majority are responsible for the faithful custody of the powers intrusted to this house after the english kings found it tnsafe openly to attempt any exercise of the power to levy taxes without the consent of pariament for several centuries theycontinued their efforts to seize the propertyof their subjects but instead of calling each exaction ataxtheycalled it a loan or a benevolence a loan which there was no intention to repay a benevolence which the ben yolent were forced to extend as a e ry wi ty and learned author has said when the kings found it was no longer safe toseizetheir subjects property by plunder they tried to get it by borrowing it or by begging it here sir the money of the american people is acluilly taken in vast sums by the order of an executive officer without any authority whatever from congress and we are told that there is no cause of complaint because the seizure is not called an appi opriation but an interpretation why sir the levy of ship money was justified as a mere interpretation of an existing system and with much more plausibility than the pretense put forward to excuse this usurpation of authority i suppose gentlemen on both sides are aware that the ship money was in some respects a perfeptly lawfultax the right of the king to levy itin certain countieswasnever questioned it was his right to extend itor as our secretary of the interior would say to interpret itthatwas opposed and carried into the courts by hampden ever since the saxon monarchy ever since the danish invasion the maritime counties of england had been required to furnish the king with a ertain number of ships for the dfense of the coast under the norman and plantagenet kings this contribution of ships was changed to contributions of notey with which the king purchased ships and in addition to the vessbls obtained in this way he maintained a number of naval mercenaries at his own expense this was the beginning and foundation of the english nayy which has always been the main defense of tho aprl 9 i country and to support which extraordinary methods of taxatiob could be justified if they are ever capable of any justification after the parliament of 1629 had been dissolved by charles the first eleven years elapsed before its successor was summoned and during that period the king undertook to support his government by levying ship money his right to do which so far as the martim6 counties were concerned had never been questioned at least in time of war or danger of war and at that time there was reason to apprehend invasion by advice of the attorneygeneral the king undertook to extend the operation of this tax from the maritime counties to the whole island so as t6 increase the amount of the revenue while making the burden on each contributor smaller this extension of taxation by int6rpretation in the time of charles the first was justified upon grounds of very great plausibility and force it was argued that the defense of the kingdom did not concern the maritime counties alone but the whole country that while the footsteps of an invader would first press the soil along the coast if the invasion were successful the other counties would feel the burden of his exactions and for that reason the rest of the country should contribute to the common defense and by the same method of taxation anyone who reads the report of hampdens case in the state trials will appreciate the force of the argument and the weight of the precedent on which the court by a vote of 7 to 5 sustained the right of the king to levy ship money yet that decision provoked a resistance which shook the wholekingdom to its foundations the king succeeded in maintaining the tax before the judges but his success in the court of exchequer chamber cost him his head in the court of the high commission and as his head fell every attempt to tax the english people by executive authority fell with it the kingship was revived and exists today but all schemes for obtaining the property of the citizen by ship money benevolences or loans or any other device except the consent of parliament has been abandoned finally and forever shall the attempt to dispose of public moneys by executive authority be revived here shall the descendants and successors of the men who fled from england before the independence of parliament was established because they were so warmly attached to liberty that they would not remain on english soil while there was danger that despotism might be allowed to pollute it who established here institutions of freedom built on the principles which they cherished so deeply that they left their homes to be sure of enjoying them whose descendants wrote anew in their blood undying hostility to every attempt of executive officers to dispose of public moneys shall we permit the representative government which they established to be undermined shall we allow their sacrifices to be made fruitless their wisdom to be impdached their lives made useless by the pusillanimous failure of this congress to do its duty to itself and to the people it is charged to represent i repeat that to reestablish the dignity of this house no new powers are needed it is only necessary that the powers which it has should be vigilantly asserted and resolutely exercised here is where it seems to me the decline in the consequence of this house may be due to the very excellence of its members the senate in violati6n of plain constitutional provision as the gentleman from massachusetts points out has claimed the power to frame every line of a bill for raising money except the enactment clausethat is to say it claims the right to originate every revenue feature of a revenue measureand the house has submitted to this aggression so frequently that it has become a common feature of our legislative proceedings whenever a question has arisen between the house and the senate the house has given way because the members of this body have been so sensitive to the public welfare that they have preferred to sacrifice the privileges of the house rather than run any possible risk of disturbance to the business and order of the community by asserting them this i believe has been a calamitous sacrifice of duty notwithstanding the excellence of the motives that permitted it when the senate undertakes an aggression the house can not tolerate it without a betrayal of duty if the senate persist notwithstanding the protests of the house then i believe the house should appeal from the aggressions of the senate and the disputes of the conference room to the judgment of the electors the people should be asked to decide whether the constitutional privileges of the house are worth preserving if the judgment be adverse to the rights of the house its position will be no worse than if those rights be surrendered without a struggle if the judgment be favorable that one favorable verdict will reestablish the authority of this house so firmly that no man will again attempt to attack it either in the senate chamber in the executive mansion or in any of the executive departments during the last century every department of our government except this body has developed new powers yet every power new and old we can share if we be resolute in using the weapon which the constitutio offers us if that weapon be too formidable for these hands to wield then we may be sure it will be wielded against us such a formidable weapon cab not be available during a dispute without its being used by one side or the other if we do not jealously maintain control of the purse and exercise it to protect the powers of the house that control will be seized by other hands and used to reduce still further our importance i doubt sir if gentlemen on either side fully conceive the extent to which new powers have been developed by other departments under the actual operation of the constitution the senate and the executive have assumed power to change the limits of these united states without consulting us nd now they claim power to change the revenue laws governing the states not by the consent of this body but by the consent of foreign governments and foreign potentates sir our national existence is based on the principle that government without consent of the governed is tyranny inadmissible and indefensible in point of morals or ethics and are we now to be governedis this country to be governedin the important ihatter of raising revenue not by the consent of this house or of any other body representing the american people but by the consent of foreign kings and foreign ministers and foreign bodies there is no occasion for any such submission this house need not permit the slightest power to be exercised by the senate or by the senate and executive combined that may affect the substantial conditions of this country without its consent if it have but the nerve to assert its own authority in this i am not suggesting any new construction of the constitution but a restoration of the government to the condition contemplated by its framers and maintained by them while they still administered it the first and greatest expansion of our territorial limits was the acquisition of louisiana by mr jefferson before he undertook any negotiations for the purchase of that territory he sent down to this house a special message in which he asked for an appropriation of 3 000 000 nominally for the improvement of the diplomatic service of the united states but which the message explained would actually be used for the purchase of the island of orleans and the enactment by the house of that bill it was stated would be taken as the consent of congress to that enterprise when subsequently the whole territory of louisiana was acquired it was stated again and again that the treaty of purchase was subject to the action of this house whose approval or disapproval would be expressed by the adoption or rejection of the appropriation necessary to carry it into effect that power which jefferson acknowledged still belongs to this house it has been usurped by the executive and senate through the submission of this body it can be restored if we be patriotic enough to demand its restoration and resolute in enforcing the demand how is the right to be established i may be asked sir the answer is simple parliament never received any specific authority from anyone to make the king change his ministers whenever the commons expressed lack of confidence in them by an adverse vote but it established that authority by the simple expedient of saying to the sovereign if you choose ministers of whom we do not approve we will not give you any money to run your government that same power belongs to us by the same means we can establish our right to be consulted before any change can be made in our government or in the lands subject to it let us adopt a resolution here declaring to all the world that if any attempt be made to change the limits of the united states without the prior consent of this body we will consider that attempt sufficient reason for refusing an appropriation to carry it out let it be made clear by the unanimity of its adoption that no matter which party may be in control such a rule will be enforced and your right will be at once established for no foreign power will negotiate a treaty without first making sure that this house would consent to what the treaty proposed to accomplish if we are to reestablish our authority our first step must be to restore our confidence in ourselves it is a remarkable fact sir and i think it explains our decay that every rule which the house has adopted for the preservation of its dignity is not leveled against assault from outside but is directed against its own members where we express distrust of ourselves it is not surprising that other powers and bodies and officers view us with distrust and sometimes with contempt the english house of commons established all its power by making appropriations depend upon the redress of certain grievances or the establishment of certain laws which it desired by the constant exercise of this power the whole system of constitutional liberty was established it is amazing almost inconceivable that this powerthe one weapon which has proved effective for the establishment of parliamentary importancethis house has deliberately cast away by adopting a rule that no new legislation can be attached to appropriation bills again sir by ourrules no member can challenge the judgment of thie house on anything he can not even address a petition or offer a resolution from his place on the floor he must go around to a basket out of the notice of the house and drop his application his resolution or petition silently and secretly into a receptacle as though he were engaged in an act of doubtful propriety to be performed surreptitiously i am aware of course that all of these rules are justified on the ground that it is necessary to guard the house against abuse but sir is not this a confession of profound distrust in our own membership surely sir it must be clear that if we can not be trusted we ought to be abolished if our morals are so base our intelligence so limited our patriotism so feeble that we must establish rules to nullify the powers which the constitution confers upon us surely sir that is an argument for an amendment of the constitution looking to the complete elimination of our activities is it any wonder that a body whose members are so distrusted by themselves should be an object of contempt to others i never real ized myself the degree to which the contempt of the house is shared by its own members until i heard the speech delivered by the gentleman from ohio general grosvenor on the postoffice matter now i refer to this without the slightest desire to bring up the particular questions that were involved in the discussion of that department but merely to call attention to his statement for i think it illustrates the profound depths to which we have fallen since it did not provoke the slightest comment on either side of the house the gentleman from ohio addressing the gentleman from missouri challenged him to name or describe a single offense committed by any postal officer and declared that when proof was adduced that a crime had been committed this house will investigate it or act upon it now i am not making any play upon words i understood him to say that if a crime or offense were slhown to have been committed this house would then take action upon it some way or other now conceive what that means conceive what a renunciation on the part of the house it expresses what a total misconception of our functions it betrays what is this house primarily and above all in our constitutional system why sir first of all we are the grand inquest of this nation we are not here to sit in judgment on offenses that belongs to another bodybut to inquire whether offenses have been committed and if we discover any to formulate impeachments againt the officers who perpetrate them the power of appropriation which we possess charges us with the duty of supervision whenever we appropriate money we assert by constitutional implication that we are trusting it to hands that we know to be clean when therefore an official liable to impeachment by this house is prosecuted to judgment for corruption or malfeasance in any inferior court his conviction is our impeachment it is conclusive proof that we have neglected our duty of inquiry and supervision"], [0.9264717176556587, 0.07352828234434128, 1, "i do he says the proposals for changes may be classified as follows first alterations in the organization

unprovoked address in this house on what is commonly called the negro question a question touching the right of the negro to vote which seeims to be the legitimate bequest of the slavery discussion the resolutions referred to are as follows resolved that the government be requested to instruct the district attorneys in the various sttes where an illeat suppression of votes is alleged to prosecute every case where there has been a violation of the laws of the united states in reference to suffrage if adequate evidence can be obtained to justify a submission of such case to the grand jury reeolced 1 that cotigiess he requested anid be respectfully urged to investigate with thoroughness and impartiality the chatges of a suppression of votes contrary to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendmnetits to thea constitutioni of the uiiited stales and in every case where such restriction is accomplished by a limitatioti of the franchise for any reason the representation of such state to congress he reduced and also to see that the fifteenth amendment be in no way violated either directly or by subterfuge and 2 that where the decisions of the courts or thepractices at electionis disclose the fact that the statutes are inadequate amendatory act be passed remedying the defects disclosed in the outset i wish to congratulate the democracy upon having at last found a champion to voice boldly and unflinchingly the sentiments which the party has long cherished but has not had the hardihood to proclaim the gentleman from georgia states them courageously and for that i honor him i have waited for those older and abler than myselfto make some reply but so far in vain i feel thsat if the time has arrived which is suggested by the remarks of the gentleman from georgia for a discussionof the socalled negro question it should be on the lines of cooperation between all the states of the union north and south east and west uniting in an earnest desire to solve if possible this great problema problem which ought not to any longer separate northern feeling from southern feeling as it is one concerning which all states and all sections should strive as in all other great national questions for a wise solution always however within the limits of the constitution which both north and south east and west equally claim and jealously guard in the gentlemans argument he has quoted with a great deal of satisfaction to hinself from perhaps the ablest of american statesmen claiming the political faith of the republican partythe hon james g blamne the very conclusions which he has arrived at and which he desires the house to accept by the resolutions which he and others have introduced were presented some years ago for argument and discussion under the heading of ought the negro to be disfranchised ought he to have been enfranchised this discussion was engaged in by eight gentlemenone the hon james g blamne who as i have said has been so often quoted by the gentleman from georgia the others with the exception of general garfield and mr wendell phillips were gentlemen identified with the democratic party and distinguished and influential in its councils at that time general garfield was a republican afterwards president of the united states and one who had taken an honorable and prominent part in all legislation respecting negro suffrage mr wendell phillips was neither a republican nor a democrat but always reserved to himself the right to criticise and condemn either party the other gentlemen who engaged in this discussion were the hon l q c lamar united states senator from m ississippi wade hampton governor of south carolina alexander h stephens representative from georgia montgomery blair a member of the cabinet of president lincoln and thomas a hendricks united states senator from indiana and subsequently vicepresident of the united states in the first cleveland administration in the concluding article mr blamne says of the replies made by the other gentletoen identified as they have been and are with the democratic party it is noteworthy that with the exception of mr blair they agree that the negro ought ndt to be diafranchished as adl of these aentlamen were hostile to the enfranchisetnent of the race their present position must be taken as a step forward and as an attestation of the wisdom and courage of tme republican party at the time they were violently opposing its measures this general expression leaves mrt blair to he tieated as an exception and for many of his averments the best answer is to be found in the suggestions and concessions of his democratic associates i need not make any elaborate reply to mr blair when he is answered with such significance and such point by those of his own political household it is one of the curious developments of political history that a man who sat in the cabinet of abraham lincoln and was present when emancipation was decreed should live to write a paper against the enfranchisement of the negro when the vicepresident of the rebel confederacyand two of its most distinguished officers are taking the other side it will be noticed that in the argument of mr blaine he does not suppose possible the existence of conditions that confront us today he says the class of men whose views are thus hastily summarized do not contemplate the withdrawal of the suffrage from the negro without a corresponding reduction in therepresentation in congress of the states where the negro is a large factor in the apportionment and yet it is quite probable that they have not given thought to the difficulty or rather the impossibility of compassing that end under the constitution as it is now construed the diminution of representative strength could only result from the states passing such laws as would disfranchise the negro by some educational or property test as it is forbidden by the fifteenth amendment to disfranchise him on acount of his race but no southern state will do this and for two reasons first they will in no event consent to a reduction of representative strength and second they could not make any disfranchisement of the negro that would not at the same time disfranchise an immense number of whites and yet the very thing has happened which mr blaine in all his faith and reliance in the power and justice of the republican party in meeting the issues believed would at once be corrected and what he also did not believe that the democratic party of the south would attempt fearing a reduction in representation which is emphasized by the resolutions of the gentleman from georgia further on he says no human right on this continent is more completely guaranteed than the right against disfranchisement on account of race color or previous ondition of servitude as embodied in the fifteenth amendmentof the constitution of the united states in the argument advanced by hon alexander h stephens to demonstrate the purity of the enactment of the laws of his state he laid great stress upon a decision which had just then been rendered by judge snead in which attention was called to the political debauchery and the purchasable character of the negro vote now let me read from some newspapers published within the last two years in a certain county in the state which mr stephens had the honor to represent showing how now that the negro has been disqualified the purity of the ballot has been assured eliminating the negro vote made a great stride forward in politics some men in considering the expensiveness of the white purchasable vote declare the white primary is a failure but this is ht superficial view negro voters may have been cheaper but we paid a great deal more than money for them we gave a prominence to worthless negro vagabonds and white ward workers were compelled for nights in advance of the election to be corralled with negroes in bullpens in doling out cigars and whisky serving barbecues and permitting familiarities in speech and action from insolent blacks who took advantage of the need for their votes to push themselves into social equality the elimination of the negro vote has retired the negro bully and blackguard from the election precinct and we are also freed from the sight of noisy aiid halfdrunken negroes being driveii in carriages from polls to polls to vote first in one name and then another for this much let us give thanks sbut we have developed a new era many white men who would not sell their votes underthe old rdgime along with the negroes now barter them in the most brazen manner and it is declared we now have nearly 2 000 purchasable white voters the elimination of this evil is the next thing to which the citizens must address themselves there must be a sentiment created in the community against buying votes as well as to cotidemn the sellers one is as reprhensible as the other and the former is largely responsible for the latter the best men in the community must devote themselves to the solution of this problem the disease has grown to desperate proportios there is no common sense and no morals in a candidate having to buy his way into office or in an official having to spend two or three years salary to retain his office this is a political blot on the county that must be wiped out let the heat thought in the community be devoted to devising a practical remedy in eliminating the negro we have taken a valuable step now let us take another and eliminate the possibility to 2 000 purchasable white voters being the balance of power in all our elections there are a great many more dollars in circulation today than there were yesterday tendollar hills fivedollar hills but no small change were strictly in evidence at every

used in order that myembers of the house may have an opportunity of studying and comparing the views and conclusions of men who had taken the most prominent parts in bringing about a condition that they were at that time discussing whose judgments and decisions were made after careful deliberation as to what might or what might niot be the effect of a misstatement i shall print as part of my remarks the arguments of these distinguished gentlemen these articles to which i refer were written some twentyfive years ago it is therefore necessary to ask ourselves what the causes are if any which have brought about the necessity which is evidenced by the resolutions introduced by the gentleman from georgia and the conclusions reached by him in his arguments by the introduction of his resolutions for the repeal of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments the gentleman from georgia admits the necessity of some action by congress concerning these particular parts of the constitution the question at once arises what is this necessity and what would be the effect if these amendments were not repealed no other answer can be made except that their provisions are in danger of being enforced by congress what provision in these amendments is to be feared by the representatives from certain southern states who have introduced these resolutions surely not that which provides that the right of suffrage shill not be denied on account of race color or previous condition of servitude for the manner in which these stzt s have brought about the abridgment of the suffrage has bepn twice dscided by the supreme court of the united states to be matters for state regulation the only conclusion therefore which can be arrived at for the necessity for the repeal of the amendment referred to in the resolutions is the fear that the rovisions which require that representation in congress shall e reduced accordingly might be enforced i shall not follow the gentleman in his zigzag journey through the last half century of american history but shall admit as riot at all relevant or important to this discussion the most of his historical citations i shall frankly admit that most of the northern states have at one time or another refused the baeot to he negro and that there are only three or four states in the union where the suffrage has always been extended to the negro in several northern states indeed voting is still prohibited to the negro by their organic law though in effect this law is now overridd n and nullified by the fifteenth amendment i also concede that a 3hajority of the stateinen of the north before the rebellion were not in favor of interfering with slavery in the south or of extending negro suffrage in the north many of the most conspicuous fearless and effective abolitionists that this country ever saw men in favor of universal emancipation and effecting it whenever they could regarding slavery as an unmixed evil a curse to white and black alike and to be abolished at the earliest practicable moment were southern men i need not mention suchnamesas washington jefferson richard henry lee grimke birney cassius m clay and if we could call the roll a thousand brave and generous souls would answer nor shall i claim mr lincoln as an original antislavery man when he was elected president he seemed to have been almost indifferent to the existence of slavery and declared that he was willing to preserve the union half slave and half free he had no ihtention of meddling with slavery in the states where it existed and did not wish to give the ballot to the negroes even in his own state he wanted to save the union nothing else was of any consequence on these questions his views and purposes were shared by almost all the members of the party which elected him many millions of our people assume without thinking that negro suffrage was forced upon the south by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments as an act of hostility and in a spirit of revenge the exact opposite is true these amendments were added to the constitution in the interest of harmony and for the purpose of perfecting the real purpose of the thirteenth amendment here is the state of things slavery had been abolished the whites of the south could not conceive of the possibility that the free negro would work without physical compulsion when it became known that president johnsons purpose was to allow the states lately in rebellion to resume their former relations to the union with full control of their own affairs the whites perceived that by municipal laws they could reduce the black race to semislavery which would keep it industrially and politically in the power of the former masters several of the southern states adopted legislative statutes and civic ordinances for the purpose of carrying out this policy and realizing this reestablished relation of servitude louisiana adopted these ordinances every negro is required to be in the regular service of some white person or former owner who shall be responsible for the conduct of said negro but said employer or former owner may permit said negro to hire his own time by special permission in writing which permit shall not extend over seven days at one time no negro shall sell barter or exchange any article of merchandise without the special written permission of his employer regulations were also adopted compelling negroes under penalty to be in their quarters at certain hours and others defining the times places and methods of their buying and selling this of course established a peonage scarcely less dear than the slavery from which they had escaped it made their emancipation a mockery it abolished free labor it reestablished the overseer system if these laws continued to exist slavery was not abolished mr lincoln has been quoted as saying that he was not in sympathy with giving the right of franchise to the negro let me ask if it is imagined that had mr lincoln lived and realized that practically the only condition which was imposed by the victors of that most terrible of all terrible strugglesnamely the adoption in spirit as well as in fact of the thirteenth amendmentwas not being carried out and therefore the chief result of the war nullified would he not have sanctioned and put into force the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments with all that dogged earnestness of purpose with which he waged the war for the preservation of the union even though it cost him as much or even more sorrow in this situation two alternatives presented themselvesindefinite or prolonged military rule by the federal army in the southern states or the endowment of the black race with enough political power to insure their protection in this dilemma the ablest and most distinguished men in both houses of congress were gathered about president johnson including general grant his successor and an earnest and prolonged conference was held after much discussion it was decided that permanent military rule was too obnoxious to be seriously considered and that remedy was rejected the majority of the republican party did not consider the enfranchisement of the negro anideal solution of the vexing problem but it seemed the best at hand and was adopted as a great improvement upon anarchy if the army rule had been continued with a regiment of federal soldiers in every state military rule would undoubtedly have produced as it always does produce enormous and terrible evils one of the ablest statesmen of that time carl schurz traveled through the south soon after the close of the war as the personal agent of president andrew johnson to study the conditions which reconstruction had to face he says it ii not to be forgotten that negro enfranchisement was resorted to in a situation so complicated that whatever might have been done to solve the most pressing problems would have appeared a colossal mistake in the light of subsequent developments on july 28 1868 the secretary of state in pursuance of a concurrent resolhtion of congress passed one week previously issued a proclamation declaring that the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by threefourths of the states and on the 30th day of march 1870 he issued a similar proclamation declaring that the fifteenth amendment had been duly ratified by threefourths of the states the supreme court has decided a great number of cases arising under both these amendments as may be seen by reference to the constitution manual and digest prepared for the fiftyeighth congress the validity of the amendments has been sustained in every one of these cases it is now too late to question their validity or disobey their mandates indeed i do not think their validity was ever questioned in this house until the 27th of january 1904 when the gentleman from georgia consented to illuminate the subject it is attempted to apologize for the violation by some of the southern states of these amendments or at least to minimize their offense against human rights by asserting that some northern states as ohio kansas and minnesota rejected negro suffrage for themselves during the very year that the fifteenth amendment was adopted and that no state in the union except new york had ever explicitly extended to the negro the right to vote this is indeed true but it is to be added that since the adoption of the fifteenth amendment they have never denied to him the right to vote on account of color notwithstanding the immense majority in congress and of states by which these amendments were ratified the gentleman from georgia has the assurance to say the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments were adopted if adopted at all against the will of a majority of all the people in the union by trickery and treachery in the north and by force and violence in the south he announces that awful things will happen if the united states shall have the temerity to attempt to enforce these amendments it will cause a cyclone a hurricane possibly an earthquake the fourteenth amendment provides that when the right to vote for president representatives in congress or state officers is denied to citizens of the united states except for participation in rebellion or other crimes the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens bears to the whole number of male citizens 21 years of age in said state and here the gentleman from georgia raises his voice and exclaims if congress should be unwise enough to elect to exercise the discretionary power vested in it by section 5 of article xiv it will not only be the most serious strain of the present cordial relations so happily existing between the sections but it will require a readjustment of the basis of representation that will not start at the potomac and at rio grande but will stretch from hatteras to the golden gate from maine to florida and will embrace in its majestic sweep every state and territory in the union and even our new islands of the sea by this comprehensive menace the gentleman from geoigia means that under section 2 article xiv it is prescribed that when the right to vote is denied to any of the male inhabitants of any state who are 21 years of age and citizens of the united states or in any way abridged except for participation in rebellion or for bther crimes the basis of representation in that state shall be reduced accordingly i admit the contention that is what it means he further claims that several of the northern states do in fact at the present time abridge the franchise of citizens of the united states who are 21 years old by requiring educational or property qualificttions or prepayment of taxes or a specific religious belief or nativity in the united states or the use of the australian ballot requiring a certain degree of intelligence and lie insists that the basis of representation shall be reduced accordingly in said states i shall not enter upon that discussion it is a question for the federal courts if after due consideration they shall deliberately decide and declare that such limitations of the franchise do in fact come within the purport of that amendment the people of the states which for the promotion of the public welfare have placed such limitations upon the franchise will accept the decision without a murmur and modify their basis of apportionment according thereto of the 9 000 000 socalled negroes in the united states 8 000 000 are in the fifteen southern states of males 21 years of age the negroes number about 2 000 000 in this nation the gentleman from georgia alleges that of the more than a million and a half negro males of voting age in the eleven states that once constituted the southern confederacy threefourths of a million can neither read nor write i would ask him if he is proud of this record if he experiences selfsatisfaction in the reflection and the declaration that a majority of the negroes of the south can neither read nor write he says that the illiteracy of the southern negro has been rapidly reduced since he was made free that negro illiteracy in those states was 77 per cent in 1880 63 per cent in 1890 and 49 per cent in 1900in other words that more than onehalf the negroes of the south can now read and write and that the number who can read and write today is 50 per cent greater than it was when lincoln issued his emancipation proclamation this would seem to be a marvelously good showing but it is argued otherwise it is insisted that while the southern negro is more intelligent he is more wicked and pernicious or in the language of the gentleman during this same period his criminality increased in more rapid ratio than his illiteracy decreased this he tries to prove by adducing the alleged fact that the number of negroes arrested in the south has increased onethird during the last twenty years on arriving at this datum my friend exclams there you are there are more prisoners than there used to be ergo more crime he seems to think that settles the question i want to ask does it settle the question let us see in old slavery times there were very few negroes arrested in the entire south if a negro went bad lie was flogged or subjected to some physical remonstrance which he appreciated and which was continued until he went good again so there were almost no arrests after the war the negroes became subject to the statute law but the planter was still to some extent the patriarch and had his own methods of restraining the vicious and lawless when the ballot was given to the negro by the fifteenth amendment and the reconstruction measures were enforced it caused tremendous irritation and exasperation between the races the bitter hostilities then engendered sfill exist and i might suggest have something to do with the increase in the number of negro prisoners while it is undeniably the right of each state to care for its criminal population as it deems most advisable yet i venture the opinion that if the various jails and penitentiaries in some of the southern states were conducted in a manner which would not bring the inmates into social contact with one another so that ore imprisoned for a trifling offense would not be brought in contant and contaminated by the habitual or confirmed criminal and if such institutions were conducted at an expense to the state rather than at a substantial profit it is but reasonable to suppose that crime in thg south would show a marked decrease professor kellar of the university of chicago in a sociological study of the criminal negro in the arena january 1901 says before the war the south had but few penal institutions the criminal then as now was the negro and as a slave he was chastised or dispatched by his master as the nature of his crime demanded the few whites were confined in jails or county prisons the previous condition of the negro as a slave makes the progress of the reformatory idea exceedingly slow for it must grow with the conception of the negro as a man the current opinion in the south is t he negro is incapable of reform in alabama and georgia county reformatories are being established and new orleans is struggling to obtain one ia those alseady existing much labor and little instruction are the practice most of the advancement seen in northern penal systems and laws is unknown manny of the people are hostile to the reformatory idea for the basis of the southern system i financial a successful prison administration is judged by the amount of net revenue in the state there are no southern organizations for the study of criminality and no state bureaus of charity in fact one state often does not know the systems of its neighbor these conditions are fatal to the application of any scientific masures and preclude the study of the causes of crime so long as a states cr minals bring it a net revenue of from 30 000 to 150 000 a year it is difficult to introduce methods leading to reform and to decrease of crime let me ask what is bringing about this ratio of increase in clime first to my mind it is the methods employed in the punishment of crime second the dawning realization that the white man intends by indirection to annul the civil rights guaranteed the negro by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments third the cruel limitation realized by the colored man who has been educated or who has educated himself when he realizes that notwithstanding his intellectual qualities no matter how great or how superior to those of his neighbors his color compels him forever to herd with the lowest of his people is it fair through education and the consequent knowlege of the rights guaranteed under the constitution as it stands today to raise up and give the colored man like the children of israel a glimpse of the promised land civil rightsonly to drag him back into a position of hopelessness if the negroes are going back as a result of education so are we what example may i ask do we give of civilized methods as the result of over two thousand years of education and consequent supposed refinement we institute the stockade principle where a man is worse than a slave we prevent him by intimidation from exercising the civil rights which we know belong to him under the instrument which made us what we are when a crime is committed we follow him like a wild beast with dogs when captured we burn him alive like the indians did their captives during the early days of this country and at the same time we are admitting the indians to citizenship professor kellor in an article on the criminal negro says the statement is often seen that crime has increased among the negroes since the war that is a matter of no surprise because increased freedom of an ignorant people invariably means increased violations of law inthe second place acts sanctioned in slavery as adultery and small thefts were not then considered as crimes third there were no records keptbefore tho war so no closecomparisons are possible fourth since the freeing of the negro penalties for certain crimes have been increased there are no agencies in the south for reforming criminals and wayward children are not protected as in the north f or these reasons increase of crime does not mean deterioration of the race but it is one phase of its attempt to meet new conditions and external forces in the north crime is increasing among the negroes but there also they are meeting a most complex and advanced civilization for which they have but a slight preparation a more exhaustive study of criniinalty carried out along lines some of which have been indicated in the preceding articles would tendto lead to conclusions having this import 1 climate soil food and economic and social conditions are essential elements in any study of criminality and by social conditions are meant all environmental factors until thes3 influences are estimated and measures are based upon the recognition of them no great reduction in the amount of crime can be anticipatec with reference to these the negro is more disadvantageously placed than is any other class in america 2 the laws and penal institutions in the south are not conducted with a view to decreasing crime but to care for the prisoner and secure revenue preventive measures especially with reference to children are just finding a place experience has shown that the institutional system is of great importanco in both prevention and reformation 3 the measurements and tests made upon a limited number do notreveal physical and mental conditions that should discourage efforts in education anl development 4 the environments in the south are favorable to the commission of crime byenegroes it is impossible to estimate the persistency of racial traits or of elimitations mental or physical imposed by racial development until a parallel environment is removed that is the environment must be shown to be of such a nature that it offers every opportunity for development and improvement in no phase of negroes life domestic social industrial political or religious does this appear to be the case even if as it is assumed crime has increased among the negroes why should education be blamed for this surely this is an unfair conclusion i think everyone will admit that education has been of benefit to a great many negroes if on the other hand some have not profited by the education that they have received is it fair that we should say that the education of the negro is a mistake and deprive all negroes of education on the 12th of last february at a meeting in new york the question of negro industrial education and its bearing on the race problem was discussed andrew carnegie presided president eliot of harvard was among the speakers expresident grover cleveland who has some standing in this country though he is not believed in by the latterday democracy sent a letter in which he said i am so completely convinced of the importance of this cause as it is related to the solution of a problem no patriotic citizen should neglect that i look upon every attempt to stimulate popular interest and activity in its behalf as a duty of citizenship booker t washington whom the gentleman from georgia would disfranchise because of his color was the leading speaker at this convocatipn of great men i quote from his speech a few paragraphs which were not but might have been spoken in reply to the gentleman from georgia after making careful inquiry i can not find a half a dozen cases of a man or woman who has completed a full course of education in any of our repuapri 4 table institutions like hampton tuskegee fiske or atlanta who are inprisoned the records of the south show that 90 per centof the colored people imprisoned are without knowledge of trades and 61 per cent are illiterate but it has been said that the negro proves economically valueless in proportion as he is educated let us see all will agree that the negro in virginia for example began life forty years ago in complete poverty scarcely owning clothing or a days food the reports of the state auditor show the negro today owns at least one twentysixth of the real estate in that commonwealth exciusive of his holdingsin towns and cities and that in the counties east of the blue ridge mountains he owns onesixteenth in middlesex county he owns onesixth in hanover onefourth in georgia the official records show that largely through the influence of educated men and women from atlautaschoolsand others the negrees added last year l 526 003 totheir taxable property making the total amount upon which they pay taxes in that state alone 16 700 000 few people realize under the most difficult and trying circumstances during the last forty years it has been the educated negro who counseled patience selfcontrol and thus averted a war of races every negro going out of our institutions properly educated becomes a link in the chain that shall forever bind the two races together in all essentials of life thomas nelson page who has made a deep study of the negro problem says it is from the educated negro that is the negro who is more enlightened than the general body of his race that order must come the ignorance venality and superstition of the average negro are dangerous to us education will divide them and uplift them if it is true that as a distinguished southern statesman has remarked a smart nigger is a bad nigger we must change all our opinions of the value of an education for such a conclusion would involve whites as deeply as blacks if education tends to depravity debauchery and an increase of criminality then we have too many schools too many colleges too many books too many newspapers and for that matter too many educated members of congress it is not alone in the southern states that the negro is unfairly treated in the enforcement of law it is also true that in the northern states courts and juries are often his enemies always ready to exaggerate his faults and ignore his virtues the negro especially the ambitious and aspiring negro is treated very much as the jew is treated by the ignorant peasantry of russia everywhere prejudice tracks him and defeats him everywhere he is more or less looked upon as necessarily an inferior and is discriminated against in many of the walks of life the rev edgar g murphy secretary of the southern society which holds a conference on race problems at montgomery ala in may in a recent address delivered in philadelphia said the general problem of the negros legal rights his rights before the southern jury and before the average court presents our subject however under one of its darkest aspects it is hard for the negro to get justice the evil is not easy of remedy but southern men are working upon it and southern men themselves will right it in so far as it can be righted i need hardly tell you that this evil is not peculiar to the south as prof w f wilcox of cornell chief statistician in the census office and a northern man has indicated in a recent paper upon negro criminality there are more convictions of neeroes for crime at the north in proportion to the number of the negro population than at the south the result is due i think not only to the negros weaknesses but to the popular prejudice everywhere against an inferior race a short time ago a distinguished statesman of the other house declared that there was more crime in new england in proportion to the population than in his own state and he proved it to his satisfaction by showing that there were more jails and state v risons in the same way doubtless he would prove that new ork furnishes a larger proportion of lunatics than his own state because it builds more lunatic asylums in the same way he would prove that the people of massachusetts are more illiterate than the people of georgia by showing that the people of massachusetts had the most schoolhouses i am not one of those who believe that the negro race any more than any other race can be taken up bodily as it were and put upon a plane of high civilization and usefulness it must depend absolutely upon the individual negro as it depends upon the individual anglosaxon or those of other extraction as to whether they will rise and become capable of assuming a place in the affairs of men rather than remain in oblivion governor vardaman of mississippi made a crusade through the north in opposition to negro education here is a choice sample of his refined classic style i am opposed to the niggers voting it matters not what his advertised moral and mental qualifications may be i am just as much opposed to booker washington with all his anglosaxon reenforcement voting as i am to voting by the cocoanutheaded chocolatecolored typical little coon andy dotson who blacks my shoes every morning neither one is fit to perform the supreme functions of citizenship while i admire the ability lately shown by the distinguished governor to uphold the majesty of the law in his state yet i might suggest that this elegant quotation does not demonstrate a vast superiority over the gentleman referred to in the quotation the same distinguished governor however is at least consistent for having conducted his campaign upon the platform of ceasing to educate the negro he has during the past few days vetoed a bill carrying an appropriation for a negroschool we have here what might be likened to a very elementary problem a certain state does not disfranchise the negro on account 6f his color but simply imposes an educational test which of course requires that for a negro to vote he shall have the necessary education to obtain this education he must go to school suppose that all the bills carrying the negroschool appropriations are vetoed then we have no school funds therefore no schools no opportunity for learning therefore illiteracy or quod erat deinonzstrandundisfranchisement if i were a southerner born and bred and felt toward the negro as governor vardaman and the gentleman from georgia feel i would he in favor of sacrificing some of the representation of my state in congress to achieve my purpose honestly i would agree with governor hampton when he said that to get the negro out of politics he would gladly give up the representation based on his vote a question has been raised as to a possible social equality between the white and the black races in answer to that i can not do better than quote from the best exponent of the best thought and education among the negro race in this country booker t washington who says in all things social as separate as the fingers yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress to begin with social equality no more exists in this country either in the north or the south among whites than it does in any other country the man himself or the woman herself is the judge of his or her equal social equality has nothing whatever to do with civil rights it is a thing separate and apart and therefore nothing to do with this question the corner stone upon which the democratic institutions of this country are founded the hope of all americans whether they be native born or naturalized white or black is based and exemplified in the general principle enunciated by president roosevelt when he declared i do not intend to appoint any unfit man to office so far as i legitimately can i shall always endeavor to pay regard to the wishes and feelings of the people of each locality but i can not consent to take the position that the deor of hope the door of opportunity is to be shut upon any man no matter how worthy purely upon the grounts of race or color such an attitude would according to my convictions be fundamentally wrong and he then proceeds if as you hold the great bulk of the colored people are not yet fit in point of character and influence to hold sueh positions it seems to me that it is worth while putting a premium upon the effort among them to achieve the character and standing which will fit them no fairminded man can help but admire the frankness of the president when he asserts in no uncertain language that it is a good thing to make the negro realize that if he shows in marked degree the qualities of good citizenship he can look forward to and hope for recognition again i say if the statistics quoted by the gentleman are correct then there must be as much radically wrong with the method of education employed as there is with the opporttmities given them of exercising the rights guaranteed to them under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments personally i do not believe in higher education for whites or blacks except where exceptional cases are found i think that the three rs reading riting and rithmetic as the old schoolmaster used to say together with geography united states history and a good manual training would make us a stronger nation instead of the compulsory military service in vogue in european powers i should like to see tried a compulsory trade service i heartily agree with professor shaler that it is not to be denied that the task of developing the latent powers of the negro race which in his opinion are far greater than is generally believed is very serious he says it means a certain amount of technical education of a very great number of the children of ten million people yet this need not affright us for we may be sure that this like all other welldirected education will be a very good investment of public money for it will bear fruit in money as well as other values ever black man otherwise to be a mere plodding laborer who by such training is lifted to the grade of a skilled artisan will have his value to the state increased several old his annual earnings as a field hand will not exceed 3150 as a skilled blacksmith carpenter or machinist they should be at least 400 and in something like this measure his value will be advanced by his training the negro must not imagine that simply because he is a negro those who would befriend him among the whites will step in and protect him if he commits a crime on the other hand the whites must not impose unjust restrictions unjust laws and unjust sentences upon the negro simply because he is a negro to do so is undemocratic unamerican and in direct opposition to the principles upon which this government was founded and opposed to the welcome which we have extended to the oppressed of all nations in the struggle which faces their race negroes should regard any one of their color who commits a crime not only an offender against the law but an enemy of his own people and instead of ranging themselves on the side of the offender do all in their power to aid justice to lessen the steady growth of lynching which has so increased in frequency as to be appalling to the farsighted soberthinking members of the community i would suggest that the remedy advocated by justice brewer of the supreme court of the united states of doing away with the right of appeal in criminal cases be at once adopted by all the states the distinguished justice says what can be done to stay this epidemic of lynching one thing is the establishient of a greater confidence in the summary and certain punishment of the criminal men are afraid of laws delays and the uncertainty of its results not that they doubt the integrity of the judges but they know that the law abounds with technical rules and that appellate courts will often reverse a udgnent of conviction for a disregard of such rules notwithstanding a full belief in the guilt of the accused if all were certain that the guilty ones woul be promptly tried d punished the inducement to lynch would be largely taken away in an address wlich i delivered before the american bar association at detroit some years since i advocated doing away with appeals in criminal cases it did not meet the favor of the association but i still believe in its wisdom for nearly a hundred years there was no appeal from the judgment of conviction of criminal cases in our federal courts and no review except in a few cases in which two judges sitting a conference of opinion on a question of law was certified to the supreme dourt in england the rule has been that there was no appeal in criminal cases although a question of doubt might be reserved by the presiding judge for the consideration of his brethren e j phelps who was minister to england during m r clevelands first administration once told nm that while he was there only two cases were so reserved does anyone doubt that justice was f ally administered by the english courts it is said in extenuation of lynching in case of rape that it is an additional cruelty to the unfortunate victim to compel her to go upon the witness stand and in the presence of a mixed audience tell the story of her wrongs especially when she may be subject to cross examination by an overzealous counsel i do not belittle this matter but it must be remenbered that often the unfortunate victim never lives to tell the story of her wrongs and if she does survive she must tell it to some and the whole community knows the fact even in the court room any highminded judge will stay counsel from any unnecessary crossexamination and finally if any lawyer should attempt it the community may treat him as an outcast i can ut think that if the community felt that the criminal would certainly receive the punishment he deserves and receive it soon the eagerness for lynching would disappear and mobs whose gatherings too olten mean not nerely the destruction of jails and other property but also the loss of innocent lives would greatly diminish in number one thing is certain the tendency to lyching is to undermine the respect for the law and unless it be checked we need not be astonished if it be resorted to for all kinds of offenses and oftentimes innocent men suffer for wrongs committed by others our duty toward the negro race would seem to me to he one of encouragement and protectionencouraging those who having made the effort have achieved success in spite of the difficulties under which they necessarily labored owing to the natural limitations of a race scarcely three hundred years from savagery protecting those who having less ability are not given an opportunity or perhaps are not as fortunate as their fellows we should not forget that it was through the labor of these people that many of what were the richest states in this country were raised from their original primeval wilderness and madeto blossom like a rose the negro race on its side should realize what has been done for itno matter what its sufferings during slaveryin having received in less than three handred years a civilization which it has taken other races ages to acquire the race must realize its own weaknesses and its own shortcomings consequent upon the comparatively few years which it has enjoyed civilization itmust realize that the whites are as necessary to the negro race as the negro race in certain states is necessary to the white the negroes should not imagine and harbor fancied wrongs and those among them who aro gifted with good sense and sober judgment should exercise their best efforts to wipe out such a spirit and articularly in success set an example of modest conservative ehavior the negro race should also remember that the war which made them free caused untold suffering and in some cases made poor those to whom although they were their slaves they owe the civilization which they now possess compare the colored people whom it is quietly proposed to disfranchise with certain classes of foreigners who come to our shores ignorant of our laws ignorant of our language ignorant of our institutions who are eagerly naturalized sometimes even before the legal qualifications have been quasi conformed to let me refer the house to a carefully prepared list of the property interests of those affected by the amendments the gentleman would annul which i shall print and in this connection let me suggest another thought by repealing the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments at once all the negroes in the united states would be disfranchised of a t the present time in the united states according to the census of 1900 18 per cent are owned or operated by negro farmers and according to mr talcott williams editor of the philadelphia press the amount of property now owned by the negroes in this country amounts to almost 500 000 000 now by the resolutions introduced by the gentleman from georgia and others it is proposed to disfranchise all the owners of this property i would like to ask a were the causes which led up to the declaration of independence what it was that our forefathers fought for during 1776 let me suggest that the initial cause for which we fought was that there should be no taxation without representation and there can be no representation without the right to exercise the franchise direct representation of those governed in the governing body is the keystone of our democratic institutions if our government is not a representative government it is nothing i can not agree with those who advance the argument that the south should be left to solve the negro problem for the reason that when states enact legislation affecting the political status of large numbers of its citizens of voting age the result of such legislation is national in its effect and therefore must at once become the object of concern to all sections of the country one word in regard to the fourteenth amendment in the fourteenth amendment the very use of the word shall in prescribing the results to happen when certain conditions arose leaves no discretion to congress it is absolutely mandatory upon congress to take the course prescribed it has been urged that some northern states have restrictions on the suffrage the object of the crumpacker resolution is to have a full and fair investigation of the election laws of all the states for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent manhood citizenship has been disfranchised if the result of the investigation should be such as to justify it the purpose is to urge a reduction of the representation of the disfranchising states in accordance with the requirements of the constitution if after this investigation it is discovered that these other states restrict the franchise contrary to the constitution then their representation would have to be reduced accordingly why this dread of such an investigation if what is urged is true the northern states may be as seriously affected as the southern states i have not heard a protest against such an investigation from the gentleman from connecticut for instance or from the gentleman from ohio or from members of the pennsylvania delegation in the beginning of my remarks i said that i would endeavor to find if any existed the reasons why what was declared in 1879 by the leaders of both parties best qualified to judge ought to have been done and ought to be maintained in relation to the franchise should now be changed after this review of the subject the only reason which i can find for the introduction of the resolutions of my friend from georgia is that certain states have done through legislative enactment that which the statesmen of the days of 79 did not in their wildest dreams imagine would be done and that they now dread the results which the statesmen of both parties of those days declared would inevitably follownamely reduction of representation i feel that this is not a party question but one which concerns the integrity of the constitution itself it has been suggested that the state of pennsylvania like some others of the northern states imposes restrictions upon the franchise i for one do not propose to remain silent and inactive under the imputation which must necessarily follow that the pennsylvania delegation ought to be reduced and that some of the delegation as it now stands are occupying seats in this chamber contrary to the dhect mandates of the constitution of the united states as i remember the gentlemen representing their several states like myself on the 9th day of november when the name of the state which they represented was called left their seats went down and ranged themselves before the bar of the house raised their right hand and gave solemn audible assent to the oath of office which was read by the distinguished speaker of the house surely gentlemen we all realize the sacred character of an oath surely we realize that when with uplifted hand we call upon god to witness we intended to convey that we subscribe absolutely and entirely to what we swear to however we either failed to appreciate the solemnity of the oath and all it contained or else we must have satisfied our consciences by making a mental reservation in regard to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of that constitution which we swore to uphold otherwise the resolutions introduced by several of the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber and the necessity for which has been so eloquently defended by the gentleman from georgia would not be necessary by the introduction of these various resolutions for the repeal of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments we are asked to wipe out that part of the constitution which cost the country in life suffering and treasure a thousandfold more than was suffered by those who framed and fought for the original instrument according to an official estimate which i have just received from the record and pension office 2 200 000 northern and southern men were enlisted in all the different branches of the service during the civil wara number almost incredible when we stop for a moment to think about it of these 359 200 adtually died in the fieldan army almost double the size of that at present sent to the front by japan and larger by 50 000 than the army i with which the czar of russia expects to crush the power of the mikado the struggle which these vast armies of men engaged in for four long years resulted in what the very changes in the constitution which together with the thirteenth amendment it is now quietly proposed to annul would not we as legislators both those on this side of the chamber and those on the other partiularly the gentlemen who gave their personal services during that great struggle find ourselves in the position of the young napoleon

000 men to the front and would not those from south carolina who sent almost an equal number would not the representatives from new york who sent almost 450 000 would not the representatives from ohio
