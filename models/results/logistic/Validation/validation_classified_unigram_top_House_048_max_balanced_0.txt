done by t he courtmartial that the courtmartial was a tribunal having jurisdiction over this cause and that its decision of the cause is final binding upon the country binding upon congress without entering into a discussion of that proposition at length i plant myself simply upon the principle that congress can undo anything it has done unless the undoing of it shall violate some prohibition of the constitution for instance if congress enacts a law and contracts are made uder or by reason of that law congress can not revoke the law so ihr as it applies to those contracts because there is a prohibition in the constitution against any legislation impairing the obligation of contracts but congress may make a law defining a crime and may the next day repeal that law the repeal of the law obliterates the crime it stops the punishment imposed under the law in the case of fitzjohn porter this bill if it becomes a law will relieve him from the conviction and sentence of the courtmartial and restore him to the position he would now hold if he had not been convicted sentenced and cashiered there is another aspect of this case which has become more or less prominent and that is its political aspect no man can make this a political question for me i do not propose to be bound by political considerations in making my decision upon this bill i care not what the politics or the religion or the color or the riches or the poverty ofthis man may be the question wish me is is it our duty to restore him because an injustice was done him another aspect of this case is the effort that has been and is being made to place the friends of this bill in the position of attacking the courtmartial and general grant and others i have no unkind thought or word for any member of that courtmartial or for general grant or for the gentlemen of the west point board i believe that the courtmartial under the pressure of the necessities of that time under thepublic influences that permeated the whole atmosphere under the passions and excitements incident to a state of war under the disasters that had befallen the union army especially the great disaster of fredericksburg which occurred while the courtmartial was sitting under the charge which was spread broadcast that there was insubordination on the part of prominent officers of the army which was leading to defeatunder all these circumstances i believe the courtmartial felt impelled conscientiously to find this man guilty and so convicted him of these charges under the law of military necessity as the members of that courtmartial then understood the situation in other words i believe that if that identical courtmartial had tried this case in a timeof peace and after the passions of the war had subsided it would not have convicted him on theevidence produced before it i have the very highest respect for the members of that courtmartial they were union soldiers who did their duty to their country and no man can make me antagonize men of that sort on any occasion or in behalf of any measure they deserve the homage love and respect oftheir countrymen and no word or thought of mine shall ever tarnish their fair fame or dim the luster of their noble achievements the first charge against fitzjohn porter is that he violated an order to march at 1 oclock on the morning of the 28th of august from warrenton junction and arrive at bristoe station at daylight by the arguments of gentlemen fitzjohn porter is placed in a procrustean bed from which it would be difficult to extricate him if the arguments be sound the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from michigan have argued that it was the dutyof porter to start at 1 oclock whatever his success might have been my friend general browne of indiana has argued that the essence of that order was that he should have arrived at bristoe station at daylight there is one plain difference of opinion between gentlemen in construing that order in my opinion neither one of these constructions is the correct one in my judgment fitzjohn porter as the commander of a corps separated by nine or ten miles from his commanderinchief had the right and it was his duty to exercisea wise discretion in reference to the circumstances and conditions of the situation now what was the condition of things that night of the 27th of august the best reply to that inquiry is the testimony of the witnesseswho were there on the ground i ask a careful and candid consideration of that testimony i ask that because i hope this cause will bejudged in the light of the evidence and not according to sentiment however elevated and i trust that passion and prejudice will have no influence in determining the fate of this bill now hear what the witnesses say about the situation of porter and his corps and what was said and done of these witnesses generals griffin morell butterfield and sykes colonel locke captains monteith and martin and lieutenant weld were with porters corps at warrenton junction general myers had charge of one of the wagontrainsthere was evidently more than one from general myerss evidenceand colonel clary and captain fifield the

few miles away and most of them know the road from warrenton junction to bristoe now listen to what these witnesses say nearly all this testimony i should have said was given before the courtmartial general griffin says question what was the condition of the troops under your command on the evening of the 27th with respect to fatigue answer they were much broken down i mean by that that they were very weary we had a great many stragglers that day q state what was the character of the night between the 27th and 28th of august a the nightof the 27th and the morning of the 28th was very dark itrained ta little about 10 oclock that night i should think very little just sprinkled lieutenant weld says question what kind of a night was tlhe 27th of august last answer it was very dark indeed i went to bed about to oclock and then the night was very dark i heard someone i think it was general morell who cane into camp before i went to bed saying lie had been trying to find general sykess headquarters and had lost his way general sykess headquarters were very near ours in the morning about 3 oclock i got up and it was drizzling general sykes testifies question state the character of the nightand tuny reports made to you by your aids as to the difficulties in starting before daylight ifany such were made aiswer the night was unusually dark before i directed the advance to be sounded i sent an aid deeamp to find i he road so as to lead the columi upon it le returned in a short time and told me the darkness was so greattiat lie could not distinguish the road he also told ine that lie was assisted in the search by several soldiers q state what you recollect of any difficulties which you met with in the road which impeded your march that morning and what steps were taken to remove such diffultics if any existed a as i anticipated we ran upon this trainof wagons within two miles of my camp they encumbered tle road for miles myself and staff officers were constantly engaged in opening tliewayfor the head of mycolumn on several occasions i had to take my mounted escort and place them on the road with drawn sabers to prevent wagons from closing lip ii intervals that occurred i do not think that in my military life i ever had such trouble as i had that day tile wagonmasters and teamsters were alike insubordinate again he says in giving reasons for suggesting the dclay in the march they were first that a night march is always fatiguing and injurious to troops that my command had already marched from twelve to fourteen miles that clay that i thought the darkness would cause confusion that the constant strean of wagons had passed ahead of us from the time my command reached warrenton jumction until dusk and above all thought that as but two hours or three hours at most would elapse between 1 oclock and daylight ve could make the march in much better order and march more rapidly by starting at dawn than by starting at the hour prescribed general morell says question state what occurred at the time of the receipt of the order or im mediatelyafterward between the accused and yourself and the other geicrals answer general porter said to us tia tie had received this order to march at 1 oclock that night we immediately spoke of the condition of our troopsthey beiig very much fatiguedand the darkness of the night and said that we didnt believe we could make any better progress by attempting to start at that hour tan if we waited until daylight after some little conversation general porter said well well start at 3 oclock get ready i immediately left his tent and went back to my division and made my preparations for moving q did not the generals then present yourself included express in strong terms t lie difficulty of inoving as early as 1 oclock or earlier than 3 oclock a yes on account of the dilticulty bf marching at night it was a very dark night it was cloudy trying to rain and did rain before morning general reynolds says in reference to the night of the 27th question wiat was tie character of the night answer it was a very dark night as was the succeeding night i recollect both of tihem distinctly for having been about a good deal after 12 oclock on each iiight q did you consider it too dark a night to march troops over an unfamiliar ountry a i should think so certainly without a guide or marching on roads i uont think it possible to march troops in such a night without having a good guide or marching on a road q if tie road over which you were to pass were to some considerable extent obstructed in several places would you have regarded time march of large masses of troops oil that night as practicable a i should not i should have considered it as a very precarious undertaking general heintzelinan says of that nigbt ticstion do you remember now what the character of the night was was it light or dark and rainy answer it was very dark in the course of the night we had a drizzling rain our tents were not pitched we laid out in the rain wce had difficulty in getting our wagons up general roberts porters accuser says of that night it was cloudy at times so as to be quite dark and threatened about 2 oclock to rain so that i got up from where i was sleeping on the ground found my wagon and got into it believing it would rain general butterfieldsays the order i believe was for general porter to move his forces at i oclock in the morning to bristoe station ie handed the order to general morell or to general sykes who were present and said there was a chiance for a short nap or something of that sort i dont remember tile exact words indicating that there was fryt little time for preparation general sykes or general morell i dont remember which one or both of theni spoke with regard to te fatigue our troops had endured the darkness of the night and the fact that in their judgment the troops would be of more service to start at a later hour than they would be to start at the hour named in reply to these remarks general porter spoke rather decidedly that there was the order that it must be obeyed that those who gave time order knew whether the necessities of the case would warra nt tle exertions that had to be made to comply with it i do not state that as tme exact words butas the substance of what tie said captain dekay who brought the order was then present ad was asked some questions about the road he stated that it was very dark and that the road was full of teams general sykes i think suggested that itwould be impossible for us to move at the hour named or if fhe road was full of teams that they couldnt find the way general porter called two aids and sent them off to investigate the condition of the road or ask general pope to have the road cleared so that we could come up when we got outside the darkness was so apparent to use such an expression and it seemed to be such a matter of impossibility to move that general porter said in consideration of all the circumstances i will fix the hour at 3 oclock instead of i you will be ready to move promptly and i subsequently wrote an order in general portersrtent for my command to be in line to march at 3 oclock colonel clary says in reply to a question as to whether he had passed over the road that night i think there were ten or twelve persons composing the party we didnt pass over the whole journey that night i lost the road and laid by for about 2 hours until daylight q how did you travel a on horseback q what was the character of the night a it was dark and cloudy colonel clary also says i was at warrenton junction on the 27th of august jast at 10 oclock that night i received a note from general porter to move the trains east on the railroad beyond and east of cedar run toward bristoe station i gave the orders to the proper persons connected with the trains and they commenced immediatelytomove the removal of the trains occupied me from 10 oclock until about 2 oclock in the morning at which time or perhaps a little later i myself left that point for bristoe station colonel locke testifies the order was received very nearly 10 oclock in the evening i was present that evening when a report was made to theaccused of thecondition of the road q do you remember what the report was if so state it a the report was thatthe road was very much blocked and that there were several bad places in the road 5 q did the corps march at 3 oclock a ra on the 28th of august a yes sir q what difficulties if any did they encounter and what was the cause of those difilculties a one great difficulty was the darkness of the night the next was the nearly impassable condition of the roads by reason of wagontrains q was the night very dark a extremely dark captain fifield who was instructed by colonel clary to clear the railroad of trains says question where did you go after leaving the trains answer i attempted to go to bristoestation but didnt reach there until 0ter daylight in the morning having lost my way in connection with the party i was with q how did you travel a on horseback q were there any wagons on the country road a there were q what distance were the wagons stretched along the road if they were stretched a i should think from between three and four miles from where we first struck the wagons nutil we got past the main body of the wagonsthey were scattered farther along 5 5 5 q what was the character of the night was it light or dark a the early part of tie night was a brightstarry night of summer without any moon but about half past 11 oclock it commenced overcasting and threatened rain very black clouds came up and it did sprinkle a little it was very dark from that time until toward morning captain monteith who with captain mcquade had been sent by general porter to look out the road to greenwich says question what sort of a night was it answer very dark we had trouble in getting back but a part of the way we didnt comeback the same road that we took going out wefound wagontrainson tle road from warrenton iuction going by catletts station we also found wagontrains coming in on the warrenton road intersecting the road thatruns by the railroad just below catletts station q in what condition did you lind the wagons when you were returning to general porter i a some of them were stopped and some of them were moving along the next morning the 28th of august when the march was taken up down the railroad general porter sent lieutenant weld and myself forward to use our efforts ia making the way for the infantry the road was blocked up with wagons as far as we could see q what efforts were actually made and how long were you in removing the wagons if you removed them atall a when we first came to the wagons the woods on both sides of the road were so thick and the road was so narrow that it was impossible to turn the wagonsout of the road and wecontinued on untilwecame toa placewhere the wagons could be doubled or turned out of the road we were also assisted by some cavalry sent with us after general porter sent us with some cavalrymen he also sent colonel locke with either a company or squadron of cavalry to labor in the same way captain drake do kay who bore the order to porter says question what was the character of the night of the 27th of august answer to the best of my recollection it was a cloudy night but not rainy 5 5 5 5 q had general porters command marched at i oclock in the morning would lie or would lie not have passed those wagons iii camp a he would have passed them in camp probably captain martin says we moved at between 3 and 4 oclock across the run less than a mile from camp and halted there and remained there until daylight we encountered a difficulty in getting out of camp in the darkness and got many of our carriages stuck in the run near the edge of the camp some of them were not got out until near daylight especially one battery wagon colonel brinton who went that night to find general porter about 12 oclock testifies question what was the character of the night answer the night was very dark and overcast q did the darkness materially impede you in your efforts to find your way to general porter a it did q and delayed you a yes sir q did you see any wagons on the road over which you traveled a yes the road from catletts station for half a mile westward was blocked up with wagons we ran into them constantly the road is there a narrow one leading through a wood and it was difficult for us to get along on that account we ran into a tree on the one hand or a wagon on the other without being able to distinguish until we were upon it q when you reached general porter did you speak to him of the condition in which you had found the road a yes sir i did and in answer to his inquiry concerning the state of the road generals warren buchanan mckeever ruggles patrick and mindil colonels thompson marston and smith majors hyland and earle lieutenants randol baker and davis testified before the west point board to substantially the same facts general patrick said my orderlies and one if not two members of the staff dismounted at different times to feel of the road it was one of the darkest nights that night of the 25th this is evidently a misprint it refers to the 27th as will clearly appear from his evidence on page 183 second part executive document 37 fortysixth congress when i came in with mcdowell i got lost on account of the darkness it was a very dark night so much so that we stretched men across the road quite a distanhe each side lest they should pass by the bivouac as it was so dark that the opening at the side of the road where the men were could not be seen colonel marston says question do you recollect the character of the night of the 27th of august 1862 answer part of it i do it was dark i should say until 12 oclock after that i dont know how it was from 9 to 10 oclock along there it was misty and raining a littlefine rain or heavy mist and quite dark i was out with the officer of the picket line and lost my way and it was so dark we could hardly flnd the way general warren said before the west point board that the wagonsreferring to the wagons on the road from warrenton junction to bristoe that nightwere pellmell parked like the ice that jams on the shore a contemporaneous corroboration will be found in porters dispatch to burnside from warrenton junction on the evening of the 27th in that dispatch he says wagons are rolling along the road as if a mighty power were propelling them those in the habit of construing evidence will appreciate theforce and trustworthiness of that kind of evidence now let me call attention to the testimony of general myers whom the government relied on before the courtmartial and who knew whether wagons blocked the road or not general myers in answer to interrogatories said quest ion do you remember the character of that nightthe night of the 27th of august if so will you please state it answer i was up nearly all that night it was quite dark there was no mood q did all wagons go into park or did some continue on the road a i think all my train went into park he says i think all my train went into park the wagons were coming in all night tand i could hear the wagons rolling nearly all night no trainsreferring to railroad trains passed me that night question you have been understood to say that the wagons were rolling all night answer yes going into pdrk as they got along all night the rear wagons taking a long time to come up in a long train of two thousand or three thousand wagons q then they were going into park all night from the road a yes wherever they could find

the city of new york and travel without interruption till he sips his coffee under the shadow of the palace of the eniperor of brazil for what reason should we build the canal here proposed what will

of railroads which reduce the time occupied in the transportation of goods who control the commerce of mexico foreigners who control the entire commerce of the argentine republic the italians who control the commerce ofthese other states the subjects of france and england and germany we have had no ability to compete with them because we had no vessels that could carry goods with equal promptitude now suppose that instead of constructing a canal of this kind evidently in the interest of private speculators we go to work and construct that railroad from the city of mexico across the isthmus through south and central america can we not transport all our commerce upon that route in seven days instead of four weeks and can we not by the great gain in point of time overcome the
