broadcasting co network monday evening april 22 1935 the new dealers confused and confounded and drifting into state socialism and as far away from the principles of thomas jefferson as it is possible to get are flying distress signals on the ship of state and sending out sos messages and pleas to cease opposition and uphold the newdeal measures my answer to that kind of unadulterated and brazen propaganda and effrontery to free americans is that it is the duty of all those who are opposed to the unsound unworkable and socialistic newdeal measures to speak out in no uncertain terms before our american system is undermined by the termites of the new deal and brought crashing into ruins on our heads as for me i propose to use every opportunity to expose and ridicule the fantastic newdeal experiments and raise my voice against the continuous and destructive efforts of the new dealers to destroy our representative and constitutional government and impose on the american people an autocratic bureaucratic socialistic dictatorial form of government without their approval or consent the newdeal administration pledged to reduce the running expenditures of the government by 25 percent and to balance the budget has deliberately repudiated these promises and has substituted in their place no economic or financial policy except to pile debt upon debt and borrow billions more billions and still more billions without a thought of extinguishing the debt or of the inevitable day of reckoning the result has been to destroy business confidence increase unemployment impoverish the people and retard or destroy recovery the attitude of the new dealers is similar to the old french king who said i am the state after me the deluge the fantastic increase in the national debt from twenty billions in 1933 to over thirtyfive billions and by the end of june this year to probably over forty billions is worthy of the vivid imagination of alice in wonderland in fact it is beginning to become more and more apparent that the american public have been elected to the role of alice in wonderland or more properly speaking blunderland the newdeal administration in the guise of the mad hatter invites everyone to help spend billions of the taxpayers money as if money grew on magical trees or was as numerous as the sands of the sea a puzzled somewhat skeptical alice asked the newdeal leadership some simple questions where are all the new billions coming from and how are they to be paid back to which the startled jabberwock replied that is not a fair question but ill tell you anyhow the more billions we spend the easier it is to balance the budget i see said alice first the new dealers balance the budget in their platform and campaign promises next by special message to congress a year ago and now by the definite assurance of the president that the 4 880 000 000 workrelief bill will balance the budget yes said the white knight of democracy and of blunderland james aloysius farley above fear and above reproach i have been thinking of a plan to dye ones whiskers green and then to hide behind a fan so that they cannot be seen oh said the cheshire cat your plan to balance the budget must be like me a vanishing type sometimes you see the head sometimes the tall but never the whole body but said the bewildered alice i dont even see any head or tail to the financing of the new deal measures and balancing the budget is nothing based upon common sense experience sanctity of contract or pledges and everything on expedients experiments and broken promises dont worry said a cynical father william the new dealers have a magic formula to balance the budgetinflation chaos bankruptcy and repudiation the limited time does not permit me to further discuss financing the newdeal measures and balancing the budget now let us turn to some of the other experiments president roosevelt in his book entitled government not politics published july 25 1932 said the chinaman would rather lose life than lose face dominated by the same spirit the new dealers vainly endeavor to make unsound and unworkable plans work merely to salvage their pride it is more important to save the country than to save the face of the new dealers the american people are sick of the depression but whichever way they turn they find a lot of inefficient visionary and jabbering bureaucrats not only blocking the way to recovery but threatening to take what little they have left the american people are bewildered and mystified by the honeyed words and the sugarcoated fireside chats of the president about a more abundant life in the future under a policy of destruction of crops birth control of pigs and a rapidly growing mountain of debt all that the american wage earner is asking for is the right to earn an honest living at the present time and educate and support his family properly in accordance with american standards of living the very word recovery means trying to get back something that was lost what has been lost under the guidance of the brain trusters most of whom are socialists and never identified with the democratic party but sound american principles of government based upon the wisdom and experience of the past the truth is that the american system is being hitched up with an unamerican system president roosevelt is trying to ride two horses going in opposite directions and that is why we are not getting anywhere our economic industrial and political problems can only be solved upon sound american principles of government for the best interest of all our people as they have in the past without recourse to socialism and communism of the left or fascism or hitlerism of the right the republican party must stand squarely without fear or favor for the american system and appeal to the people regardless of former party affiliations to come over and help this is the real issue it is the greatest in our countrys history and cuts across party lines the way slavery did the newdeal administration has not only repudiated every principle of jeffersonian democracy but of our american system and is rapidly drifting or perhaps it is truer to say rushing headlong into state socialism which is a kind of american fascism our american system based upon private initiative and reasonable profit spurred by competition has given a far more abundant life than any other economic system in the world today we find the new dealers following after the false economic gods of socialism and those theories of government ownership and operation pursued in soviet russia with disastrous results to the people who are undernourished and starving a very large part of the democratic party is not in favor of such radical experiments and is becoming more and more bewildered disappointed disgusted and deceived i was a former follower of theodore roosevelt and stood with him in 1912 on a platform of social and industrial justice and believe in those principles more today than ever before but believe in putting them into effect under the constitution of the united states and not outside of or around or beyond the constitution and our american system president roosevelt and his administration was elected on a sound platform promising a reduction of 25 percent of the running expenditures of the government sound money to be preserved at all hazards a reduction in the number of commissions to stop borrowing and deficits and a balanced budget during the first 6 months the president gave an admirable administration and tried to live up to his promises and pledges confidence was restored and there was a partial recovery and several million american wage earners were put back to work then something happened revolutionary in nature the president called in a lot of radical and socialist professors and visionaries to experiment upon our people and our institutions and if permitted to continue will bring down our american system in ruins upon the heads of all our people these radicals socialists and near communists were not elected by the people to office to tear down our american institutions the socialists and communists received only a million votes if however our american system is not to be scrapped without ever being submitted to the nation for a vote it is clearly the duty of the republican party as the party of opposition to force the issue before the great power of the administration and its enormous and relentless publicity stifles and smothers the issue the question is not that of conservatism or liberalism although i am a political liberal who believes in the rights and capacity of the people to rule themselves and with lincoln that human rights are superior to property rights and that labor is prior to capital the republican party must have definite clearcut policies and become a fighting militant organization and purge itself of all who do not believe in our american system there can be no compromise between the american system and the alien and socialistic policies of the new dealers who are changing our form of government without the consent of the people and setting up a bureaucratic and autocratic form of government foreign to all american principles and ideals and similar in nature to fascism hitlerism or communism and everything except americanism the republican party must purge itself on one side of all who do not believe in our american system and on the other of special privilege and selfish interests who seek to exploit it we must get back to the early principles of our party the sooner we get back to the principles advocated by abraham lincoln of faith in the people free institutions and popular government the sooner will the confidence of the people be restored in the republican party it is becoming more and more apparent that the nation cannot long endure half for the american system and half for some imported foreign form of socialism or third economy as described by prof rexford guy tugwell a former member of the league for industrial democracy and the peoples lobby both of which are against the profit system and in favor of government ownership newspaper reports state that professor tugwell will be in charge of the disbursement of 900 000 000 of the funds carried in the workrelief bill and may become the most important administrative officer in the relief program with full control of rural rehabilitation soil erosion submarginal land activities and perhaps the mississippi valley development such an appointment is a typical example and an unanswerable reason for the loss of confidence by american business men small and large in the newdeal policies how can business men investors and employers of labor place any confidence in the new dealers who have opposed in the past and are still opposed in their hearts to our entire industrial system based on private initiative and profit let the republican party face the issue squarely and uphold our american system and fearlessly announce that it can only be improved by sound american principles of government if it has failed then it should be scrapped for collectivism regimentation a crushing bureaucracy government ownership and state socialism the battle should be joined by the upholders of our american system and those opposed whether for state socialism communism or fascism the american system is based on three separate and independent branches of government under the constitution acting as checks and balances on each other in order to preserve the rights and liberties of the american people until the advent of the newdeal administration no american questioned our representative form of government and the capacity and intelligence of the people to govern themselves within the confines of the constitution two years of newdeal rule has seen a cowardly supine and partisan congress surrender its legislative powers month by month upon the arrogant demands of the chief executive and set up an autocrat in the white house at first these powers were delegated on a supposedly temporary basis in an economic emergency but that is no longer the case president roosevelt apparently is obsessed with the idea that he is divinely sent to rule and insists on permanent autocratic powers in defiance of our representative form of government and the constitution not satisfied with driving a subservient congress to turn over the power to determine the value of money and the making of tariff schedules he has taken away from congress the control of the purse strings the main reason for its existence the new workrelief bill totaling almost 5 000 000 000 has left congress with scarcely any more legislative powers than ghandi has clothing the president is now demanding control over both credit and currency through the new banking bill establishing virtually a central bank under the political control of the president through the federal reserve board by the end of the present session congress will be nothing more than a debating society like the parliaments of italy and germanynothing but a rubber stamp to affirm the edict of the president the rape of the legislative powers of congress and the betrayal of representative and constitutional government is an issue that the republican party must meet without compromise if we remain silent on this issue and drift into an autocratic socialistic dictatorship then we cannot avoid a share of the blame for not taking up the challenge if the american people want to change their form of government they have a right to do so but a partisan patronagedriven congress has no right to change our form of government without the approval and consent of the people up to the time of the new deal and its foreign imported ideals the government was except in time of war conceived to be the servant and not the master of the people the american system has demonstrated throughout the years that it stood for the greatest good of the greatest number and for equal opportunities for all under it american labor has been the best paid the best housed the best fed the best clothed the most contented and the freest in the world it has been upheld by every prominent democrat including grover cleveland woodrow wilson william jennings bryan alfred e smith john w davis albert c ritchie and newton baker all of a sudden the new dealers tell us because we are in a depression that everything is wrong rotten and corrupt in our economic and political system and all must be scrapped for a new form of government with a beneficient dictator in the white house without attempting or desiring to formulate a republican platform i submit that any republican program must not pussyfoot or compromise on the following fundamental issues first restoration of representative and constitutional government by restoring to congress the powers surrendered to the executive branch of government and the reestablishment of a government of law second restore business confidence and put american wage earners to work by withdrawing the government as quickly as possible from control of business and from competition with industry and from direct interference with business by executive orders and drastically modifying the n r a a few fundamental codes are all that is necessaryone for natural resources oil coal etc one for fair competition strong enough to protect the small man in paying his employees according to american standards one to do away with child labor and another for a minimum wage scale and maximum hours of labor third establish and maintain a stabilized currency on a sound basis fourth repeal the a a a and give the secretary of agriculture emergency power to fix national minimum prices for domestic consumption which is the only way to regain the wheat and cotton markets of the world advocate an economy of abundance not scarcity and creation of true wealth not its destruction protect all farm products from foreign competition by adequate duties or an embargo if necessary establish an equilibrium between the products of the farms mines and factories assure the farmer the cost of production plus a reasonable profit establish a reserve supply of meat grain and other foodstuffs whenever surpluses arise to provide 1 years supply for the american people against drought climate conditions undernourishment or famine but not to be used except in war or other emergency fifth abolish all processing taxes and taxes on production do away with taxexempt securities put taxes where they can be seen and felt on income inheritance and sales practice national economy balance the budget and fund the national debt for 50 years sixth preserve the home market for american goods and retain the american wage scale and standards of living protect the american wage earner against competition from the cheap products of the lowpaid labor in japan and europe seventh abolish all government publicity bureaus they are nothing more than political propaganda machines deceiving the people back home creating a censorship of news endangering free institutions and have no place in our american system eighth social and economic justice provide a reasonable and adequate oldage pension or retirement plan without political advantage to any group or party develop under normal times an unemploymentinsurance fund under state control improve the means of distribution and reduce the high cost of living on foodstuffs for american wage earners and consumers and enable the housewives to balance their family budgets ninth provide for national defense but not for aggression take the profit out of war and prohibit the loaning of money to foreign nations stay out of all foreign entanglements leagues of nations world courts sanctions or war commitments keep out of all foreign boundary disputes ancient blood feuds and intrigues cease passing moral judgments on foreign nations stop trying to police the world or to pick the chestnuts out of the fire for other nations and above all mind our own business as we have plenty of problems to attend to in our own country at the present time tenth provide for the fullest freedom of speech of the press and over the radio for american citizens except to the extent of urging the overthrow of our republican form of government by force and violence which is guaranteed to each state by the federal constitution enact deportation laws against all aliens who seek to spread class hatred promote strikes riots and industrial unrest and to undermine and tear down our free institutions and give their jobs to industrious and loyal american citizens now walking the streets and who have faith in our american system eleventh reaffirm our faith in the early principles of the republican party enunciated by abraham lincoln who repeatedly stated that he had obtained all his political principles from thomas jefferson build a bridge on the firm foundation of the rights and liberties of the people under the constitution so that all disgusted and deceived jeffersonian democrats can cross over to help elect a republican president in 1936 in order to oust the new dealers who have all but destroyed jeffersonian principles that have been the creed of the democratic party for over 135 years twelfth set up a bookkeeping system in the nation so that we shall always know the extent of our wealth and its distribution and currently know our actual position in international finance and trade"],

democratic members of the house i come to the floor today out of a sense of sympathy for them i really am concerned about them because of the futility of the excuses that have been offered for the failure of the present administration to meet that campaign promise it really does arouse sympathy in me for the members on the democratic side i have listened to the efforts you have put forth trying to explain away that 25percent promise i have listened during the week to the denunciations that were made on the floor of the house of that fearless former governor of new york who was willing in a public address to remind the present administration of some of its campaign promises i noticed how some of the members on the democratic side of the house squirmed and how they wriggled while a part of that denunciation was being made i say i come today really prompted by a heart generous and gracious to you i bring you my condolences and sympathies the observations i am going to make are prompted in no sense by either a spirit of partisanship or a spirit of criticism they are made out of that spirit of good will and affection that always should prevail among colleagues in a group such as this i think it was most unfortunate that the gentleman who immediately preceded me in his enthusiasm for the defense of a reclamation project failed to be courteous enough to the gentleman from new york to permit the gentleman from new york to interrogate him with respect to the statements that the gentleman from washington made in answer to the statements made by the gentleman from new york on reclamations in spite of our partisanship in spite of our enthusiasm in spite of our interest for a particular project we should never lose sight of that spirit of good will that should prevail among a group such as ours so i come to you men on the democratic side today sympathetically you men who have been trying to excuse and explain and condone the colossal failure to even approximate the promises of a reduction of 25 percent in the cost of government i really bring you an offer and contribution of helpfulness that contribution of helpfulness has to do with this reclamation business i want to direct the attention of the membership today to the report on this present interior department appropriation bill i want to direct attention particularly to that portion of the appropriation which hasto do with reclamation appropriations in all kindliness i ask you the question whether you feel you are directing your efforts in the proper direction so far as that 25percent promise goes by increasing this reclamation appropriation by 2 196 500 over what was provided for the present fiscal year of course i recognize my limitations probably i am not approaching this 25percent reduction properly probably you feel that that 25 percent instead of being a minus was intended to be a plus or a multillication but at all events increasing by 2 196 500 one single item in this appropriation measure does not in any way contribute to the possibility of an approximation of that old campaign promise let me read you the reason that is given for this increase of 2 000 000 this increase over the current appropriation is due to the need for additional funds for operation and maintenance charges on new land being brought under cultivation again i am thinking of that campaign promise of 25percent reduction and i am wondering whether that new cultivation program and this increase in appropriation for reclamation bears any stamp at all of real consistency if we have too much under cultivation so that the secretary of agriculture feels it is necessary to plow under and destroy then why should we be spending 2 000 000 for increasing the program of reclamation in the west however you on the democratic side should direct your attention as you honestly and sincerely and faithfully try to live up to this campaign promise of 25percent reduction to the fact that 75 000 of this program is for the establishment of an operation and maintenance administration what do we mean by that we mean by that more jobs we mean by that taking care of more of the faithful we mean by that that this already stupendous horde of faithful democratic appointees is to be further increased surely you realize that this will not help you to live up to this promise but it will make it more diffi cult for you to approximate this 25percent reduction i shall be glad to yield and i shall be courteous enough to yield to the distinguished gentleman from washington if he feels that any of the statements i make with respect to reclamation are either unfounded or unjustified but i want to direct your attention to pages 197 and 198 of the hearings where there is set forth a table which came as a result of the request of the gentleman from massachusetts he requested information as to the sums going into reclamation projects from emergency and relief funds this table on pages 197 and 198 shows that almost 350 000 000 of reclamation projects have already been provided for under emergency and relief measures that have never been approved by the congress of the united states i want you to look at a few of them these are provided for under the carte blanche authority for spending money given by this democratic house facing as it did this promise of a 25percent reduction in maintenance charges i say these are provided as a result of that carte blanche authority to spend money here is one item 170 000 000 to go to a reclamation project in california i think california is a fine state and i in no sense criticize california but 170 000 000 without one word appearing in any hearing before any appropriation subcommittee to justify this expenditure is a dangerous practice if you are to make good your promise i come down to another item and again i feel i must suggest and invite any interrogation that the gentleman from washington may care to direct to mei find that there is an item of 63 000 000 for a certain project in the state of washington with no justification for it before any house committee no justification before any appropriation subcommittee never passed on by the congress in fact it has been said in times pastand i am glad the distinguished gentleman from colorado is hereit has been admitted in times past that many of these projects had heretofore not only failed to receive the approbation of the committee but that they had been frowned upon and criticized i turn to another item and find 20 500 000 provided for a reclamation project in the state of arizona with no justification for the expenditure no explanation to this congress as to why this project should be inaugurated is there any wonder that i am concerned about your campaign promise to reduce expenditures 25 percent is there any wonder my heart is touched with a sense of sympathy for you"], [0.018562177196145058, 0.018562177196145058, 0, "that is a fair question but it is one that cannot be answered correctly decisively satisfactorily probably because it is purely a matter of opinion whether the dole or socalled made work has the greater tendency to break down the morale of the person on relief i cannot say i believe their morale is being impaired on the whole if relief must be extended to those who are ablebodied capable of working then by all means they should work according to their ability to work but in my judgment the work should be not purely made work in the sense of giving them something to do for those working at such projects realize full well they are receiving only a dole but they should be given work on worthwhile permanent projects that are selfliquidating and that are necessary what can we do about it there is a limit as before stated to the help which can be given in view of this dire need is it not time that we take more thought as to the amounts which we are now appropriating permit me to call your attention to the bill now before us can we not cut the appropriations in this bill so that relief may be extended to those in such desperate situations as that just indicated look at this passamaquoddy proposition here is a great project of extremely doubtful value it is my understanding that in the beginning there was an adverse report as to whether it was a selfliquidating proposition but if it is to be built why should it not be constructed in the ordinary way but what is the government attempting to do at the present time among other items is a dormitory of 87 rooms for the accommodation of 145 persons who are to work on the project with mess arrangements for approximately twice that number the furnishings of this dormitory are to cost 33 000this for 145 persons it matters not that these dormitories are to be rented and that a profit may be returned to the government in the end the dormitory will be dismantled will serve no useful purpose why should not the workers be housed as such workers usually are while people are hungry while people are cold while children are going to school in kalamazoo and vicinity without sufficient covering for their feet and their bodies the government is asking for 217 ash receivers for the use of 145 persons who are to work on the passamaquoddy and these receivers be it known are to be furnished with or without design in white black green blue and yellow two hundred and seventeen ash receivers for 145 workers then there is silverware the ordinary knives forks and spoons will not do it must be silverware there must be bath mats there must be 248 dozen bath and other towels there must be 10 dozen linen scarfs there are upholstered chairs there are love seats there are pictures 120 of them for 90 rooms there are candlesticks of northern maple of colonial style there are pewter plates oval shape to be used with these candlesticksi quote for ornamental purposes there are electric dishwashers what becomes of those 500 young ladies who were trained for domestic service if the object of the appropriations is relief and employment why use an electric dishwasher there are two radios presumably to bring in the speeches of statesmen clocks grandfather type two of them walnut mahogany or maple colonial style 8day spring driven with pendulum movement westminster chimes so that the tired and weary souls may be musically told the hour and the clocks be it known must be of a standard make manufactured in the year in which they are to be purchased let me get a little nearer to kalamazoo to that city which sends out the information that it is attempting to feed some of its people on 5 cents a mealto my home town of allegan where on the 25th day of february 1935 there appeared in the allegan gazette and the allegan news an announcement by the local e r a supervisor that classes for the teaching of basketball dramatics chorus sewing dancing bridge playing and orchestral training would be made available to the women of allegan who were more than 16 years of age money for the teaching of dancing bridge playing when down at kalamazoo 23 miles away the unfortunate ones are limited to 5 cents per meal where is the sense to all this note this editorial from the allegan news of february 21 1936allegan is a town of less than 4 000 is it any wonder that the people are getting heartily sick of the present administration and its program of spending billions of dollars in order to place men and women at a job any job especially when we review the kind of projects through which millions of dollars of the taxpayers money is being wasted in this city we have w p a workers in charge of ice skating and we even have come to the point where we have w p a employees holding pingpong schools and conducting checker tournaments or games in this little village of mine of less than 4 000 people is there a boy or a girl in that town old enough to strap or a pair of skates who does not know how to skate who caiinot go on the river the lakes the ponds in the winter skate and in the summer swim like a fish i am not mentioning these items for political purposes i am mentioning them to see if we cannot get together as ordinary fellows and cut out what we might term this monkey business think of teaching our boys and girls to skate and how to play hockey while down in kalamazoo they only have 5 cents a meal to furnish food for some of their people the question may be asked what are you going to do about it the president has made the statement that taxes come from the sweat of mans brow and labor what should we do i know this statement is not popular but why should we not now be honest with ourselves why should we not be honest with our folks at home why should we not take the position that for every bill appropriating 1 or 100 we also bring in a provision levying the tax to pay that bill why not let the tax bill follow the appropriation bill i have faith enough in my people at home to believe they are

with this debt of 32 000 000 000 which we now owe under this administration whose spokesman says nobody wants to curtail with a balanced budget talk about the 200 000 000 proposed in this bill why it would not pay interest on the debt for 212 monthsl if every nickel that is to be raised under this bill were accumulated and devoted to nothing but repayment of the debt it would take 300 years to pay it off when the secretary of the treasury or the president suggests that a small proportion of this tax might be set aside toward paying the debt they apparently have never realized that it is much easier to contract a debt than to pay one you may think i am facetious but my friends i will tell you the only way to pay this debt offand i refer you to the story of american historythe only way the debts of this nation ever have been paid has been through republican administrations the big debts have all been accumulated under democratic administrations yet the republicans have had the responsibility for paying them now i say to you that the people all over this country are coming to their senses they are realizing the enormity of this debt they are realizing the futility of all these experiments of priming the pump and this is evidenced by the wholesale disregard for president roosevelts theory evidenced in the press today what does it show to me i think i can clearly see that in 1936 the people of this country are going to consider this wild orgy of extravagant spending and these dangerous excursions into the land of communism and they are again going to say to the republican party come forth assume this burden and begin to pay off the most colossal debt that ever afflicted a nation my republican friends if they place this responsibility upon us it is going to be a tremendous one it is not going to be something that we can accept lightly in the exultation of victory it is going to be a responsibility that will stay with us night and day it will be our constant companion and it will tax the patience and fortitude and ability of our ablest statesmen we will have to take the responsibility of paying this colossal debt or else we will see the nation go down and down to destruction my friends the real basis of my opposition is not the terms of the bill it is that i am unalterably opposed to any program of taxation that will feed any more of the peoples money into the maw of this colossal monster that consumes money at the rate of about 28 000 000 per day and that seems never to be satiated or satisfied under our theory of government it is the duty of congress to raise the money with which the government is to operate and congress passes the duty of preparing this legislation on to the ways and means committee this committee for this reason is the most important of all committees of either the house or the senate all bills for raising revenue must originate in the committee they are not supposed to originate in the president this bill did in fact originate in the president when the president sent up his message on june 19 asking for tax legislation he thought it could be prepared and passed in 5 days probably he thought that it was just too bad that he had to present it to the house at all and that he should have had the right to pass it without bothering to submit it to congress that is what he thought about the n r a and the supreme courts connection therewith but my friends the founders of the republic decreed that the congress should have this responsibility and they said so in the constitution it is likely that the president chafes at the inconvenience the congress and the supreme court cause him but these two bodies have equal place with the executive in the conduct of the greatest nation on the face of the globe neither should usurp the functions of the other and when they do they may expect to be set right when the president was a candidate in 1932 he made many speeches and many promises he stated at pittsburgh on october 19 1932 i regard reduction in federal spending as one of the most important issues of this campaign in my opinion it is the most direct and effective contribution that government can make to business and in sioux city on september 29 1932 he said i shall use this position of high responsibility to discuss up and down the country in all seasons at all times the duty of reducing taxes of increasing the efficiency of government of cutting out the underbrush around our governmental structure of getting the most public service for every dollar paid by taxation this i pledge you and nothing i have said in the campaign transcends in importance this covenant with the taxpayers of this country in spite of all these promises we find the president demanding more taxes and spending more money in his 21 2 years of administration than all the presidents spent from the day of washington down to the days of woodrow wilson he spent more in 21 2 years than all these other presidents spent in 124 years until this spending spree is stopped we should refuse to pay the fiddler mr roosevelt also said in his speech of acceptance as an immediate program of action we must abolish useless offices we must merge we must consolidate subdivisions of government but in spite of his promises to reduce the expense of the government by 25 percent and to abolish useless commissions and offices what do we behold according to authentic records we find that on february 28 1933 which was 4 days before the present administration took office that the number of government employees was 563 487 but on may 31 1935 there were 712 112 persons doing the same class of work thus it is seen that the number has been increased by 148 625 since that time the number has increased about 5 000 in spite of all this wasteful extravagance we find more people out of work than at any time since roosevelt came into power my friends i have always been in favor of requiring those financially able to pay their fair share of the operation of the government but as senator carter glass said when he was secretary of the treasury there is a limit beyond which tax rates will not produce in the same proportion as they will produce at lower rates the law of diminishing returns applies in taxation as surely and as accurately as anywhere else i had intended discussing at length the taxes provided in this bill i shall only mention them in a cursory way the income tax is changed so that upon incomes of 50 000 and upward the rates are stepped up from 30 percent to 75 percent on incomes of 5 000 000 or more even with these high figures this bill will only bring about forty million additional into the treasury the presidents special recommendation for a graduated corporation tax was treated very shabbily by the democratic members of the committee for at first they had about agreed to reject it but in order to save the presidents face the committee after days of secret sessions finally by a close vote decided to reduce the rate on corporations with earnings of less than 15 000 from 13 percent to 131 4 percent and to raise the rates on all corporations with earnings over 15 000 to 141 4 percent thus they placated the president with one slight step of graduation the committee was compelled to step into a field not recommended by the president in order to get enough taxes to make a bill worth while they increased the excess profits on corporations so as to bring an additional revenue of about seventyfive or eighty million then the committee passed on to the levy of additional taxes on inheritances and upon gifts no doubt the senate will make many changes in this unscientific bill therefore summing up what i have said at the risk of some repetition let me say when the president tried to imitate huey long with his sharethewealth tax scheme and to soak the rich harder than the original soaktherich man he found that they inimitable his tax plan has been a fizzle they say a bumblebee is bigger when it is born than at any other time that is the way with the presidents tax plan every newspaper in the country is opposed to it it is unwise unscientific and illconceived it was never anything but a political gesture in the first place no tax bill should be passed until the taxspending agencies of the government show an inclination to curtail this wild reckless orgy of wastefulness which is carrying the country straight into bankruptcy in the second place the small amount that will be realized from this bill will not run the government 10 days it will not pay the interest on the public debt for 3 months in the third place it is purely political as proof of this it is to be observed that none of the tax provided in the bill is to be paid until long after the 1936 presidential election the only solution of the serious situation is for us to live the best we can until 1936 when the present administration will be thoroughly discredited and the people will turn to the republican party as they have always done then ours will be the great and difficult task of bringing the country back the republican party paid the debts that wilson left us at the rate of a billion a year for 10 years it will be our responsibility to do it again we can do it we did it before and reduced the taxes several times in those 10 years what we need in our country is not more tax on income but more income to tax the president by his attitude on this tax bill has lost prestige tremendously he has lost the support of the press and has lost prestige with his party party leaders have refused to go along with him the organization is disintegrating selfpreservation is the only cohesive principle holding them together now"], [0.021574854850769043, 0.978425145149231, 1,

it was the inspiration of this old adage that gets around so much about liars being able to figure but figures not lying one can use figures and distort them to his own use and probably exemplify what shakespeare once said that the devil can cite scripture for his purpose but in the final analysis one proves exactly nothing when i journey from washington to illinois and go through ohio i see a huge signboard out there along route 40 which says ye shall know the truth and the truth will set ye free occasionally we nail truth down but do not do a very good job and it comes up again and when we discuss this matter of reciprocaltrade treaties and bandy figures about if they are distorted and if they are not founded in fact they prove just exactly nothing so the opponents and proponents of the reciprocaltrade treaties are going to prove their case only in proportion as they adhere strictly to the facts and reliable figures i have undertaken to do that in connection with some tables that i have assembled dealing with the effect of reciprocaltrade treaties upon the state of illinois this chamber has resounded with a lot of oratory and rhetoric with respect to reciprocaltrade treaties ever since 1933 much of the argument that has been advanced has been ineffective because it has been too local and some of the argument that has been advanced is ineffective because it is too abstract i thought it might be a rather interesting thing if one took the whole schedule of reciprocaltrade treaties and related them to every item with which imported goods might be in competition with the items manufactured in a state like illinois or that are produced and grown on the farms in illinois first of all i want the record to show the number of treaties in effect and with what countries up to and including the 1st of march 1936 10 trade agreements had been completed the first one with cuba on the 3d of september 1934 with belgium on may 1 1935 with haiti on june 3 1935 with sweden august 5 1935 with brazil january 1 1936 with canada january 1 1936 with the netherlands february 1 1936 with switzerland february 15 and with honduras march 2 an agreement has been signed with our little sister republic of south america colombia on the 3d of september 1935 but it does not become effective until 30 days after the signature of the president of the republic of colombia attachas and that signature has not yet been attached incidentally agreements are pending at the present time with costa rica el salvador finland france guatemala italy nicaragua and spain with exception of the trade treaty that is in effect with cuba concessions that are made under this reciprocaltrade program obtain alike for virtually all of the nations with which we have any kind of a trade status with the exception of germany so that all the concessions that the united states has made thus far under these treaties to the respective countries named in the 10 treaties that have been signed will run alike to all countries everywhere in the world with the exception of germany now how do these agreements affect illinois that is the whole purpose of what i want to insert in the record i am not trying to be persuasive this afternoon because after all the figures are far more persuasive than any rhetoric that i may be able to advance the first table i am going to insert deals with illinois industries as reported by the census of manufactures it shows all manufacturing industries in illinois the number of wage earners in 1933 and the value of the products produced in addition thereto it will show a total of 38 select industries with the number of wage earners employed and the value of the product the second table will deal with illinois crops livestock and livestock products showing first of all the total income to the farmers in 1933 and 1934 for a total of 78 crops then the total of seven major crops the next table will show livestock and livestock products with special emphasis upon six different items that constitute the majority portion of the income of illinois farmers the next table will deal with names of imported commodities and the countries from which they are imported it is all set up so that at a glance you can tell exactly from what countries these items are imported that are in competition with the products grown or produced in illinois the next table will deal with a select group of 45 products showing the quantity and value of the imports for 1933 1934 and 1935 it occurs tome that if these tables are examined with any degree of application by the members of congress they are in themselves going to present a rather persuasive picture but they do not go far enough unless we also show the wage scales that obtain in the different countries where the products are manufactured that are in competition with the fabricated products from my own state to make it more persuasive i have included tables of wages paid in selected german industries swiss industries swedish industries wages paid in canada wages paid to agricultural workers in poland wages paid in selected french industries wages paid in the united kingdom various daily wages paid in tokyo these figures have been converted so as to take account of the difference in exchange on the basis of the last figure available so that no proponent of trade agreements can say that we have left out something by which they can establish some point of dissimilarity when they undertake to make an argument about the only thing i want to emphasize in connection with these tables is that the meatpacking industry is not only one of the principal industries in illinois but that hogs and cattle make up more than half the income of illinois farmers however despite that fact the importation of meat products jumped from 62 476 133 pounds in 1933 to 115 059 114 pounds in 1935 that is a jump of over 100 percent we have three watch and clock factories in illinois yet the value of imported watch and clock movements jumped from 1 656 000 in 1933 to 4 359 247 in 1935 corn is the principal cereal grain grown in illinois yet the imports of corn jumped from a mere 160 228 bushels in 1933 to 43 242 296 bushels in 1935 that is a rather healthy increase wheat ranks second as a major cereal grain grown in our state yet the imports of wheat jumped from 31 383 bushels in 1933 to 27 438 870 bushels in 1935 i might say in connection with corn that a friend of mine by the name of ralph t ainsworth of mason city ill who operates the ainsworth financial service and who has spent a lifetime gathering farm statistics right in the corn belt which he sends to farffiers farmmarket operators and others had this to say with respect to the importations of argentine corn i quote him argentine corn is sifting its way farther into the interior as each week goes by the southern hemisphere flint corn may now be had as far north as memphis as far east as buffalo and in all that territory west of the rocky mountainsand then get this significant factat prices far below the price of domestic corn if we can ship corn by the boatload from the argentine and unload it at baltimore or galveston and then send it by rail out into the corn belt where we grow millions and millions of bushels of corn and the price is below the domestic market for corn you can see what will happen mr wallace can pass that off by saying that the total importation of corn for 1935 does not exceed the corn grown in a single iowa county but that is quite beside the point for if that flinty argentine corn comes into the corn market it has a most disastrous effect upon the price and you will see a recession i am not a market prophet but i venture to say that within the next 60 days you are likely to see a 10cent drop in the price of corn largely because of this lowpriced argentine corn if the starch factories farmers feeders and others can buy this corn cheaper than they can buy domestic corn you know what will happen to the domestic price oats is the third largest cereal crop in illinois the importation of oats jumped from 132 337 bushels in 1933 to over 10 106 903 bushels in 1935 it is one of the most amazing things in the history of our internal economy that we have to import so much corn wheat and oats when we pay good cash out of uncle sams treasury to take the most fertile acres in the united states of america out of cultivation in the prairie state and the illinois valley nearly onethird of the cash income of our farmers comes from milk butter and dairy products yet importations of butter jumped from 1 021 806 pounds in 1933 to 22 674 643 pounds in 1935 i am going to wind up my remarks by this very abrupt observation that i shall be very much interested in the reactions of laboring men and farmers in illinois when these authentic authoritative figures come to their attention it requires no argument and no persuasion on my part the figures will speak for themselves now how do these agreements affect illinois the census of manufactures published by the department of commerce shows that in 1933 the manufacturing industries in illinois which employed more than 2 500 wage earners had a total pay roll of 420 334 persons and that the value of the product of such industries was 2 502 175 233 sixtynine percent of these wage earners were employed in the 38 industries listed in the table which i am inserting in the record and the value of the products of these 38 industries was 1 548 343 441 a glance at this table will indicate what these industries are what they produce the

than 100 000 000 checks which the office was called upon to handle the evidence also indicates that the accounting office does not have at this time facilities deemed adequate for carrying out the responsibilities which should be properly intrusted to it the statement was made that if these facilities were available an additional 100 000 would be requested in order to carry out the proper functions of the office the evidence also indicates that while progress has been made in bringing the emergency organizations under the general accounting office for audit there are still some 25

duly chartered by the american federation of labor in the early part of this year the international seamens union held a convention here in washington d c that convention anticipated just such an outlaw strike as is now fostered in new york the convention had from day to day received clear and positive proof that notorious fomenters of strife were at work seeking to bring about a tieup of shipping along the atlantic coast for any reason or no reason whatever it was because of this clear understanding of the situation that all the delegates at the convention including the radicals voted

persons intended to stampede the seamen into a strike under circumstances leading straight to disaster it being the opinion of the convention that strike action on the atlantic and gulf under existing

going a little too far if in amending the law to give them relief we do not require them to file their rates with the commission in the proper way an examination of the reports of the interstate commerce commission discloses hundreds and hundreds of decisions in rate and valuation cases many of them bearing on section 4 in my opinion around these decisions has been developednot only by the federal government but through our various state publicutility commissionsrules for guidance of counties states and the federal government in their railroad problems i think this procedure has been built up beneficially to the railroad interests because of this litigation and these decisions it has resulted in sound railroad management with a definite policy of trying to serve the country i am afraid that if we eliminate section 4 altogether we will be taking out of the record this tremendous amount of work that has been done through litigation bringing about certain standards of railroad management reference was made by my colleague about the attitude of the massachusetts organization of associated industries the traffic committee of this organization is on record as being in favor of this bill but many individual members of the organization have registered their personal objection to the bill this has no bearing on it for in my opinion as a matter of fact as a citizen of massachusetts and a new englander it will not result in relief for our railroads so i am not speaking here because i am trying selfishly to hold something in my district or trying selfishly to get something for my district because it will not affect new england or new england railroads one iota and we probably will not get a pound of additional tonnage one way or the other whether this bill is adopted or not but i am seriously conscious of the fact that there is an element of danger when you go too far in trying to do a good deed it may kick back at you and do the reverse of what you expect

to me at this time to address my colleagues for a few brief moments concerning the life and character of a man the seat of government of the united states furnishes the average american citizen who is privileged here to visit with a succession of thrills he is intensely interested when from the galleries he observes for the first time the congress of the united states working out the problems of legislation he views with approbation the capitol and majestic governmental buildings he admires that mansion the home of the chief executive of the nation and eagerly hopes for a glimpse of its occupant he is amazed at the magnitude of the library of congress and is awed by the dignity and solemnity of the supreme court but when his pilgrimage takes him to the west end of the mall near the banks of the potomac river he is overwhelmed by the magnificent edifice that is brought to his vision mounting the steps he ascends at the summit he pauses but one object arrests his attention it is a huge sculptured figure of a man seated in a chair a tall gaunt homely man dressed in coarse homespun clothes a man with a kind face and yet a face that is tinged with sadness day in and day out year in and year out in sunshine in rain in sleet in snow this figure sits in his chair gazing ahead gazing at that lofty monument erected in memory of the father of his country gazing beyond that gigantic shaft to the very capitol itself where as a member of this body this figure in form of a mortal man once honorably filled a seat it is concerning this man that i am privileged to address you today

the republic into which abraham lincoin was born was then scarcely 20 years of age his father thomas lincoln a carpenter by trade was a genial goodnatured fellow popular with the townfolk and known throughout the vicinity as a kind and obliging neighbor his mother nancy hanks lincoln a native of virginia in whose veins flowed the blood of the lees was a charming darkhaired gentle woman willing to brave the dangers and hardships of a pioneer life and devoted to her husband and family young lincolns opportunities for education and advancement were far from encouraging his parents were desperately poor schools were few and far between and too he was needed at home to help his father provide the necessaries of life his mother taught him to read and write and with these accomplishments and a firm determination to raise himself by his bootstraps he eagerly sought and read every book available to him often walking many miles to obtain them in 1816 the lincolns moved to a tract of land on little pigeon creek in indiana and 2 years later the year of the admission of illinois into the union his good mother worn weary and broken down with the poverty privations and sacrifices she had endured whispered gently to her 9yearold son be a good man abe and passed to another world lincoln dearly loved his mother and her personality and the influence she must have exercised during his boyhood without doubt shaped his character in the troublesome years that were to follow he always spoke tenderly of her and on one occasion after he had reached the zenith of his career said all that i am and all i hope to be i owe to my angel mother it was while residing in indiana that lincoln had an opportunity for a few months to attend a logcabin school"],

reference to those things however the project below sioux city has been authorized for many years as i stated in regard to the other one which the gentleman inquired about awhile ago the deepening of the mississippi river to the twin cities may i say that many years ago there was a 6foot project there three dams were built and the keokuk dam was purchased there was one dam built at rock island the hastings dam and the dam at minneapolis those dams have been completed for a number of years in the bill of 1930 a provision in regard to that was agreed to in the house and amended in the senate on a tentative and not complete report of the engineers the tentative report on which the senate adopted it for a 9foot project did not give the estimate of cost but the engineers had not completed their studies they recommended that all dams and locks that were being installed under the old 6foot project be installed upon the basis of a 9foot project so that if congress should thereafter change it to a 9foot project it would save many millions of dollars in expense and these dams would not then have to be changed and modified at a tremendous cost the senate however adopted it outright as a 9foot project not knowing what the cost would be they simply put in a provision in order to get around mr coolidge trying to hold down costs calling for only seven and onehalf million dollars in appropriations there was 6 770 000 left over from the old 6foot project which made a total of 13 770 000 authorized by that act that money has been expended the congress has not authorized the balance required to complete though they have adopted the project at whatever cost it might involve the public works administration has allotted 76 495 000 for the building of the locks and dams this work has progressed for the last 2 years and many of them are nearly completed i have no report as to what their present condition is however that work has been going on under the national industrial recovery act for the past 2 years and they are going to complete it regardless of the passage of this river and harbor bill the senate put that in as one of the amendments here which the house conferees agreed
