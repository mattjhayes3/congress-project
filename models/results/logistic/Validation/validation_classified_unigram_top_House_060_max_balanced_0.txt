part to undertake to tell the older members what sort of legislation we ought to enact but when i consider the interests that the constituency which i represent have in the legislation that is being and ought to be considered by this house i will certainly be excused for inflicting myself upon you for a brief time we have during the general debate at this session heard considerable discussion with reference to the presidents message some criticising and some eulogizing i may perhaps during the course of my remarks either criticise or eulogize the president of the united states i shall agree with him where in my judgment he agrees with me some of the doctrines which he promulgates in his message and especially the second message are the doctrines that i have been taught from my boyhood and understand to be the doctrines of genuine democracy there is no question but that at this time our country is in sore distress for some cause or other out in my part of this great country along last fall when the people were exceedingly prosperous when the granaries were full and prices were good and the bank deposits were exceedingly large they went to bed on saturday night feeling happy and awakened monday morning with the banks of my state in many places practically closed and they were unable to withdraw their own money that they had deposited in them they at once asked the question and the people of this country are asking the question today what is wrong many remedies are suggested to relieve this condition of affairs among others we have been told upon the floor of this house we have been told throughout the length and breadth of this country that we are much in need of an elastic currency of more currency but when we contemplate the conditions that in my judgment brought about the panic which is now upon this country we need less elasticity in the consciences of the high financiers of the country rather than elasticity in our currency whether i am agreeing with the president or he with me i contend that one of the first remedies that ought to be applied is that so far as the national government has the power it ought to prevent stock gambling watering of stock and the illegitimate conditions which exist in the great money centers of this country that are withdrawing from the legitimate business of the country the money that ought to be engaged in taking care of the products of the land i contend that if this sort of legislation were placed upon our statute books so far as we have the power to place it there and the doors of these institutions that are but little less than gambling houses were closed the capital which seeks investment there would seek investment in the honest business enterprises of the country and it is a question whether under such conditions we have not a sufficient anount of currency to carry on the legitimate business of the country you can not preventcapital from seeking legitimate investmnint if you will close the doors of the houses of gambling and speculation capital is greedy and if there is an opportunity presented whereby it thinks it may obtain 100 per cent profit it will pass by the legitimate enterprise where there is only a promise of 5 or 10 per cent profit and take its chances in the speculative or gambling institutions but if you will close them if it is possible for it to be done by national legislation that capital which seeks investment in those institutions will at once seek investment in the legitimate enterprises of the country i hope that the prophecy made by my colleague from iowa upon the floor of the house a few days ago will come true and that before this session closes there will be measures brought upon the floor and passed by this house proceeding as far as possible to the protection of the people from the gambling and speculative institutions of the country i contend that it is not paternalistic legislation it is only legislation that throws a protection around the party who by his labor and his intelligence produces the wealth of the country the industrious citizenship of the united states is not asking for any paternal legislation the people are not asking for legislation that will put a dollar in their pocket that is not placed there by the production of their hands because they know as all of us know that there is only one way of legislating a dollar in any mans pocket and that is by legislating it out of another mans pocket they are not asking for such legislation they are only asking for such legislation as will protect the wealth of this country in the hands of the industrious and intelligent individual who produces it and prevents its being diverted from its legitimate channels by the socalled captains of industry of this country i stand here as measure whether it comes from that side of the chamber or a democrat but it makes no difference to me who proposes the from this i as a representative of my constituents will heartily support measures that i believe will bring about this result we have heard considerable upon the floor of this house and all over the country with reference to the power of the corporations trusts and combinations and how they have imposed upon the rights of the people legislation has been proposed by the introduction of bills by members on both sides of this chamber looking toward the protection of the people from the impositions of these great trusts and combinations the president of the united states has sent two messages to this congress concerning some of these questions and i desire now to read from the first message delivered to this house upon the question of tariff legislation i read from his message as follows speaking of the revision of the tariff the question should be approached purely from a business standpoint both the time and the manner of the change being such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbance in the business world and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives the sole consideration should be that the sum total of changes represents the public good this means that the subject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election because as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good in my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such election that is the statement from this message and it is conceded by gentlemen upon the other side of this chamber that tariff reform is needed at this time it is advised that we must revise the tariff yet we are told that it is unwise to do so preceding a presidential election i call attention again to the second message of the president of the united states which was sent to this house at a time when the financial conditions in this country were in a turmoil sent to this house at a time if there ever was a time when men should be conservative and not attack the financial interests of the country when these great financial institutions were trembling to the very foundationthe president of the united states sends a message to this house impressing upon us the importance of some legislation that he considers it necessary in order to prevent the malefactors as he terms them from robbing the people i say here whether it be a eulogy upon the president or not when he wrote this last message to this house i believe he did right in calling our attention to the financial conditions of the country and in calling our attention to thedishonesty in some of the places of high finance but the reason i have called your attention at this time to the two messages is to now say to you that if the president was right and logical when he wrote the last message attacking some of the great business interests and i contend he was then it is utterly impossible for him to have been logical when he wrote the first message to congress and said that we should not revise the tariff at this session there was much more reason for not sending the last message upon the logic that he gives for putting off the revision of the tariff until after election in the first message the tariff ought to be revised and i believe we all publicly concede thtt it ought to be revised i do not think there is any member of this house upon either side of the chamber who contends publicly that the tariff ought not to be revised even the gentleman from new york a few days ago said to us upon the floor of this house that the next republican platform would declare for a revision of the tariff why revise it revise it because under and by reason of the present schedules of the dingley tariff law the corporations and trusts of this country are permitted to extort from the people more than they should of the production of honesty industry and intelligence and as long as it is only attacking them why not revise it at this time what business will it interfere with no other business in the world except the business of robbing the people then why put it off until after the presidential election not only we upon this side of the chamber are contending that by reason of the present schedules the people are being robbed annually but i have here and will read to you from a newspaper clipping what a gentleman said who was in the city of washington a few days ago trying to get a measure through this house for the appointment of a tariff commission and i give you his figures this gentleman was mr van cleave president of the national association of manufacturers he says from onehalf to twothirds of the stuff made under this tariff bears to the consumer an unjust and unreasonable price because of the tariff it is estimated by competent authorities that the graft overcharge and wrong done the american public because of the present tariff reaches 38000 000 a working day we have the facts schedule by schedule and are prepared to make the details public should we receive opposition to our demand for a permanent tariff commission through the appointment of which a proper adjustment of the tariff can be procured we are not agitators or reformers we are mostly republicans and all protectionists if the statement made by this eminent gentleman is true then by reason of the present duties of the dingley tariff law the people of this country the consumers if you pleasethe common people who use the articles that are manufactured by these trusts and combinations and sold to them under trust and combination pricesare annually paying 900 000 000 more than they ought to pay why not revise that now why permit these trusts and corporations to have this 900 000 000 a year of the peoples money until after the next presidential election yes they tell us that there will be a plank in the republican party platform for a revision of the tariff it is not stated whether that revision will be up or whether it will be down we do not know anything about it there have been measures introduced upon the republican side of this house at this session of congress placing certain articles upon the free list among them petroleum wire lumber and so forth we do not anticipate a report of any bills by the ways and means committee that were introduced by democrats but if you will report out of the committee the bill introduced by the gentleman from wisconsin putting petroleum on the free list we will all vote for it it is right why not do it the president in his second message refers to the standard oil company as one of the great malefactors we find that a fine of 29 000 000 was assessed against the standard oil company which has not been paid but there is an opportunity for us the representatives of the people the servants of 80 000 000 people to inflict a fine upon the standard oil company which will amount to something and one which the manipulators of the standard oil trust can not by a simple twist of the wrist compel the people of the country to pay and which we may do by placing petroleum upon the free list as called for in the bill of the gentleman from wisconsin why not do it if we are after the standard oil company let us not content ourselves by fining them for violation of the laws of the land but let us say to them you have violated the laws of this country you have imposed upoa the people and we will take away from you the protection afforded you under the dingley tariff law let us not be content with compelling them to pay a fine but compel them to leave millions of dollars of money in the hands of the poor people who have to use their products other measures have been introduced at this session looking toward tariff revision no member will arise upon the floor of this house and proclaim that some of the measures introduced by gentlemen upon that side of the chamber are not just the only contention being that they should be postponed until after the next election i ask that this house this session of this congress pass some of these measures that will in some way show the good faith of the powers who control this house i want some members who think as has been stated that the convention which meets at chicago is going to place in its platform a tariffrevision plank to do something to show the good faith of that plank i want some earnest money pass some of these bills introduced by gentlemen on the other side of the chamber in order that we may have something by which we can avoid the statute 6f fraud after the next presidential electi6h let me sha to my friends on the other side of the chamber that you can not go before the people of this country at another election and rely upon the fact that you have introduced measuies in this house tending to tariff revision under the conditions that now exist it is true that you have introduced bills to place petroleum and other articles on thd free list aid you can go back to your constituents and say to them why i introduced this measure that shows we are in favor of tariff revision the bill died in the committee consequently we could not get it passed but let me say to you and say it in all candor before a single one of these measures was introduced you had voluntarily and of your own will placed it absolutely beyond your power to have them considered you tied your hands securely by the adoption of the present rules of the house and in selecting your speaker under the conditions that exist you have done to illustrate the same as the man who went out to fight his adversary and before entering the ring had his hands tied behind him he voluntarily and of his own will secured a referee to referee the fight who he knew did not want his adversary touched that is the condition that prevailed when you introduced these measures therefore i contend that now is the time because of the necessity that these schedules ought to be revised and we ought now and we have the time at this session to take up these matters look into them and do something to protect the people from the enormous amount of money that is annually being paid as the figures have been shown to you that we are paying in excess of what we should to these corporations these great corporations may submit to legislation that will only trim off the rough edges but when you come to lay the ax at the root of the tree when you come to strike at the evil to strike at the thing that enables them to control the markets of this country you will find them all standing together therefore i contend as a representative of my constituents that the thing we ought first to do is to strike at the very root of the power of the trusts of this country and take away the power to drive out competition i have heard it asserted upon the floor of the house that the duty upon a certain article was too insignificant to afford the trust or combination power to raise the price to the place where they are maintaining it i desire to give you my idea of how they do this with this sort of a tariff to illustrate i live in the state of iowa my friend here lives in the state of minnesota just across the line he is manufacturing an article that he can sell in the state of iowa for 10 i am manufacturing the same article in the state of iowa i secure an act of the legislature of my state conceding they have the power to pass such a law placing a duty of 2 upon that article i place it upon the market at 11 50 my friend from minnesota has to leave the state of iowa because lie can no longer compete with me after he has gone back home and sought other markets i raise the price of my article to 15 18 or 20 why you say it is not the tariff that permitted that rise in price why because the price has gone up so much higher than the original price of the article and the duty added the reason is my competitor knows that the minute he comes back to the state of iowa if he knows enough to transact business i can put it down again to where he can not compete with me that settles it i by combination afid trust methods control the market within my state limits and i can sell the article at any price consumption will stand that is the way the tariff works for the trusts and combinations of this country that is why it ought to be reduced and save the people annually according to the figures i have given you from the statement of mr van cleave 900 000 000 an amount sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government for one year the people are not opposed to paying any tax that may be necessary for the support of the government economically administered their patriotism will lead them to make any sacrifice that is necessary to support the government the only thing they complain of is that under the guise of supporting the government you have made the schedules so high that these corporations are permitted to take from them more for the domestic article than they should by rights receive therefore i repeat it again let some of these measures come out of the committee on ways and means let them be passed and show to the people of this country our good faith and i want to say to my friends upon the republican side of the house that with all of the abuse that you are heaping daily upon the head of john d rockefeller you have fooled the people for a long time in making them believe that there is no duty upon petroleum but when the intelligent people of this country thoroughly understand the condition of this matter i say that you will be held responsible for not passing the bill introduced by the gentleman from wisconsin or some other measure of that kind and you can not avoid it you can not take consolation from the old maxim we must all hang together or we will hang separately but i want to say to you that the american people are aroused not like a mob not like a rabble but an intelligent people moving steadily forward and they are not going to be disappointed any more you will have to suffer the consequences of the new maxim either separate or you will all hang together i desire again to call attention to the last message of the president of the united states and i do hope that some of the things he has advocated in that message may become a law at this session i should like to have an opportunity of sitting in my seat in this house and voting for them and again if the facts are true as stated by the president in his last message it is the most scathing indictment that was ever written against the statesmanship of this country for the last twentyfive years if conditions exist as is there claimed and i admit they do who is responsible why is it that the malefactors and the high financiers of this country have been permitted to impose on the innocent citizenship of the nation who has had charge and control of every branch of the governmentlegislative judicial and executivepractically for the last forty years it is that statesmanship i care not of what political party that is responsible for the conditions of which the president of the united states speaks i say that if it is not true it is the duty of every man who is a member of this house to rise in his place and declare it to be untrue and to oppose the president of the united states upon these propositions the indictment is written and you must either plead guilty to it or you must fight back there is no defense except to show that the allegations of this message are untrue we ask you today what are you going to do about it are you going to admit that the party that has had control of this government for the last twentyfive years has been derelict in its duty and has failed properly to care for the interests of the people you can not plead ignorance because from one end of this land to the other the democratic party has been telling you for these many years that just such a condition as now exists would come to pass unless there was some legislation to prevent it while this corruption that is now complained of was attaining the stage that it has reached while it was springing fron the fertile soil of industry and prosperity in this country you were told that unless certain legislation was placed upon the statute books it would finally become so powerfuland grow to such wonderful stature and would extend its branches and ramify to every part of the government and business interests of the country until it controlled them youdid not listen but you sat beneath its protecting shade and told the people of the country simply to have confidence in you and you would protect them it seems to me that when this second message was read which so thoroughly attacked the tree of corruption that has grown up and sheltered many statesmen of this country for the last twentyfive years some one certainly would have the gratitude to rise up and say woodman spare that tree touch not a single bough in youth it sheltered me and ill protect it now the people of this country are intelligent the patriotic american citizen has come to the condition where he thinks where he reasons and there is no other logical conclusion to be arrived at except to hold responsible for the conditions that now exist the party that has been in control of the affairs of the nation and to demand that that party surrender control you contend that some legislation has been enacted which is beneficial to the people of the country you cite us to the rate bill and several other measures we concede that some measures have been passed which are beneficial to the people and that perhaps ethers may be passed at this session of congress but renember there has not been a measure along the line of reform passed by this house or the last house and there will not be a measure passed by this house that has not been wrung from you by compulsion from the white house and you had as well say to me that you can conduct a religious crusade with men who have been compelled to confess their christ at the muzzle of a gun as to conduct a political reform by the men who are compelled to pass legislation because they are afraid of losing their oflice there are a host of statesmen in this country who for twentyfive years have been preaching the doctrine of the presidents message they are honest they are not spasmodic they have preached it because they believe it is right they are determined to carry this measure to the line of absolute justice and the people are not going to longer trust it in the hands of those who have either been incompetent or negligent as to the interests of the people they are determined to have men without entangling alliances or former condition of servitude no one can logically maintain that if the conditions exist which the president in his message says do exist they could exist without incompetent statesmanship or negligent statesmanship which permitted them to reach the point they now occupy these are facts which you must meet these are facts upon which the people want clear declarations they are not longer content with the proposition that after the next presidential election we will revise the tariff some one is going to be fooled about that plank in the platform i do not know who that fellow is they are going to say we are in favor of revising the tariff but we do not know whether it is the fellow who wants it revised up or the one who wants it revised down that is going to be satisfied when the revision comes and i say with all candor that i do not believe that the profession in that platform that they intend to revise the tariff is an honest profession i believe they want to deceive somebody or else they would revise it before election they want to say to some fellow over here who wants the schedules raised why we have not said which way we will go we will prhbably put your commodity up and then in the state of iowa where the people want a revision they will say we are going to revise the tariff as soon as the presidential election is over the people can not the president claims in his message be cool and deliberate just before presidential elections le claims they can be cool and be deliberate enough to enact legislation affecting the most critical financial condition that ever existed in the country but not to revise the tariff i maintain that he is right in the fjrst instance and therefore as a matter of fact wrong in the last but the people are going to demand something to show them that they may be satisfied that they may know that when the tariff is revised it is going to be revised in the interest of the consumers of this country onceat least and that is what we desire it does not make much difference what you place in the platform either at chicago or at denver the people have awakened they have not lost confidence no it is not the lack of confidence on the part of the people but the people have come into an actual knowledge of conditions they are determined to remedy them their platform is made and they are going to stand upon that platform and it is sufficient by which to measure every principle or every problem for solution in this country today it is the democracy of jefferson equal justice to all men and special privileges to none the republicanism of lincoln a government of the people by the people and for the people"], [0.024395346641540527, 0.9756046533584595, 1, "i understand the gentleman then to say briefly that they are neither fish flesh nor fowl mr 1iouston well sir it is right hard to tell what they are they teach conservatism but as a matter of fact they are the most radical men we have in all this country i call a man who can favor the protective system of today and stand by it a radical if i know what radicalism means it is noticeable that those who use these terms so much denominate themselves conservatives this is a case that truly illustrates the wolf in sheeps clothing they favor a protective system that levies tribute upon the many for the benefit of the few and to perpetuate that system they preach conservatism which is but a pretext to delay and to prevent ai reduction of the tariff or the correction of other evils upon which they thrive they realize the complaint coming up from every quarter of this land asking for a reduction of the tariff duties and the righting of other great wrongs they can not meet this demand by argument or reason to show it is not just in fact they confess a need for revision but in order to delay revision they become eloquent in their plea for conservative action in this line for the pretended fear that radical action would distract business interests the man or the party that advocates the golden rulethat it is right to do unto others as you would be done by is to them a radical a man that favors the enactment of law to regulate and control public carriers by just rules is an extremist and threatens to destroy the commerce of the country the man that would prosecute a corporation and men for crimes worse than robbery is a dangerous man to be clothed with official power and a president that gives countenance and support to the investigation and correction of wrongs and violations of law if the wrongdoer is a corporatioi or has money enough to affect wall street then such a president is a menace to the country to these men an earnest patriot is an old fogy an officer that will discharge his duty without fear or favor is a dangerous member of the public service an allusion to the declaration of independence indicates an agitator the advocate of equal and exact justice is a disturber of the peace and a reformer is an anarchist really these representatives of special interests are unhappy not from fear of the bogies they raise up to frighten and mislead the unwary but for fear that the people are awake to their misdoings and their reign of extortion is coming to an end one thing that adds to their grief is the fact that they are the very men that furnished the corruption fund and the boodle that paid the expenses of the campaign in which the president was elected they nurtured and sustained him they placed him where he is and nowkeen are their pangs but keener far to feel they nursed the pinion that impelled the steel the worst radicalism that this country has known is that pursued by the high protectionists and by the trusts that have grown up under this class legislation when a republican tariff commission of 188283 recommended a reduction of tariff duties of 25 per cent and no reduction was made but a higher rate followed that resulted in 1897 in the dingley bill this was radicalism in the extreme and when combinations are formed that are able to set aside the laws of supply and demand and fix their own price for an article or product this is radicalism run riot those who represent a class whether it be capital or labor may be dangerous in their radicalism but those who advocate the interests of the whole people and are seeking to right wrongs affecting the whole country are not the radicals that we have cause to fear the public is aroused republicans and democrats alike are seeking to cleanse the conditions and this has resulted in prosecuting some of the criminals who have committed the gravest crimes but the cry is heard let us be conservative and go slow these would stop the enforcement of the law upon the plea that it would disturb business conditions if you prosecute crime and enforce the law this system of reasoning is consistent with that system that favors the method of creating wealth by levying tribute and the theory of making the country rich by the exercise of the taxing power the crimes committed by those upheld by the fostering care of the government have shocked the sense of the nation they have caused inquiry they have created a demand that methods be changed crimes punished and the law enforced in response to this demand the president has taken action to enforce the law and to punish the malefactors in some instances and to the extent that he has done this he has done well and he has responded to the call of the conscience of the nation in so doing he has accepted doctrines and taken precepts from democratic authority and should be commended by all men of all parties to the extent that he has put these principles into execution he is to be condemned because he has failed to do all that should have been done in this direction it is a strange spectacle for a great political party to be so entwined with depre dators that a proposition to punish crime and enforce the law against these evil doers should bring consternation and dismay to the leaders of that party but such seems to be the state of affairs when the president began to prosecute criminals to correct wrongs that have grown up under the legislation of the republican party and the fostering influence of protection it caused such a shock that it convulsed the republican party if not the nation all honor to the president for the lessons he has learned and for the courage he has shown in somie instances in putting them into execution there are some distinguished republicans standing by him but those others who have made tardy motion to follow after the president will i fear need the prayers of all the saints to give them the grace and the courage to follow in his lead the trembling soul that halts and faints etc they are trying to assume an air of righteousness they are whistling to keep their courage up they have all of a sudden grown to approve the policies outlined in the presidents late message they stand upon the floor of the iouse and say we endorse them yet i call attention to the fact that the presidents first message lay upon the table for two long months without any fervid encomiums from republican orators they were as silent as the tomb of the capulets but when the second came it got too hot for them the light seemed to break in upon their benighted vision it was a most remarkable spectacle presented in this ilouse when this message was read and i wish the american people could have seen that spectacle just as it occurred when the clerk read the sound utterances of that paper they met a responsive chord in the hearts of the democrats on this floor they began to applaud it but several rounds of applause had been given by them before the republicans could adjust themselves to the embarrassing situation of approving sound doctrine as its reading progressed their embarrassment increased because its notes grew clearer the usually beaming and florid face of their distinguished leader was sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought they looked like orphans out in the cold but with what grace they could muster they began to fall in after the lead of the doughty champion from iowa they began with faint approval until finally they brought themselves to loud applause which was reenforced by the same champion in his speech a day or two later in which he bore testimony by word of mouth that the republicans were behind the president and would stand by his message i am afraid you will stand a long ways behind him but that party is shifty if not graceful they can trim their sails to meet an adverse wind but they have got an elephant on their hands oh if they could only turn him loose they are like the boy yoked with the calfthey want somebody to head us democracy has furnished the sound doctrines and if the president has profited thereby it is well for the country and we do not abandon them because he has subscribed to them now president lincoln once said i must stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong now we naturally feel a great pride in the party of jefferson and jackson and we would love to see honor to whom honor is due but far above this sentiment is our desire to see our countrys best interests subserved and we welcome the champion of these principles although he comes from the ranks of that party that has eschewed these doctrines in the past in all frankness we give approval and applause to those utterances of the president that in such vigorous terms advocate the cause of the people against these combinations that have sprung up under the fostering care of republicanism we will stand by our colors and welcome the volunteer service that comes from any and every quarter for the doctrines that we believe are just and for principles that we believe are everlasting but this same ingenuity that has so subtly promoted the interests of the classes is active now in originating devices and doctrines to perpetuate their power and continue their reign of depredation they use the words safe and sane conservatism and due regard for business interests with so much dignity and earnestness that one unacquainted with the facts and the knowledge of the source from whence these expressions come would think that the wise patriotic and soberminded part of our people were about to be the victims of an upheaval caused by cranks and fanatics but when we realize as every thoughtful man must that much of this cry of danger comes from those who are fattening upon the abuse of governmental powers and that they are now attempting to disarm the honest reformer by this cry of radicalism then we know that the chief danger lies not in the socalled radicals but in the miscalled conservatives when twelve years ago w j bryan began to call attention to the wrongs and dangers of the great monopolies and combinations then looming up in this country he was denounced as a socialist and an anarchist but he has been steadfast in his arraignment of these wrongs until today he is indorsed and supported by the american people democrats and republicans alike approve his advocacy of honest methods and fair dealing many who are now appropriating some of these doctrines as their own were a few short years ago denouncing them as demagogy and socialism notwithstanding this we must still remember that the vilest sinner may return and we welcome them with that charity that will cover a multitude of sins if they will but repent and turn from the error of their way but it is said by some of these conservatives whom the distinguished gentleman from nebraska has so properly denominated assistant republicans that democrats are too loud in their applause of the president they are pathetic in their solicitude for fear mr bryan has been too outspoken in his commendation of the presidents late message they are afraid these words of approval will come back to discomfort and annoy us in the coming campaign some of these are the same that have time and again been so uneasy for fear mr bryan had expressed his views to such an extent that it would injure him so afraid that he had been indiscreet they have been so deeply concerned so solicitous about his welfare they have made known to all the world their grave apprehension and deep regret i trust such things will deceive the american people no longer i want to say here and to emphasize the statement that i do not include in this class all of those who are advocating conservatism at the present time for in this class are many earnest and patriotic democrats who sincerely fear extreme action may be taken they have heard the murmur of complaint and they are afraid the remedies will be too drastic i think these fears are groundless to my mind there is much more danger of hesitation and failure to fully correct these evils and i desire to say further that i do not favor such action as would fail to fully recognize the rights of all men rich or poor of corporations or of individuals nor does the democratic party favor any such doctrine but i am for that radicalism if you call it such that will take positive action and will not compromise or temporize with extortion or crime i have no fear of that radicalism that demands in behalf of the people simple justice and no more i very much distrust a conservatism that would be content with less mr bryan was right when he commended certain parts of the presidents message much of it was sound some of it was utterly wrong when the republican party being in power and able to act was standing still and doing nothing under the conditions that exist today there was need for a message a call to action to duty they have had that call and they feel the force of it and of the circumstances that made itnecessary it is a rebuke that in their inmost hearts they feel no matter how serene they may appear nor with what sangfroid they may seek to hide their chagrin they now say that the republican party is behind the president and that message they were mighty slow to fall into ranks and they do not impress one now with the appearance of a charging column rushing shoulder to shoulder in support of their leader we do not see evidences of that swelling of the heart etc i vish that the conviction of the president to sound doctrine was more thorough he has shown some noble impulses but he has been unable to shake off that body of death of republicanism it would seem that a spirit like his would scorn the system that gathers spoils from the foul foray of protectionism especially in view of his past utterances on that subject he seems a warrior tried he can boldly speak and fairly ride but the president of a great nation that can support or tolerate the system of taxation that produces and promotes the very evils that he so loudly condemns and advise a postponement of their correction is still notwithstanding his bold and fervent speech politically in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity i would speak in no disrespect of the president but would show the deference and regard due to him and to his exalted position there are many things about him to admire i grant him brae but wild as bracklins thundering wave many noble impulses seem to spring from his strong mind but sometimes it is as the garden of the sluggard in which the vile and filthy weeds spring up to choke out the fair and wholesome blossom wildly while his virtues gleam they make his errors darker seem and flash along his spirit high like lightning oer the midnight sky he is a striking example of the imperfections of human nature he is a mixture of strength and weakness he illustrates that mankind is unco weak and little to be trusted paul morton was too close to him for the balance to be rightly adjusted and many other wrongdoers have not received at his hands the punishment they deserved his administration is a mixture of good and bad policies i wish the good were not so few i wish the bad were fewer the democrats are ready to cooperate with the president and to enact legislation to carry out many of the suggestions made in his message we challenge you on the other side to make good your assertion that you will support the president in his message the leader of the democrats has pointed out with clearness the issues recommended by him that we will stand by you in enacting into law we are ready to join hands how can you if you are sincere refuse to come to the mark and here now before this congress adjourns pass the laws that you say you favor and that the country so much needs the country will want an answer to this question there are many evidences of improvement the skies look brighter and the way seems clear a few days ago senator bevenige in speaking of present conditions said this period will be called in history the renaissance of american conscience the tricks of politics no longer deceive the people it will not do in these days to talk about any human brotherhood it will not do to denounce our political opponents you can not take the peoples mind in that way from the burning questions of the day the old and disgraceful political devices can no longer win elections a ticket nominated by money or intrigue now means certain defeat at the polls let us hope that this is true and it augurs well for the truth of the statement that it comes from a prominent man in that party that has thrived by the use of the very means he so lustily condens it seems from the signs of the times that this year democracy is to be at the full tide and that success awaits us in november the party has had of late many counsels sweet and many lengthened sage advices as to whom we should nominate for president but that question is already answered the choice is already made the great democratic heart of this country throbs with but one emotion on this point instinctively and naturally it turns to that man who has fought its battles for the last dozen years and who has never swerved from the helm when the tide swelled high who in the unequal contest against the republican party entrenched in position power and wealth and crippled and wounded by members of his own party has still in defeat never faltered but steadfastly stood for the rights of his fellowmen those who have fattened upon the power and advantage given by unjust laws have used every argument that ingenuity could devise or cunning invent to compass his defeat then as they are doing now when they can find no reason why by reason of his character his fidelity and his ability he should not be chosen as nominee then they resort to the sordid argument that lie can not win thus they would tempt us to sacrifice the cause of right and justice for a base barter for votesto sell the birthright of democracy for the spoils of office for a place at the pie counter it is pleasing to win laurels to gain victories it is good to succeed but it is better to stand for the right to be faithful and true again abraham lincoln said i am not bound to win but i am bound to be true i am not bound to succeed but i am bound to live up to the light i have this argument of anything to win is offered by those of this commercial age who would tempt us to surrender all for place and power they tell us that ie is battered over with defeat and is unfit for leader when did it come to pass that the scars of noble battle are a badge of discredit when the time shall come that the fact of a lost campaign is a reason to mark a man or a cause as unworthy then shall democracy be compelled to lower its colors then and not till then will she close her bright eye and curb her high career because of the defeats she has sustained in the past but sir i stand for a different doctrine i believe that no question is ever settled until it is settled right thattruth crushed to earth shall rise again thatfreedoms battle once begun though baffled oft is ever won and while our leader is not infallible and has uttered views on some subjects that we may not agree with yet today he is in harmony with his party on every material issue his candor in expressing his views on public questions commends him to the confidence of those who may not agree with him on all subjects it is a testimonial to his courage and honesty that he does not refuse to express his honest convictions on questions affecting the welfare of the country absolutely candid has he been with the american people he has bared himself to public scrutiny and discussed more freely public questions than any american statesman of the present or past he has not spared himself from critical dissection and after all this crucial experiefice he is less vulnerable and has committed fewer mistakes than most public men and today he stands out simple great and good the

requiring immediate relief and appealing to the senate and house to take to rcccss until rclicf shall be afforded every member of this louse i take it felt that there was imposed upon us a special responsibilitynot only a special responsibility but also that there existed an urgent demand for immediate relief on the highest patriotic grounds then mr dingley continued then we had a speech from mr crisp and then we had a few interruptions by the present speaker of the house and then mr wheeler gen joseph a wheeler made a speech then here comes my distinguished friend from new york mr paynej who lan de a speech of about a column then followed that bright industrious intellectual leader on the other side the gentleman from pennsylvania with his great power of coercion that comes from long service and erudition that enables him to succeed with whip and lash in driving measures along through the house the bill passed the house at once when i stood in this house seeing this same distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania bring in his resolttion a joint holiday resolution that came from the senate for this body to agree to and asked that unanimous consent be given that it he imnediately considered then mr chairmail i thought of this great partys record of industry christinas week in 1895 i wondered why we should adjourn this ilouse and all go hein a lot of us to the orange groves of florida a lot down to georgia a lot to new york of courseevery man permitted to go fishing with the scourged but not the treasury with an overflowing treasury of the united states meeting all the public demands at a time the people of the united states by a panic are shut out from their hard earnings and deposits in the banks under republican laws and yet you adjourn without taking up the currency or panic question without reporting the resolution which i introduced here on the first day of coligress for the speaker to aptpoint a committee of seven to investigate the cause of the pailic in wall street and elsewhere without doing anything to meet this emergency of the people i say when i look at the recent conduct of the republican party here in the sixtieth congress and then look back to its patriotic record in the fiftyfourth congress i stand amazed the american people stand amazed as does every man who has seriously and patriotically considered the great questions of the day and particularly this one that reaches down to the fireside of every man in this land whether he is poor or rich black or white old or young ah i read in the new york sun of sunday i believe that it was in the air down here and somewhat in the air up there in new york that a donothing programme had been agreed upon in congress that it was thick in the air that the american congress was not going to do anything to relieve the people of this panic is it so it looks mighty like it and here is the baldfaced fact that you are spending the whole day on a little old building that you know you are going to build on a little old bill that you know you are going to pass and that you know ought to be passed because the gentlenman who has it in charge says that they have not enough light in that building up there in philadelphia to examine the immigrants when they come in if the people in philadelphia need more light or if the surgeongeneral needs more light and if the republican party with the assistance of the democratic party on this side can get more light on the subject i am willing to vote for the bill although i am not in favor of unrestricted immigration now if the republican party is capable of legislating on this subject you ought to get at it if the republican party is not afraid of this rich mans panic it had better show that it has courage enough to grapple with this lion in its own lair and strangle it to death but instead of that here we met on the second day of december and now it is the 20th of january and not a blessed currency bill has been reported to this house nothing done to undo this panic ah some say you are waiting for the aldrich bill is that true is mr aldrich the american congress the republican party may admit that he is their ruler but i want them to understand that by the eternal mr aldrich is not the ruler of the democratic party nor of the patriotic american people he may be the cofatherinlaw and cograndfather of mr rockefeller dnd he may have in his pockets tobacco trust bonds and stocks and he may run with some of these men in new york who say they are democrats wolves in sheeps clothing but i want the gentleman to understand and those who are in alliance with him that by the eternal there is one party that he can not run and that there are a few of them left on this side that none of

rises very much above that it is a matter of moment to the people of the entire country and it is my purpose to see to it that the people of the country are not deceived by the gentleman from illinois now sir in answer to the gentleman from georgia last friday the gentleman from illinois said on the floor of this house that he was the author of the law to create the bureau of corporations that he originated the idea mauchi 23 that he claimed the credit for it and that it was one of the most laudable laws ever placed on the statute books by congress that is not entirely true and at the time i called his attention to the error and to the fact that i was the author of the law to create the bureau of corporations that i originated it and i said to him sitting in front of his desk that i would bet him a thousand dollars that i originated it and introduced the first bill to bring it about and that i would leave the question for settlement to the president le declined to take the bet and yet when i asked him for five minutes time to correct the error he had made he declined to give me five minutes although he controlled the time i then asked for unanimous consent to speak for five minutes in order to tell the truth about how this bureau of corporations originated and to my surprise the gentleman from illinois rose up on his hind heels and objected i did not think that was fair treatment and i told him so at the time during that day it was impossible for me to get time to speak on the matter but last saturday i secured time and i spoke on it and i quoted from the record telling the truth about the matter from its inception down to its final enactment into law and i think i demonstrated most conclusively to every member of this house that the gentleman from illinois did not originate the idea of this bureau of corporations that the gentleman from illinois was not the author of this law and that the gentleman from illinois had very little to do with it now i did not have very much time last saturday to go into this matter at length because the hour was growing late and i had been yielded only fifteen minutes at the conclusion of my speech i asked unanimous consent to extend my remarks by placing in the record as a part of my speech the previous record of congress of 1903 showing conclusively who was the author of this provision for the establishment of the bureau of corporations it is a matter of history it is a matter of record it is not only in the conogressional record of 1903 but it is in the book published by the government and known as the department of commerce and labor organization and law any member can get this book from the congressional library according to this record it appears conclusively that i introduced the first bill ever introduced in congress creating a department of commerce containing a provision to establish this bureau of corporations now sir the record of congress shows that i introduced that bill on the 2d day of may 1902 in the first sesslon ofthe fiftyseventh congress i appeared before the committee and other citizens appeared before the committee and argued in favor of my bill and especially in favor of creating this bureau of corporations the gentleman from illinois was a member of the committee and he heard the arguments and asked questions of me and of these gentlemen all of which is a matter of record the first session of the fiftyseventh congress adjourned nothing was done the bill was left pending in the committee on interstate and foreign commerce the second session of the fiftyseventh congress convened on the first monday of december 1902 and on the 12th day of december 1902 the gentleman from illinois introduced a bill for the establishment of a department of commerce and labor and in that bill he had one little provision for the establishment of a bureau of corporations but it was absolutely impotent so far as any power was concerned and practically amounted to nothing i appeared before the committee again and suggested the advisability of substituting my provision for the provision in the gentlemans bill however a bill was reported in january 1903 and as i said on saturday i thought the bill was reported by the gentleman from iowa the distinguished chairman of the committee but when i looked up the records i found the bill was reported at the request of the gentleman from iowa by the gentleman from illinois and i put that in the record giving the gentleman from illinois credit for that although i had not given him the credit for it in my speech on saturday that was honest on my part it shows how fair i wanted to be to the gentleman from illinois and how unfair the gentleman from illinois had been in the whole matter to me now when the bill came up in the house in the committee of the whole i offered as an amendment my provision for the establishment of this bureau of corporations and the question was debated the gentleman from illinois taking a leading part in the debate as the record shows finally it came to a vote in the committee of the whole the gentleman from illinois was a teller on his side he being against this bureau of corporations and i was a teller on my side being in favor of this bureau of corporations and the vote shows that the gentleman being in the majority had a few more votes than i had and the amendment went out in the committee of the whole every democrat voting for it and every republican voting against it then when the question came up in the house the leader of the minority mr richardson of tennessee at my suggestion and at the suggestion of other members on this side of the house offered my identical amendment for this bureau of corporations on a motion to recommit the bill with instructions to amend accordingly and on that motion the yeas and nays were demanded by myself and on the roll call the record shows that i was in favor of it and the gentleman from illinois voted against it and the record also shows that every republican in the house at the time voted against this burean of corporations and every democrat voted for it then the bill went over to the senate there was no debate on it in the senate it was referred in a perfunctory way to the committee and reported back from the committee and went to conference the conferees met and in that conference they adopted part of my provision and put it in the bill but i want to say that the best part of my provision for this bureau of corporations was not put in the bill and if it had been it would have been a very much better bill and it would have been a very much better bureau of corporations because my amendment providedand any member here who will read it will see for himself that this information when collated by these investigations of the criminal trusts of the country should be furnished to the congress as well as to the president of the united states that is the point i wanted to make the other day when this resolution of the gentleman from georgia was pending in this house and the gentleman from illinois shut me out and prevented me from doing so but there was a lot of other matter left out and finally they did agree in conference upon the establishment of a bureau of corporations and as it was agreed to it was reported by the conferees and printed in the record and if any member or anybody in this country will read that conference report and will read my original provision for the establishment of this bureau of corporations he will see that the conferees took out of my provision practically what is in the law today but did not take out enough to make the law what the law ought to be in order to get the data regarding violations of the law by the criminal trusts of our country so that the president could act so that the attorneygeneral could act so that congress could act in case additional legislation was needed now that is practically the story of the creation of this bureau of corporations and i submit to any impartial member of this house whether the gentleman from illinois was the author of the law whether he originated the idea or whether i originated the idea and i submit that question to the people of this country and if the gentleman wants additional information in regard to it i would commend him to the president of the united states who knows the truth about what the conferees were finally compelled to do after telegrams were sent to members of the senate saying no more antitrust legislation was wanted now i think it is an injustice to a member when he has unanimous consent to extend his remarks and in the extension tells the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth regarding a matter under consideration for a republican member who has been caught with the goods to come into the house and because he is in the majority get another republican member to offer a resolution to strike out of the record a democratic speech because the democratic speech tells the truth and the truth happens to hurt the republican party never since i have been a member of this house have i asked for recognition on the ground of personal privilege i have never asked for anything but my rights and i hardly get them but i say to you and i serve notice on the republicans that if they adopt this resolution to strike out of the rsceon a part of my speech they will hear more from me from now until the close of this congress do not be in a hurry my friends the republican party is the opportunist party of the country whenever a democrat or the democratic party originates anything that is good the republican party comes along a few years afterwards and seizes it and claims it as its own republicans have been doing that the republican party has been doing that for years and it is time that we democrats who have to take the republicans by the nape of the neck every now and then to compel them to respond to the demands of the people of the country should tell the truth about it and when we do get the republicans to respond and enact the legislation we originate that we initiate we do not intend that you shall steal the credit and claim the glory or get away with the goods i want to say to the gentleman from illinois that if there is anything in my speech in the record that refleets on him personally i will consent to strike it out if there is anything in my speech that is not strictly in accordance with the facts relating to the history of the legislation to create the bureau of corporations i will consent to strike it out but if you ruthlessly strike out a part of my speech by adopting the resolution just offered because you have the power and numbers to do so i will get it back in the record and i will get it back in the record in a way that will do the republicans more harm before the people of the country than does the present record as i said in the beginning i repeat now that i do not intend to allow this question to sink into a personal controversy between the gentleman from illinois and myself it rises above that this is a question which i have placed right before the people of the country and right before the members of this house i stand on the record i abide by the record and i say to the gentleman from illinois that he barks and gets bitten and then whines and i am surprised that the gentleman has appeared today in his mean little pettifogging way whining and squealingbecause he deceived the house and he deceived the country the other day when he said he originated the idea that he was the author of the law to create the bureau of corporations his claim was preposterous and ridiculous and nobody knew it better than the gentleman from illinois when he said it but he did it deliberately and when he was told he was deceiving the house he refused to give me permission to reply to correct the misstatement"], [0.04616749286651611, 0.9538325071334839, 1, "oh you need not

statement i knew some of them favored it but what does the minority of a committee amount to if the views of that minority even though correct can not be crystallized into a bill on the floor of the house by the majority that is the point as far back as 1897 the interstate commerce commission reported upon this gross abuse to the congress i quote from their report in 1897 these considerations of the necessity for reform in this regard the universal demand for a uniform classification the ten years of appeal to the carriers by the commission and by congress to adopt a consolidated and single system for the whole country the representations by the carriers themselves their former efforts to that end the energy at one time displayed by them and the apparent apathy that marks their attitude toward the subject today all lead the commission to the renewed recommendation that congress provide for such uniformity by prompt and appropriate legislation carriers subject to the act should be required within a specified time not longer than one year to prepare publish and file with the commission a uniform classification of freight as the basis of rates for the transportation of property in the united states and the commission should be authorized and directed upon investigation from time to time to make such amendments as may appear to be reasonable and necessary in case the railroads refuse or neglect within the time specified to comply with this direction the commission should be authorized and required to prepare such classification the adoption of which by all carriers subject to regulation shall be made compulsory by suitable penalty in view of the continued nonaction of the carriers and the action already had in congress it might be the wiser to pass the bill now pending in the senate so it seems that these commissioners of high character and understanding and skilled by long practice in the business of their office have in the interest of decency and of honorable dealing on the part of the railroads recommended time and again that the congress of the united states empower them to compel the railroad companies to make a uniform or proper classification of their rates and on failure on their part to do so that the commission itself be empowered to make such uniform classification of rates for the railroads and at the very time of the passage of the hepburn railroad rate bill by this house or very near that time a convention of state railway commissioners was held in this city members of each state railway commission in the united states or a great number of them met in this city to confer upon the question of needed national legislation upon the railroad problem and here is the resolution that that convention of state railway commissioners agreed upon and passed and directed their secretary to send a copy of to the senate and the house of representatives resolved that it is the sense of this convention that congress enact a law requiring the railroads engaged in interstate commerce throughout the united states to within two years after the passage of such act prepare and adopt a uniform classification of freight articles and in case they fail to do so within the time reeuired that the interstate commerce commission at once proceed to make such classification and when so made by such commission the same shall be the legal classification for interstate shipments that the secretary forward a copy of this report to the senate and house of representatives and call their attention to the former reports of this association on this subject and mark the language embraced in this resolution they not only instructed their secretary to forward their report to the senate and house of representatives but they further instructed him to call the attention of the senate and of the house of representatives to former reports of this association on this subject in the state of florida and at the head of its state railroad commission is the hon r hudson burr an exmember of the florida legislature who for years has been one of the state railroad commissioners i believe he has attended since his election to that office for years every annual convention of state railway commissioners his opinion is valuable upon this subject and i quote it here for the benefit of those who may read these remarks it was in a letter addressed to me about the time that the hepburn bill was pending in this house the letter is as follows and he writes about the hepburn rate bill i see that it gives no supervision whatever over the classification while this bill may prevent the railroads from raising or lowering a rate or freight tariff it will amount to very little if the railroads are to be the sole judges of classification for that has always been the favorite instrument in their hands for tampering with rates it is possible to change whole tariffs almost by use of the classification and it is done for instance the florida railroad commission when it first organized adopted what was known as southern classification no 25 as the florida classification in about two years time the southern classificalion had been changed until something like 500 articles in classification no 25 had been raised and at that time the railroad commission revised the florida classification placing back the articles thus raised by the railroads and adopted what was known as the florida classification no 1 and now we find that again each year when the traffic managers have met for the purpose of going over these matters they have raised items in the southern classification until it differs materially from our classification if they used the florida classification on interstate shipments into florida it would not affect us so badly but where the southern classification is higher they use it and if in a remote case an item should be higher in the florida classification they would use that in other words they use that which results in the highest rate it seems to me that it would be a farce to pass a bill enlarging the powers of the interstate commerce commission in which they were given the right where complaint is made of the unreasonableness of a rate and after hearing etc to substitute in lieu thereof a just and reasonable rate to leave the classification entirely in the hands of the railroad people the commission should have supervision of the classification to the same extent that they are given supervision over the rate that is where an article is classed in a manner to make it unreasonable and unjust that upon complaint investigation and hearing the commission should have the right if found to be as complained of to substitute in lieu thereof a reasonable and just classification of the article or articles complained of i offered an amendment to the hepburn railroadrate bill when it was pending in this body and before its passage two years ago and while it was still in the committee of the whole house to cure this evil the amendment being as follows on page 10 section 4 line 15 after the word regulations insert the words or classifications and after the word regulation in line 23 insert the words or classification and on page 11 line 5 after the word regulation insert the words or classification it was voted down by democrats and republicans alike this amendment wouid have invested the interstate commerce commission with the power over this very subject of classification and would have been a limit and a check upon the railroad companies of the country in their rateraising proclivities by the devious method of change of classification and now in regard to the latter of the amendments that i advocate namely that the interstate commerce commission shall have the power to make a physical valuation of the railroads of the country without this amendment being enacted into law the interstate commerce commission is powerless almost in legal conflicts with the railroads of the country to sustain themselves when the justness and reasonableness of their rates are called into question in the courts i had the honor to hold the office of attorneygeneral in my state for fourteen years in that long time i had many conflicts in the courts as attorneygeneral with the railroads in the state of florida these legal contentions grew out of resistanc6 on the part of the railroads in the state of florida to fhe rates rescribed by its state railroad commission wherever the railroads challenged the justness and reasonableness of the state commissions prescribed rate or rates their one plea that they relied upon was that the particular rate so prescribed by the state railroad commission or that the whole series of rates prescribed by the state railroad commission in effect were confiscatory and so diminished the profits of the company in operating its railroad as not to permit the company to make a reasonable profit upon its investment some of this litigation or at least litigation of a similar character is pending today in the courts in the state of florida one suit is between the pensacola and atlantic division of the louisville and nashville railroad and the state of florida through its state railroad commission to support the contention of the railroad company and to support its plea my information is that the company has placed in evidence in the litigation the entire physical cost and value of its railway lines within the state of florida that is my information ill other words the railroad has physically valued by its own selected engineers and officers its railroad depots terminals section houses its roadbed rails rights of way and every appurtenance to the railroad and placed this value in evidence in the pending lawsuit to show what its investment is and in this way raises the issue that the state commissions rate or rateg is or are confiscatory and will not permit a reasonable earning upon its investment and under the laws of florida the railroad commission have employed an engineer and will make in their own behalf their valuation of the physical property of this contending and litigating railroad so if a conflict should come as it will come in the courts of the united states on the part of the attorneygeneral of the united states and his assistants or of special counsel employed by the federal government to enforce any rate or series of rates prescribed by the interstate commerce commission for any railroad their first plea in such courts would be that their investment was so large and their physical property so great in value that such rate or rates in their operation would not permit the railroad company to earn a reasonable compensation upon its investment this kind of physical valuation is an essential part of the interstate commerce commissions power to sustain in court the justness and reasonableness of the rates they prescribe for the railroads unless they have this physical valuation of the properties of the railroad companies then when they are met by the pleas in the federal courts of the railroad attorneys and of the railroads that their rates are unjust and unreasonable and are confiscatory in their nature and in their effect the commission and its attorneys and the federal government will be powerless to sustain their contentions that their rates are just and reasonable it has been said by high authority that all men are liars certainly if there is an inclination in the human heart to falsify unfortunately there is no temptation so great to perjury as the love of money in the great contentions that will come between the federal government and the railroads over the enforcement of the rates prescribed by the interstate commerce commission there will be some mighty swearing on the part of some railway officials the temptation to sustain their unjust and unreasonable rates and to sustain and hold the millions of dollars that they get by operating unjust and unreasonable rates must necessarily lead to some false swearing in the courts upon the question of the valuation of railway properties and kindred questions a remarkable case of contradictory oaths as to railway value has occurred in the state of florida i give the facts which were furnished and read in the united states senate a few years ago and were embodied in the speech of one of its very able senators these facts were given to the senator by a lawyer in florida who i know is familiar with the railway litigation in that state as against the state railroad commission and who i believe has stated the facts with literal exactness i quote the letter of the florida lawyer to the united states senator which was read in part on the floor of the senate at that time to wit the florida railroad commission enforces its orders by mandamus instituted originally in the supreme court of the state and yet judge pardee has enjoined the florida railroad commission and all of the state officials from instituting suit in the supreme court of the state by mandamus to compel the louisville and nashville railroad company to reduce its passenger fare from 4 cents to 3 cents per mile in florida and this injunction was granted upon the affidavit of the vicepresident of the louisville and nashville railroad to the effect that the louisville and nashville property in florida is worth at least 5 200 000this high valuation being essential to their caseand the state produced an affidavit made by the same man one month and twentyeight days ior to his swearing to the bill in which affidavit he had sworn that the identical property was not worth exceeding 1 700 000 and yet in this mans affidavit the state was temporarily restrained from instituting mandamus proceedings in the supreme court of florida to enforce compliance with the rate here was a case where a vicepresident of the louisville and nashville railroad swore that for the purposes of taxation the property of that railroad in florida was worth 300 000 less than 2 000 000 in a short time afterwards this same vicepresident swore that this same identical property was worth 5 200 000 and this latter high valuation was essential to sustain the contention of the railroad in the courts upon this latter affidavit a facile federal judge restrained the state officials from instituting mandamus proceedings in its supreme court to enforce compliance with the prescribed rates of the state railroad commission and this scandalous case will be repeated a thousand times in the federal courts of this country when the attorneygeneral of the united states and his assistants and special federal counsel come in conflict with the interstate railroads to enforce the rates prescribed for them by the interstate commerce commission for the congress not to pass such an amendment as i here advocate is to leave their constituentsthe shippers the producers and the consumersbound hand and foot to the onerous executions of excessive railroad transportation charges suits are pending now in the federal courts contesting the rates prescribed by the interstate commerce commission and challenging the constitutionality of the legislation under which these rates are fixed and the pleas will be heard in every united states court where this litigation is pending by the railroad lawyers for their railroad clients that the rates prescribed by the interstate commerce commission are confiscatory in effect and deprive the railroad company of a fair remuneration upon their investment and the question will occur to the governments counsel what is the real bona fide value of the railroad investment and unless they are possessed of the means of fixing before the courtsof the land with exactness the real value of the physical property of the railroads they will be overwhelmed by the railroads with their bloated ballooned fraudulent valuations of their property the attorneygeneral of the united states able though he is and his assistants and special counsel however ingenious and learned they may be will be embarrassed and nonplussed and humiliated and defeated in the courts of the country unless they can go into those courts armed with the evidence of value of the railroads that should be placed in their hands by the congress of the united states the vast majority of 80 000 000 people will hold the congress of the united states to a vigorous accounting at least it should be done unless the congress of the united states will pass such legislation as will put the shippers of the country the producers and the consumers on a level in the courts with the railroads of the country when the people of the united states fully understand this question and thoroughly understand how defenseless they are at present in their conflicts with the railroads through their own legal agents in their own courts there will be an aroused a wrathful public sentiment the shock of which the congress must meet the railroads of the united states with their fourteen billions of apparent property with their multiplied resources in capable lawyers with their purchased newspaper press and with their attorneys and agents holding high govern mental positions are a great and a powerful force to contend against but there is a greater force than the railroad corporations and all their allied and sympathetic corporate interests the people of the united states intelligently aroused upon this great question are more powerful than the railroads and their allies in such a contest when it is fully on there can be but one end this legislation will finally be passed by the american congress when the people of the united states cease to look upon railroads as the private property of their owners when they learn and fully and completely understand the fact that the people of the united states and of the states can own every line of railroad by condemnation and purchase and take over from the railroads their property and make it the property of the people then this matter will be nearer settlement than it is now i am opposed to government ownership but i wonder sometimes whether this great railroad problem will ever be settled otherwise than by full government ownership or at least by the purchase in the leading lines of the country of a controlling interest by the state and national governments it is at least instructive upon this phase of the question to recall that most of the european nations own their railroads that japan in recent years by enormous national bond issues has taken over to itself nearly all of its lines of railroad that mexico wise in its generation anticipating some rheumatic visit of mr e h harriman has already purchased to forestall his hospitality a controlling government interest in its main lines of railway william j bryan has already publicly declared his opinion thatthis great problem will never be settled except by government ownership and thousands of intelligent men besides mr bryan looking with apprehension upon the great power of the railroads of the country and seeing how impossible almost it is for government attorneys and government boards to fully control and regulate them share the same opinion with mr bryan let me point out the vast power of the railroads of the country in their wealth and the vast power of a few men controlling this wealth in a speech i delivered on the floor of this house on february 8 1907 i used this language and made the following quotations the railway capitalization in the united states is something over 13 000 000 000 and the railway mileage in the united states is about 220 000 miles six groups of men own 164 000 miles out of this total mileage of 220 000 miles let me read the groups there is the vanderbilt group the pennsylvania group the morganhill group the gouldrockefeller group the harriman group the moore group and the santa fe out of this total mileage of 220 000 miles i repeat they own 164 000 miles and out of the total capitalization of over thirteen billions they own nine billions and more in 1898 mr hobson one of the greatest of english economists wrote in his evolution of modern capitalism the rapidity with which the whole railway system is passing into the hands of great monopolist syndicates with the necessary result of stifling competition is in some respects the most momentous economic movement in the united states at the present time moody on trusts an authoritative work upon that subject on page 491 declares as follows the standard influence is feltmeaning thereby the standard oil companyquite forcefully in all the railroad groups and this influence is showing a steady growth throughout the entire steam railroad field it is now freely predicted in wall street that the next decade will see the rockefeller interests the single dominating force in the world of railway finance and control in a book i have in my hand designated railways trusts and the people by prof frank parsons an authority upon these matters he states as follows on page 13 whatever may be the true number of our railroad kings it is beyond question that a very few men have power to control our railway rates and that still fewer will control them if the present processes of consolidation and combination continue the managers of six big systems control threefourths of the country and fivesixths of the traffic and indirectly dominate almost all the rest the six big groups are growing into one the railway empire looms huge and powerful out of the mists that shroud the future in the conclusion of the chapter devoted to the subject of the railway empire he uses this language the motives that impel men to build these giant combines by consolidation or coordination relate partly to the economies and transportation benefits of union and partly to the personal profit and power of those who control the combines the first motive and its consequences are in line with the public good in so far as combination eliminates the wastes of conflict and secures the benefits of harmonious cooperation in the railway service it is a gain to the community but in so far as it conduces to the financial ascendency of wall street and intensifies the commercial supremacy and industrial dominion of a few great capitalists it is a political industrial and social danger the railways united form a much more extensive interest than the government from an economic point of view already they outrank our state governments and dominate the political affairs of sovereign commonwealths and as a unit in the bands of a gigantic trust they might even overshadow and control the national government itself and out of this vast capitalization of over 13 000 000 000 and at present 227 000 miles of railroad there are high authorities in this country who hold that 50 per cent at least of this vast capitalization is an unparalleled fraud i quote the opinion of professor parsons a competent authority on this matter who testified before the industrial comlnission many years ago as follows the prevalence of water in the railroad system is so well known that it is not necessary to do more than touch upon the matter venderhilt set the pace in consolidatin the 11 roads between albany and buffalo and increased the capitalization by nearly 9 000 000 in doing it then added 50 per cent to the stock capitalization of the hudson road of which he was president then extending his control over the central and adopting the same tactics there he added 80 per cent to the new york central then he consolidated the two roads and in doing it inflated the central 27 per cent more and the hudson 85 per cent so that in the four years from 1866 to 1870 he brought the capitalization up from 54 000 000 which was a little more than the total cost on the books of the companyabout 4 000 000 moreto 103 000 000 the total cost on the books in 1870 was under 70 000 per mile while under his capitalization it was 122 000 per mile that example has been followed to a great extent all over the country so that our railroad capitalization is now about half water or water and wind the figures of construction and equipment cost given in poors manual from time to time indicate that the railroads of the united states are capitalized at about double what they could be built and equipped for at the present time the practices prevdlent at the time that professor parsons speaks of years ago have been practiced in more recent times not in one instance but in hundreds and in every case this fraudulent overcapitalization is charged up against the american producers consumers and shippers as a perpetual indebtedness hon joseph l bristow lately elected to be a united states senator from kansas addressed its legislature in a prepared speech in his speech he made the following statements e h harriman mortimer l schiff george j gould and james stillman acquired control of the alton railroad paying in round numbers it has been alleged 39 000 000 for 98 per cent of its stock it had an outstanding indebtedness of bonds end stocks amounting i am informed to 33 000 000 these men retained control of the property for about seven years during which this indebtedness was advanced by them from 33 000 000 to 114 000 000 making a net increase of about 81 000 000 of this gigantic sum there was expended in improvements and additions about 18 000 000 leaving an increase in the indebtedness of the railroad of more than 62 000 000 or more than 66 000 per mile for which the company received nothing whatever the proceeds from the sale of this 62 000 000 of increased indebtedness was appropriated to the personal use of the syndicate and the methods by which the property was loaded with this debt and its revenues looted is very interesting the laws of our country should regard the financial methods employed in the alton case as criminal and the men guilty of such highhanded operations should face imprisonment yet today these captaitis of high finance are making a determined effort to prevent the enactment of legislation that will take from them their opportunities for plunder and to do this they buy or subsidize newspapers employ able attorneys to look after their political interests and by false representation try to organize their employees into political associations that will be obedient to their demands they seek to destroy every man in public life who is not subservient to their wishes they are especially interested in the control of the united states senate and the federal judiciary probably more interested in the senate because through it they have frequently been able to control the selection of federal judges it is my purpose to use what talents i may have to bring about legislation that will establish the same rules of justice for these financial banditti that applies to the conduct of men in ordinary walks of life it should be just as easy to send a man to prison who loots a railroad of 10 000 000 or 50 000 000 as it is the man who burglarizes a bank or robs a postoffice it can not be doubted that as soon as the american people intelligently comprehend this railroad problem inrelation to them and their rights they will instruct in language not to be doubted their agents in the american congress to carry out their wishes i will introduce a bill embracing the three amendments that i have advocated and also the power to permit or prohibit future bond and stock issues of interstate railroads if the railroads are permitted to increase fraudulently at will their indebtedness then they can raise rates at will to pay interest on this indebtedness and that is exactly what the railroads are doing and have done this state of affairs makes the american people look stupid in that they daily permit it what has been the history briefly of railroad rate legislation on the part of the national government in 1886 the first legislation was had upon this subject in the congress of the united states the interstate commerce commission was created it was thought by the public and the commission themselves held that they possessed the ratemaking power in 1897 ten years afterwards the supreme court of the united states held that the interstate commerce commission did not have the ratemaking power this made the interstate commerce commission a mere shadow of what it thought it had been they became a board of highly respectable and highly respected public citizens with a title and without power were it not for their high character their high integrity and the respect in which they were held by good men they would have been the contempt and laughingstock of the country the railroads did laugh at them and held them in legal contempt because they were powerless to enforce a just and reasonable rate upon tho railroads the interstate commerce commission were then the laughingstock and the butt of jokes by the railroadowned press in the united states the congress of the united states if it did not treat them with contempt treated them with atbsolute and perfect indifference their annual reports were laid upon the desks of members of the congress they might have been opened they might possibly have been read but they were never heeded and in these reports from 1897 until 1905 they urged upon the congress of the united states the importance of giving to them the power to prescribe a just and reasonable rate on the complaint of the shipper this was the one and substantial power that they asked for but in addition to this in their annual reports for years they plead and almost begged of congress that they confer upon them other and subsidiary powers important in themselves that they might restrain the railroad companies and the private car lines from their vicious and unjust practices these reports might as well have been addressed to and laid at the feet of the egyptian sphinx congress was blind dumb and deaf i declared on the floor of this house three or four years ago in discussing the bills then pending before the house and discussing the presidents message that i did not believe that the house of representatives as then constituted would for many years to come have considered and passed any railroad rate legislation unless theodore roosevelt had thrown his message to the fiftyeighth congress recommending certain powers to be given to the interstate commerce commission upon the floor of the house of representatives like a bomb and compelled their attention to it that language was correct then i believe and i have never thought yet that i made any mistake in making it the president in his message to the fiftyeighth congress recommended four substantial powers to be given to the interstate commerce commission first that they should have the ratemaking power upon complaint of the shipper second that the terminal lines of the country should be put under the authority of law that their iniquitous impositions upon the traffic of the country might be corrected third recommendation was made that the private car lines owned by the packers trust in chicago the beef trust as it is popularly called be placed under the authority of law that their excessive icing charges might be remedied he further and fourthly recommended that railroads and steamships with connecting freight rates and not operated in common should be placed under the authority of law how did both political parties in this body meet that message the democratic caucus met shortly afterwards and its sole provision embodied in its caucus bill was the first recommendation of the president to the congress the republican caucus met shortly after that and its bill embodied the democratic recommendation plus some regulation of joint rates of railroads and further provided for a special court of the expediting of litigation growing out of this national legislation but neither political party in this body inthe fiftyeighth congress and following the presidents message put nearly so much of relief for the shippers of the country into their respective caucus bills as was embodied in his message by the president of the united states and the astounding spectacle was presented to the country that after the adjournment of the democratic caucus theodore roosevelt a republican president could go into every state represented by a democratic senator and into every district represented by a democratic member of this house and show to the producers and the consumers and shippers in those districts and in those states that he had recommended more to their benefit in his annual message than their democratic representatives had incorporated in their caucus bill i have heard it said by men in this country not a thousand miles removed from this capitol that roosevelt had bewitched the people of this country i am a democrat and that constitutes quite a number of differences with the president at once but undoubtedly his great reputation among his countrymen is grounded not in the bewitchment of the people but in their knowledge of the great services that he rendered to his countrymen in initiating his great contest for reform legislation with reference to the publicservice corporations and the fact that his recommendations at that time were far and beyond the acts of the two political parties in this body in railroad rate legislation accounts for his strength with those producers and with those consumers and with those shippers when will this further remedial legislation come on the part of congress against the interstate railroads of this country how long will it be there is one way in which it can come more quickly than in any other way the democratic minority in the senate of the united states and in this house of representatives can compel the enactment of this remedial legislation were they to meet in caucus tonight and adopt a full and complete remedial railroad rate bill it would be impossible for the republicans in the senate and in this house of representatives to long delay passing it it is the function of the minority to compel the majority to legislate beneficially when that majority is recusant and refuses to do so but what can be said of a minority that does not act what hope mr chairmanand i address my remarks particularly to my democratic colleagueswhat hope is there for democracy in this great country unless they can show to the people of the country that they are more entitled to come here to the senate and the house as a majority than are the republicans there is no reason or right in converting a minority into a majority unless the minority deserves such promotion it is undoubtedly true and i prophesy that the republicans in the congress unless stirred to action by the presidentelect william h taft will not enact further and real remedial railroad rate legislation in ten or perhaps twenty years what then will be the attitude of my party in congress upon this great question the last democratic national convention declared as follows upon this question"], [0.05424046516418457, 0.9457595348358154, 1, "i thank the gentleman very much for his complimentary reference but i desire to repeat what i attempted to say a few moments ago and that is that the republican panic had not affected us in the cottongrowing south up to this time as much as it had affected those in the great commercial centers of the east and of the west and of the northwest perhaps it certainly has not affected the honest farmers down in alabama as much as it has the gamblers and the rotten banks of new york city and i believe that the south today is in better condition and is the most inviting field in the country for investment on one occasion our amiable speaker accused me of being optimistic and he spread out his arms and said clayton you and the other optimists get out there and you talk about our glorious country now he sometimes indulges in that evidence of optimism himself but i want to say to the gentleman today that the farmers of the south hold 3 000 000 bales of cotton that cotton does not belong to wall street nobody has a mortgage on it it belongs to those people in the south and they have it in the south today the gentleman can realize that that cotton is worth from 250 000 000 to 300 000 000 the south is in better condition to hold that cotton than it ever was and we are going to hold it until the british spinners give us a reasonable price for it the gentleman may not have observed the trend of events particularly in the matter of cottonhe is more interested in beef and pork and hence he evinces always a lively interest whenever there is a pork barrel brought into the house but we have this enormous amount of cotton and the south today is indebted to the british spinners almost altogether for the maintenance of the present price of cotton during the last cotton year the south produced 13 600 000 bales of cotton before that cotton year had expired and in the face of the new crop cotton advanced to 13i cents a pound in the interior this year when we have a cotton crop of only about 11 500 000 bales cotton is quoted in new york i think today at about 10 45 cents or 10 50 cents now why is a cotton crop of 11 500 000 bales worth only 10 cents while a cotton crop of 13 500 000 bales was worth 13i cents i give this to the gentleman from illinois to think about and to help us to remedy the situation and i appeal to his party to remedy the situation as far as legislation may do it it is on account of a republican panic it is on account of your failure to enact proper laws it is on account of your failure to enact proper financial legislation to enact proper tariff laws to do something for the good and for the benefit of the country and you can not wonder why the cotton growers of the south continue and will continue to vote for the democratic ticket in the face of all of this republican inefficiency and i may say stupidity"], [0.05493038892745972, 0.9450696110725403, 1, "yes the largest in the history of the trade cotton has ceased to go to new york and surely it can not be contended that this exchange could render aid in marketing the crop when it is admitted by the exchange apologists that the cotton no longer goes there but some one may still claim that notwithstanding the fact that cotton no longer seeks new york as a market place the operation of the new york cotton exchange is still helpful to the producer in markoting his crop if so the question at once arises does it do so at the least expense or in the most economical manner for the seller and buyer we all know that there are 450 members of this exchange membership being limited to that number we all know that these gentleman are not running this exchange for their health and that first and last regardless of what else may be claimed or contended for this all must admit that the burden of the expense of this exchange ultimately falls on the producers and consumers of cotton and doubtless frequently they make both pay the same bill these members of the exchange being cotton brokers maintain many highpriced handsomely furnished offices in this expensive city some operating private telegraph lines to wire houses and local agents throughout the country with innumerable typewriters and stenographers all of whom must be supported and all of which must be paid for i need not ask who finally does the paying it goes without saying that the man with the hoe and the spinner who finally consumes the cotton pay the freight and is this all i only wish is were let us look a little further during last year as can be shown through compilation of statements published in the leading newspapers from day to dayand that is the only way the figures can be had nowstatistics were published by the exchange prior to 1 897 but since then it has not done so for reasons which i will hereafter statethere was sold on the new york cotton exchange 100 000 000 bales of cotton now if the buyer did not go there to get actual cotton and the seller did not carry there cotton for sale what do these vast transactions really represent there can be no doubt about what it was it was phantom cotton papercontract cotton spook cotton and yet gentlemen for every 100 bales of this mythical cotton sold there through members of the new york cotton exchange a burden of 7 50 was placed on the real cotton crop seven dollars and fifty cents are charged as commissions on every 100 bales bought or sold on the exchange these commissions alone amount to 7 500 000 per annum is this all i only wish it were it takes a vast amount of money to finance these transactionsnot based on actual cotton it is truei have shown that the actual cotton does not go to new yorknevertheless the burden of all this expense rests on the actual crop consider for a moment the money required for these transactions if 2 per bale is required by way of margin on each transaction of 100 bales the buyer and seller between them put up 400 it is a simple matter of calculation to arrive at the result showing that first and last on 50 000 000 bales of cotton 100 000 000 would be required in margins from the seller and a like amount from the buyer of course these vast suns are not all required at one and the same time but when it is used some one pays interest thereon now if a fluctuation in price takes place a further margin is required for every twenty points an additional dollar per bale must be put up and if a violent fluctuation occurs and a change of as much as 100 points is made in the market price it would represent on the years transaction one quarter of a billion dollars i would not have you believe for a moment that any such sum of money or credit is called in use at one time but during the cotton season covering the full year this vast sum in the aggregate may be required and if so some one pays tribute therefor in the way of interest what in the way of additional burden does this place on the actual crop it staggers one who attempts to make the calculation undoubtedly the producer the farmer and the consumer the manufacturer between them bear all these charges a few days since we all received through the mails a fortyfour page pamphlet containing an elaborate defense of the new york cotton exchange by latham alexander co in it i find this as the burleson bill and other bills proposed in congress to suppress the cotton exchanges of the country and transactions in cotton contracts for future delivery are simply a rehash of the antioption bill of 1892 we republish herewith our reply to senator georges argument which covered the entire subject now as a matter of fact my bill is based on entirely different principles from the bill of 1892 and this i will show when i come to discuss its details but that is not what i now am after let us turn to that part of this reply answering as to the burden placed on the cotton crop by these commissions and interest charges on money required for margins and see what answer is made i read from the reply now when it is remembered that a large part of the business transacted in the exchange is done by bankers merchants exporters and traders who are members of the exchange and who pay no comhissions it is not likely the total commission on the total transactions quoted amounted to onefourth of the sum mentioned by the senator thus we have it that on a large part of the transactions on the new york cotton exchange no commissions are paid so far the reply in part controverts the complaint made as to the burdens of the commissions now let us see what is said about the expense of interest charges incurred by the margins required to be put up by those contracting for future delivery of cotton i read from this same reply bankers merchants brokers and dealers who are members of the new york cotton exchange rarely call upon each other for original margins they have the right to do so but the right is not exercised because their contracts are considered safe and besides they have the right at all times to call upon each other for margins to cover any variation in the market calling of either an original margin or margin on account of variations in the market is purely discretionary with the dealer firms in the exchange oftentimes have large transactions with each other without margins being called this answer shows that interest charges do not accrue on the margins of some transactions taking place on the exchange but taking these two answers together we have this defender of the exchange making a more serious charge against the exchange than the one which he is defending here we have it that innumerable transactions take place on the floor of the cotton exchange where neither commissions are paid nor margins required what a temptation this affords for members of the exchange to play battledoor and shuttlecock with the market price of this great product there they stand day after day without danger of incurring more than a slight liability beating down if they see fit the market price of a great crop which is made through the sweat of millions of our people this tends to confirm a statement which i was loath to believe contained in a letter from new york and recently received by the gentleman from alabama i read from the letter in this way this gang have milked millions of money out of the public ninetyeight per cent of the dealings here are merely gambling they would at times pass the word around flow much long cotton have you on your books then compare notes and finding that the lanil s or outsiders bad 500 000 bales long they would start a bear raid and fmash the market until these longs would have to sell out or let go just then the gang would buy from the lamb thus frozen out and when he was cleaned out of his money push the market rapidly up so as to not let him get in again at the bottom hiow easy it would be to do this in the light of the statements made in this socalled defense of the new york cotton exchange thus we find the exchange impaled on one horn of the dilemma or the othereither is monstrous the truth is it renders no aid in marketing this great crop but during the period it is being marketed this exchange lays a burden on it excessively heavy which burden the buyer and seller have determined to no longer willingly carry in discussing this question i want to be absolutely fair i realize that i must be fair every error i fall into here will ultimately be pointed out and used to strengthen the opposition to what we are endeavoring to accomplishthe abolishing of this great evil the business of these members of the exchange is placed in jeopardy by the legislation proposed and not only are they shrewd and smart themselves but they have the means to employ the greatest talent this country affords and every misstatement i may make through inadvertence or ignorance will be in the end turned against us for this reason i am not venturing into the field of speculation but am tying myself down to facts and whenever i can i will use testimony they have furnished themselves to demonstrate the injury resulting from the practices of these exchanges now let us look further to see if the new york exchange performs the other functions of a legitimate cotton exchange does it assist expeditiously and economically in the distribution throughout the world of the product of 5 000 000 of our people who are engaged in growing cotton we all recognize the truth of the proposition that stability of price is one of the first essentials of healthy trade now what effect do the operations on the new york cotton exchange have on the price of cotton the mere propounding of this query brings to every mind at all familiar with the cotton trade the thought of erratic prices but in order to do no injustice let us examine the statistics on this subject i hold in my hand sheppersons cotton factsa book sent out by the superintendent of the exchange as is shown on the cover it is prepqred by an able cotton expert this book shows that for last year taking each month as i call them from the time deliveries for that month were dealt in until the close of that month the price fluctuated as follows for september from 11 1s cents per pound to s 5s remember now that this price is for the same grade of cotton for october from 11 30 cents to 8 69 cents per pound november from 11 70 to 8 85 december 11 30 to 8 90 january 11 31 to 8 99 february 11 40 to 9 06 march 11 4s to 9 02 and thus throughout the year for july the highest being 13 cents and the lowest 9 35 cents per pound thus you see that these prices are either manipulated or the unrestrained speculation keeps the market price shifting round like a howling dervishjumping like a man with the jimjams it serves to disturb prices rather than to steady them and this is continued from the beginning of the season to its end the producer of cotton is kept halting between his hope of a higher price and his fear of a lower one he knows not whether to sell or to hold as he labors through the week preparing his crop for market the price may be thoroughly satisfactory and at its close when he is in a position to sell he may find it off by a hundred points the price lacking in stability he holds perhaps to lose still more in the end do such practices aid in distributing the crop expeditiously on the contrary it has hindered it as i have shown recall the effect on trade conditions during 1904the sully year as it is called then as we all know after the bulk of the cotton had passed out of the hands of the farmer into the possession of the middlemen the price was by speculative methods forced to nearly 18 cents for middling cotton resulting in many of the mills closing down do such practices aid in distributing the crop expeditiously just the contrary it obstructs it as is shown again during the year before through a combination of cotton speculators the price of cotton was near the end of the season forced to so high a figure that some cotton which had been exported was returned from europe and as i have been told actually tendered on contracts thus as a direct result of the manipulation of prices on this controlling exchange we find cotton more valuable for gainbling purposes than it is for spinning purposes this of course again demonstrates conclusively that the new york exchange aids materially in distributing this great crop where it is needed at the least cost to those interested some one paid for the extra trip of this cotton across the seas the extra trip was occasioned by the wild speculation on this socalled exchange thus interfering with the crops final distribution hence we see that the new york cotton exchange has ceased to perform any of the functions of a useful or legitimate exchange if i am right about this if this exchange no longer serves to bring buyer and seller together imposes useless burdens on the producer and consumer and obstructs hinders and delays the marketing of this important crop the inquiry arises why should we not abolish it or enact legislation to prevent its hurtful practices if you want to do so the adoption of this amendment will accomplish that end but whenever a suggestion of legislation of this character is made we always find three timeworn stock arguments brought forward and urged in support of the continuance of cotton exchanges first it is vehemently claimed that this cotton exchange is absolutely essential to the successful conduct of the cotton manufacturers business that the spinner could not safely operate without the protection afforded thereby that the practice of the trade here and abroad is to sell the forward output of the mill and when he has done this for his own protection he must hedge against any material advance in the price of his raw material and that the exchange is the only place he can make this hedge as it is called the first fact i desire to direct attention to is the probable extent of hedging by the manufacturer we consume in this country of a 13 000 000bale crop less than 6 000 000 bales for the sake of argument we will say all this is hedged though as i will show you hereafter many manufacturers do not hedge it is probable that half of this 6 000 000 is hedged in new orleans and liverpool but this i waive and in order to be within safe bounds i allow for hedging done by the cotton buyer against loss before he places cotton purchased by him an equal amount and thus we have 12 000 000 bales hedged out of a total of 100 000 000 bales bought and sold last year on the new york exchange leaving 88 000 000 bales representing gambling pure and simple furthermore i want to direct your attention to the fact that in order to conduct a successful hedging operation it is absolutely necessary that your contract price for your futures be kept close to the market price of spots now i submit how could this be done during the past few years when there is so marked a difference in the prices of spots and futures bearing on this i want to read from an address i heard last may before the american cotton manufacturers association it was delivered by one who has had more experience in transactions on the cotton exchange than any man living or dead and who in my opinion is one of the worlds greatest cotton experts i allude to mr theodore h price and this is what he said the spinner sells his goods for delivery during january 1908 he desires to protect himself against any radical fluctuations in the market for the raw material the past years experience has shown that the new york contract affords no protection it has declined largely as a result of these fixed differences while the price of cotton which the spinner required has advanced and still it is claimed the exchange is the shield and protection of the mill man if so he ought to be the most loyal friend and supporter of the exchange if he is who would know that fact with certainty why the exchange itself and of course the chief officers of the exchangeits presidents let us see i read from an address by a former president of the exchange delivered last year in boston before the spinners themselves lie said the hostile attitude taken by the spinners of new england at the formation of our exchange and which has continued with more or less intensity during the past thirtysix years was and is to my mind a mistaken policy which the spinners of england and continentaf europe have avoided by their daily intercourse with merchants from all portions of theworld surely these mill men should not be hostile to their protectors who serve them so well now let us go to the presidents of the cotton manufacturing associations and have their testimony on this point mr s b tanner is the president of the american cotton manufacturers association and in reply to a letter from me had this to say on this point in reply to your favor of the 17th ultimo which came during my absence i beg to say that i have been informed that there is very little hedging done in the new york cotton market at present as the new york cotton market and the southern spot markets have been so far apart during the past few years however up to eight or ten years ago it seems it was a safe proposition to use the new york market for hedging purposes as the contracts were so arranged at that time that the future markets especially the current and succeeding months usually represented very closely the prices of spot cotton in the south hut for some reason this parity has not been maintained during the past few years if the new york cotton market could be so arranged as to represent the cost of spot cotton it would no doubt be a great advantage to manufacturers and dealers in spot cotton generally for hedging purposes as tile manufacturer could sell a lot of goods and probably not be able to buy any spot cotton immediately but could base his sales upon the price of cotton in new york buying the contracts promptly and do a safe business which has not been the case during the past few years for many years mr j r maccoll was president of the new england cotton manufacturers association and while holding that position he appeared before the agricultural committee at one of its hearings and on this subject had this to say"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9229333996772766, 0.9229333996772766, 0, "mr speakerwe live in deeds not years in thoughts not breaths in feelings not in figures on a dial we should

land was made by congress to aid in the construction of a railroad from portland oreg to a connection with the central pacific road in california by reason of noncompliance with the terms of the grant it became necessary for congress two years later to provide for an extension of the grant and again the conditions of the grant not having been fullilled a further extension of tile grant was had in the year 1869 and at that time an amendment was made to the original grant which amendment forms the basis of the action now proposed and it is therefore exceedingly important that amendment was as follows that the lands granted by the act aforesaid shall be sold to actual settlers only in quantities not greater than onequarter section to one purchaser and for a price not exceeding 2 50 per acre before i discuss the question of the manner in which the railroad company proceeded to dispose of the grant i desire to call attention to the fact that the resolution also treats of another and a smaller grant made in aid of a railway from portland to astoria and mcminnville in oregon and also a grant made to the state of oregon to aid in the construction of a milutary road from coos bay on the coast to the town of roseburg the grant to what became the california and oregon railway amounted approximately to 3 000 000 acres including the small amount which was included in the mcminnville grant the grant in aid of the military road amounted to about 100 000 acres these roads were not constructed in accordance with the terms of the grant but congress waiving the right of forfeiture for failure to construct within the time limit fixed in the grant and the roads having finally been completed the interior department began to patent the land to the railroad company for a time the lands were sold in substantial compliance with the conditions of the grantthat is they were sold to persons claiming to be settlers in tracts not to exceed 160 acres and for not more than 2 50 an acre

california company and its successors in interest continued this policy of selling the lands in larger areas and for a higher price and entirely ignored the provision requiring the land to be sold to

been enjoying in respect to the coming election with the idea they are to be brought into power i only want to say now that when the next congress meets i hope to be here to extend my sympathy to them i will confine myself to the consideration of certain bills advertised as pension bills my colleague has chosen under the pretense of advocating more liberal pension laws to assail the grand army of the republic its commander in chief mr burton and the national tribune a leading soldier paper published in washington city and of wide circulation in this country and he has also in various ways attacked the patriotism of this house and of individual members thereof for not supporting his bills and he has included in his attacks military homes and their management neither the grand army of the republic nor its commander in chief nor the tribune or its editor nor this house or its members nor these institutions need any defense at my hands against such attacks but as certain bills erroneously called pension bills are made the excuse for the unwarranted asapim 28 saults their true character should be stated i shall speak plainly of them and of their deceptive and political chaiacter the attaick on the republican members of the house for not supporting and passing his bills and the threatened consequences at the coming presidential election for not doing so will be a sufficient excuse for my speaking of them without reserve and plainly of the methods adopted to secure their apparent approval from veteran soldiers of the civil war not one of whom would approve either bill after knowing its true character the procedure of my colleague in relation to his bills is i believe without precedent in congressional history it is too late in the history of pension legislation to assail congress or its members or any party for lack of liberality in passing pension laws my colleagues zeal in trying to aid the democratic party on the verge of a presidential campaign must have inspired him to introduce and exploit through the press and by correspondence and by speeches here to be sent out to the country his bills as pension bills when they are not they were evidently only introduced for political purposes and not for enactment into law they are without merit and will not have the approval of anybody who understands their real import and purpose that there may be no mistake as to their character i will refer to them somewhat in detail they are not dissimilar neither is nor purports by its title to be a pension bill each undertakes only to create or enact a soldiers roll the first bill h r 4038 introduced december 3 1907 referred to the committee on military affairs is entitled a bill to authorize the creation of the volunteer service roll the other bill h r 7625 introduced december 12 1007 referred to the committee on invalid pensions is entitled a bill to authorize the enactment of a veteran volunteer roll neither bill makes any provision for pensioning anybody both the bills though separately have been proclaimed and advertised by various ways and methods to the old soldiers as though bills to pension all old veteran soldiers of the civil war at 1 per day we shall soon see that if each bill as drawn was enacted into law it would not pension anybody at any amount and that the volunteer service roll mentioned in the former and the veteran volunteer roll mentioned in the latter bill would result in having two invidious and shamefully unjust rolls from which would be excluded the larger part of the disabled most worthy and longestserving veterans of the civil war many of whom were wounded in battle and served with credit much longer in the battle front thap most of those who would be eligible to be entered on either roll no veteran soldier of the regular army nor of any other than the civil war nor any sailor or marine of any war is to become cligible to either roll the author of the bills in his recent speech here february 26 1908 described himself as a plain blunt old soldier who appears to speak a few words for 175 000 veterans of the civil war in favor of his bills giving to every veteran who served eighteen months at the front 1 per day what of the 633 3 39 disabled veterans of the civil war now drawing a pension for disability we shall soon see how absolutely misleading this statement is i quote further from his speech this movement is the most formidable movement among veterans since the close of the war there never has been any movement like it it is a spontaneous movement of the old soldiers without any organization whatever this is the only measure that takes care of the veteran soldiers all other bills that have been enacted by congress were passed through committees appointed by the grand army of the republic operating through committees of congress this bill is not a political pension bill it is a bill that recognizes only service and merit he then follows with an attack upon the grand army of the republic for having a salutary order that requires grand army of the republic posts not members when acting as such to havepetitions memorials and resolutions by posts in regard to pension legislation forwarded to national headquarters through the department headquarters and that posts be forbidden to make separate and independent application to congress for legislation upon the subject of pensions thi order is in pursuance of a resolution first adopted in 1884 and repeatedly since by the national encampment of the grand army of the republic and published ip the usual way in general orders of the commander in chief as often before without regard to my colleagues pretended pension bills and without any knowledge of them or of their misleading character the purpose of the attacks seems to be to try to demonstrate that the grand army of the republic and its pension committees and friends have not the old veteran soldiers interests at heart tbat only my colleague champions their rights then the national tribune is assailed for recently printing this order and the present commander in chief of the grand army of the republic is viciously attacked because as is assumeid he does not support the dollaraday pension bill and because as the speech alleges he should have allowed the old boys of 61 to 65 the right of direct petition at least neither he nor the order denies the old boys the right of direct petition then in contradiction of his declaration that the apprqval of one of his bills is a spontaneous movement and after declaring other things not justified by the facts the speech continues i have labored side by side for the past six months with these old veterans to create patriotic sentiment for this bill and now when it has already received favorable consideration by a majority vote of the military affairs committee of the house of representatives to have this high official who above all others should stand for justice and equity for these brave and constant soldiers attempt to cripple ourefforts for relief has overwhelmed me with disappointment and if this great measure of grateful succor to the comrades is killed in this congress the old veterans will know where to fix a part at least of the responsibility the last clause of this quotati shows the real purpose for which the bills were introducedthat is solely a political one the author of the bill in his speech further states that this bill can be passed by this congress without taking a single dollar of money out of the united states treasury simply by reducing the appropriations for the army and by mustering out the larger part thereof that the bill will only take about 17 500 000 the first year and by stopping the construction of two more of the useless battle ships that are to cost 20 000 000 by reducing the large appropriation for a standing army to maintain a government of force in the philippine islands by reducing the enormous appropriations for continuing the work on the panama canal a project he says now liable to prove the most expensive failure in all the centuries pronounced impracticable by the most capable engineers of england france germany and the united states none of these statements are warranted by the facts he then refers to petitions and letters quoting some of them from veterans and perhaps others favoring the passage of the bills as though they were pension bills the true character of neither bill is stated or explained in the speeches or in interviews or in the petition headings or in any literature sent to the old soldiers or to grand army of the republic posts or to the country hence the numerous petitions resolutions and memorials so much boasted of here looking to letters and petitions my colleague presents here we learn that the old veterans who signed them were led to believe that the bills propose to give all the old veterans of the civil war 1 per day the petitions presented by him generally show this this mistaken notion is variously promulgated i quote from his recent speech i have before me some of the petitions i have received from these old soldiers in favor of the bill that i had the honor to introduce giving to every veteran who served eighteen months at the front 1 per day no such bill has been introduced by him there are other things of like tenor stated in this speech which concludes with the now usual threat that the democratic party will afflict the country by electing bryani president of the united states this year my colleague says this result is to follow because the republican members of this congress will not pass his bills i may say in passing that mr bryans latest utterances march 5 1908 on pensions appears in the nebraska democratic platform said to be written by him which declares that his party favors pensioning the surviving veterans and their dependents because it relieves the country of the necessity of maintaining a large standing army this is pure slander"], [0.8805060982704163, 0.8805060982704163, 0, "i do not rise at this time for the purpose of defending the present administration it needs no

confusion and depression must be and are the results the legislation of the last two congresses has been charged with having produced the late financial disturbance and especially has the rate legislation as consummated by the act of june 29 1906 been blamed for the conditions of november and december 1907 there are other gentlemen democratic politicians who recognizing the fact that the people have pronounced the legislation good desire to appropriate it to themselves as capital to be used as a political asset in future campaigns it is my purpose during the brief time that i shall ask the indulgence of the house to call attention to some facts which to me seem conclusive of the various claims and charges made so recklessly and so regardlessly of the elements of logic and truth it is a conceded fact that the material prosperity of the country during the last ten years has been beyond the wildest dream of the most optimistic indeed it has been almost dangerous in its magnitude this very development brought into prominence certain great evils which had never been other than evil but which had been tolerated theretofore in dealing with these conditions no new law principle was invoked but the old common law was applied through effective instrumentalities in spite of existing law gross favoritism was shown by the public carriers to some of the people the means for enforcing just and reasonable rates and provisions were inadequate in fact beyond the reach of the injured citizen he appealed to the fiftyninth congress it listened to his appeal and wrote a new statute reviving an old law and clothing it with the power to do as well as to advise no line of that law was written in the spirit of malice or revenge no sentence was inspired by a desire to deal unjustly with any interest to be affected by it on the contrary it was publicly stated on this floor by the advocates of the measure that it was in the interest of the honest railroad and would inure to its benefit as well as to the benefit of the people at large honest railroading and general prosperity go hand in hand it is not a worthy argument against a law to prove that the criminal offender he who hopes to practice his nefarious schemes will be panicstricken before that law the question is iow is legitimate enterprise affected by it it is not my intention to explain in detail my theory of how the socalled panic was caused it is my aim to show that railroad legislation and enforcement of the law did not deter any honest man from contributing to the prosperity of the country he who reads the law of 1906 will find no section of it imposing a single provision upon common carriers which the very spirit of their charters did not contemplate they never had a right to impose otherthan just and reasonable rafes and regulations they never had a right to discriminate in fact they denied that their rates and regulations were unjust and unreiasonable and protested that no discriminations were practiced except such discrimiunations as strong and powerful shippers forced upon them and which they were anxious the congress should relieve them from they admitted that the pass evil had become a burden to them and relief was welcomed in that particular the record of the old interstate commerce counulission showed n0 cause for fear and tile courts were ever open to hear and adjust any and all injustices which a future commission might possibly inflict the carriers did not think that wrong or injury was to be inflicted upon them this is proven by the fact that the passage of the socalled eschtown send bill in february 1905 did not affect railroad stocks or railroad enter rises in spite of the fact that it was known that railroad legislation was sure to be enacted at the next session of congress the house and president being determined in the matter still railroad extensions were unchecked and investments in new railroad equipment were unparalleled the passage of the law of 1906 did not halt this mighty movewent stocks instead of going down continued to rise the new commission entered upon its work no railroad manager raised his voice against the action of the commission it confiscated no earnings or profits in the winter of 1 906 and 1907 and in the spring and smnmer of 3907 political contro ersies between the president and certain socalled great captains of industry occurred a general deuiand for the renomination of president roosevelt was being manifested these captains got busy and prophets of disaster were abroad in the land they did not represent the sentiments of men afraid of their investments for none were afraid the widows and orphans for whom the hearts of stock gamblers bleed had not learned that there was anything to fear the commission had made no general reductions of rates every car of every railroad was in commission 365 days in the year the earnings of the roads were never so great shippers who had been receiving special rates were paying the same as others those who had been riding for nothing were paying the regular fare there was no cause for fear there was no fear and lie who claims that rate legislation caused the panic or to any considerable extent legitimately contributed to it but begs the question in his desire to justify his opposition to the measure and to discredit an administration hostile to special interests and favorable to government by law for more than a year the law has been administered and during that time no one save those whose wish was father to tile thought has claimed that the effects of that law have been detriumentl to honestly conducted railroading some criminals were ibrought to justice and others were at least exposed to arrest but railroad earnings grew no less in october and novemiber last the banks in the city of new york the clearing banks for the country were raided millions of dollars were withdrawn from legitimate business and withheld from enterprise these banks could not respond to the demand of their depositors the country banks and these latter commenced to hoard their deposits in selfprotection against a run and business depression was the result if gentlemen mean that because some men who saw that the rate law itself could not disturb basiness but rather would make it more stable and therefore more desirable were still intent on discrediting it and the administration which fathered it if they mean that these men a few of them became worse than the vilest burglar who ever blew a safe or used a jimmy worse than the highwayman who in the pistols glare puts out life and steals the pursebecame worse than these and tapped the arteries of the financial system and drew out suflicient of the circulating medium to threaten commercial life with stagnation and death then i can see some logic in their contention but these logicians say that these financiers would not ruin themselves to vent their spite certainly not has anyone heard of the ruin of one of them their stocks have gone down but they hold them still and with the money they have withdrawn from circulation they can and will profit by the necessities of the less fortunate in the end these men will be found sliling and serene in the structure which they have reared on the ruins of others but let me say to those gentlemen that the country is not deceived and if it ever becomes a question as to whether we shall have gre t prosperity by the grace of malefactors or less prosperity under honest and impartial law the people have already accepted the latter and the struggle will be over before it is fairly begun i am no agitator nor do i believe as a general proposition in laws designed to make people good but i do believe in commn decency i do have faith in a government of law s uch at overnaent proclaims what by common consent is believed to lie just and prohibits what by the same authority is believed to be unwise now i am in favor of enforcing the penalty imposed by the law against every offender and i would make the penalty fit the offense where it does not already in the end law enforceient against offenders means wider liberty greater security and more enduring prosperity if we have reached that point 1nd i deny that we have when tie conscienceless powerful must be left lone in order to avert even a general panic i believe i speak the honest and thoughtful sentiment of a great majority of the american people when i say let our present business system fall and on the ruins from our great natural resources and with our patriotic citizens of all classes unhanpered and unfettered by the powerful vicious we will lay deep and strong the foundaton of an industrial edifice which call not be rocked by men who profit by the losses of others and thrive on threats of destruction but i believe our present industrial and commercial condition is secure its enemies have overestimated their strength they will learn erelongyea they are learning alreadythat the way of time transgressor is hard and he who tries to block tile wheels of justice will be ground beneath them the agitation attending the passage of the interstatecoinmerce act of 1906 has passed that act has been the law of the land for somithing over a year not long enough to test its every provision or to perfect the machinery for its complete administration but under the circumstances perhaps it has been long enough to demonstrate whether it is al instrument of justice beneficial to the people or a means of oppression inimical to the common good and disastrous to general prosperity the handiwork of statesmen or the blunder of demagogues and foolish men since before its enactment to the present time it has been subjected to attack by trained and skillful critics it has had bitter and powerful enemies earnestly and industriously intent on discrediting it i say therefore that under the circumstances it has been a law long enough to demonstrate in a measure at least whether it has been worth while it will be well for us in considering this question to bear in mind that up to the legislation of the fiftyeightl and fiftymninth congresses most of the attempts at railroad legislation had been to prevent discriminations between shippers and between places certain it is that the act of i1s7 under the construction of the supreme court was directed to that end and yet discriminations increased and in 1 906 they were generally recognized as stupendous evils some of the old methods of granting rebates had ceased but new and more invidious and therefore more dangerous means were employed today it is the universal opinion of shippers and others that rebates have practically ceased there may be some cases yet in existence but they are accompanied by as much danger to the giver and receiver as are the crimes of theft and burglary to the perpetrators of these offenses this condition is due almost entirely i believe to the act of june 29 190g it increased the peualties some viat for violations though not as much as i would have liked for i would have imnposed inlprisolnment more frequently but best of all it made detection easier it is true that we had the elkins law a statute against rebates but under it the offenses were not stopped the act of 1906 did more than increase penalties and provide means for detecting offenders it did what may i be pardoned for saying i prophesied it would do when the bill was before this house namely serve notice upon the carriers that the time had come when they must respect and obey the law this notice i submit did much to bring relief from the intoleralc rebate system respect for the law is more potent than the law itself i but as i have stated sentiment was not the sole virtue of this legislation the criminal provisions were il effect practically the same as under then existing law but the commission was empowered to fix a rate it could with reason find in many cases that the special rate was the reasonable one and declare it so this of itself was a powerful reason against granting rebates the act provided that railroad accounts should be uniforin and that the books of the companies should be subjet to inspection by experts employed for that purpose under this inspection it would be very difficult to pay rebates without having the same detected entries would appear under some name or designation several employees would have to be parties to the entries such employees would hesitate to commit a crime which would subject them to imprisonment and the more parties necessary to tile offense the greater the danger of detection the law was passed in 1906 since then we have seldom heard of rebates is it illogical to claim that the act put an end to rebates 1 the one provision of the new law which received the most bitter opposition was the section which gave the commission power to fix a reasonable rate as the maximum in place of the one found unreasonable experience under the law fully justifies the action of the congress in inserting it in the statute it furnishes the only means for obtaining just and reasonable rates and i hope to show before i sit down some of the great benefits which have actually been brought to the people thus far through the administration of this provision it is true that some of the carriers have seen fit as usual to evade the effects of this statute by indirection but they can not go entirely beyond its reach for several years carriers have been raising rates insisting that they had a right to share in the general prosperity of the country this is an unfortunate statement of their rights under existing law as construed by the courts the common carrier is entitled to impose a freight charge which will yield a reasonable return upon its investment after meeting the necessary expenses of maintenance operation and extension but it is entitled to nothing more it imposes and demands this when times are hard should it not be subject to the same rule when times are good i believe that the enforcement of the law against rebates and other forms of favoritism has made it possible for the carriers to make more money at the old rates than ever before and certainly it is the common belief that net earnings since 1898 have been sufficient to demonstrate the fact that a reasonable return to railroads has been more than realized representatives of the carriers insisted before the committees of congress that anything like a general raise of rates was impossible this statement was made in the face of the fact that rates were being raised at that time and have been raised since and without any reason other than that the traffic would stand it but how can it be said that the new lawcaused this rise in rates and if it did can it be seriously urged that it has been detrimental to the railroads and the cause of the panic there is absolutely no provision of the law which encourages the raising of rates on the contrary it furnishes the only relief against unjustly high rates and if chargea have been increased with the knowledge that upon complaint and hearing they may be reduced and reparation to the shipper made what would have taken place under the old law so far as the right to advance charges is concerned no change was made by the act of 1906 further than to require a thirty days notice of a change of rate and now may i call your attention to some of the things that have been actually done by the commission since the act of 1006 vent into effect there were filed during the year from december 1 1906 to december 1 1907 415 formal complaints alleging various violations of the act to regulate commerce there were 82 similar complaints filed during the year 1906 and 350 during the six years prior to the passage of the hepburn bill of the 415 complaints filed the commission has heard and investigated 276 and of this number it has decided and made final reports on 126 all of which were contested and resulted in final orders fully 30 more are awaiting briefs statistics and various information asked for by the commission which is necessary before final orders can be made counsel for both complainants and defendants have delayed in many instances the issuance of final orders after full hearing and investigation by the commission and upon arguments and briefs subwitted by the varidus parties to the actions final orders were issued as follows in 65 final orders were issued against various defendant railroads in 46 the complaints were dismissed and in 15 no final orders were issued due to the fact that both parties signified their intention to adjust their differences in 14 complaints in which issues were joined by both complainants and defendants the petitions were dismissed at the request of the petitioners on the ground that the defendants had granted the relief asked for by the petitioners of the 126 reported decisions by the commission 7s involved the reasonableness of the rates 32 involved discriminations of various kinds 13 involved reparation claims and 20 involved the establishment of through rates it will be seen that some of the abovedecided cases involved more than one issue that is to say a given case may have involved the reasonableness of a rate as well as a discrimination of some sort etc in all there were 5 156 matters handled by the commission of these 4 3s2 were informal in character and of this number 2 106 were returned to the complainants on account of the commnission not having jurisdiction over the matters coinplained of there were 2 276 informal complaints handled which resulted in the satisfactory adjustment of something over 1 000 cases in 660 cases refunds were permitted on orders issued by the commission on account of overcharges made by the railroads in 60 cases the rates were reduced by the railroads on account of correspondence conducted by the commission calling the attention of the railroads to the unreasonableness of certain rates complained of the remaining cases resulted in the filing of formal complaints or were otherwise disposed of thus far only one final order of the commission has been appealed from viz the preston davis case which was brought against the delaware lackawanna and western railroad company in which the commission ordered the defendants to reestablish its facilities for unloading petroleum from tank cars at clymer street at its brooklyn terminal so that the complainants could be served there as formerly the defendants appealed the case to the united states circuit court of the southern district of new york in which court the order of the commission was sustained up to the present time no further appeal has been made by the defendants of this case i have caused to be examined the records of the 50 cases which are discussed in the annual report of the commission now submitted to congress and find that of this number 40 attack the reasonableness of rates which were filed with this commission prior to the passage of the hepburn bill 5 attack the reasonableness of rates which were filed since the passage of said bill and in 3 of them some of the rates attacked werefiled prior and some subsequent to the passage of the bill in one of them the tariff complained of was not fill with the commission at all there are now 305 cases pending before the commission 198 of which are ready for trial about so per cent of these cases deal with the reasonableness of the rate thus it will be seen that the law has demonstrated the wisdom of its advocates rates in 60 out of 78 complaints were found unreasonable and reduced in many more cases rates were reduced voluntarily by the carriers when complaints were threatened would this have been done had not the commission been given power to administer justice in these matters there is one defect in the law which by proposed amendment i have sought to cure the law provides that by giving a thirty days notice the carrier may raise its rates if at the end of the thirty days and after the new rate goes into effect it is found unreasonable then complaint can be made and the rate ma3 be reduced but in the meanwhile business may have been injured shipping contracts may have been disturbed and great wrong may have been inflicted the amendment proposes to give shippers the right to complain of the proposed rate at the time notice of a raise is given then the question of reasonableness can be determined before irreparable injury has been effected and that without any injustice to carrier or shipper with this amendment freight rates can be made just and reasonable every protection against an unlawful advance in charges should be given by law since i have been in congress i have seen demonstrated the fact that patriotism and exalted statesmanship have no party labels i have seen the minority in this house at times strain truth and propriety almost to the breaking in its desperate attempts to acquire partisan advantage i have no doubt the republicans did practically the same things when they were in the minority it is really surprising what great and good things a man or party out of power would do if in power the surprise is only equaled by the paucity of things done when opportunity presents itself i said on this floor in discussing the rate bill at the time it was up for consideration that it was nonpartisan and i gave credit for its passage to democrats and republicans alike i was naturally glad that its passage was brought about under a republican congress in fact it is very gratifying to contemplate the fact that all positive progressive beneficial legislation during the last fortyfive years has been under a republican administration democrats have voted for these measures at times after they have talked against them and exhausted the realm of criticism and opposition and criticism and opposition are not altogether useless the minority has helped i believe it has rendered real service to the country during the last four years it has a nose for carrion it can scent corruption at very long range but if has no refined distinction as to the kind it will rally its members as gleefully to the carcass of a mouse as to that of an elephant and i have sometimes thought its olfactories were so abnormally developed that they were dulled to all sweet things and in breathing the miasma of death they failed to detect the odor of life it does not require great ability to find fault with conditions but it sometimes does require great ability to remedy those conditions and yet faultfinding is necessary and is the largest part of the capital of a minority i have little complaint to make at much of the criticism of our minority brothers it is true that a great amount of that criticism has been captious and unreasonable but reason was not expected and in the end after the record for home consumption has been completed the minority has voted right on most of all the great questions before the congress every little while i hear some democrat say or read of his saying that the rate bill the antitrust law and the enforcement of them are of democratic origin that republicans have stolen democratic thunder that president roosevelt to use a classical expression of mr bryan has been wearing the latters clothes ordinarily i think it is wise not to notice these things but the statements have been made so long and so loud that it is possible some of the younger generation may believe them and the democratic party may come to claim them by right of possession under the statute of limitations i shall make the claim hostile and shall dispute that either the rate bill or the sherman

proposition and is as meritorious as any that over came before us relative to laying out streets it is merely a question of continuing an already existing avenue for about 2 miles largely through government land on a flat surface where a road on a level grade can be properly built to a place that is fairly populous in the immediate vicinity of the end of this route there are something like 2 000 people it is an outlying district where people of small means can go and live the laying out of this road is to enable them to go on a level road instead of going up and down a high hill and to enable them to get to their destination by traveling 2 miles instead of 7 the possibility of this being for the benefit of supposed manufactories that may sometime come here is to me an absurdity the only objection that was ever made when this bill was first introduced some two or three years ago was from the superintendent of the insane asylum because he thought it would interfere with the proper care of the insane people in that institution and the secretary of the interior agreed with him the line of the road has been changed and has been put a little nearer the tracks of the baltimore and ohio road it is laid out through lands belonging to the government insane asylum which land is worth little and the line of the road has been so arranged that it will in no way interfere with the institution the superintendent of the asylum has withdrawn his objection the secretary of the interior has withdrawn his objection and every one who knows anything about it and who has seen the contour of that land knows that it is an important matter for the people who live at the western terminus of the road that it should be built why because there happened to be a factory where

competent to pass upon the commercial possibilities of the country besides there is no harbor of refuge between san francisco and port harford a distance of over 200 miles you will notice from the
