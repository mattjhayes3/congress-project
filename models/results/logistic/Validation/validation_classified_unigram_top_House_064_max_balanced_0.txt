when the bill is read under the fiveminute rule a reference however in a new york city newspaper yesterday to the fact that of the total amount of new projects in this bill at least twothirds are worthless has prompted me to speak briefly at this time first of all i desire to call attention to the fact that of the 47 050 112 in new projects which this bill authorizes 18 370 000 cover items in the state of new york of which all but three projects are in the port of new york and that the total comprises approximately 40 per cent of the whole amount of the new projects carried in the bill so that according to the computation of the new york city newspaper which i have referred to there must be included among the remaining twothirds of worthless projects boston harbor 1 145 000 the schuylkill river philadelphia 1 649 000 baltimore 876 000 norfolk 840 000 savannah harbor 1 920 000 tampa 1 425 000 mobile 1 030 000 honolulu 1 537 000 lake washington 657 000 grays hxrbor wash 700 000 richmond harbor 771 000 los angeles cal 626 000 ashland wis 270 000 and green bay mich 110 000 i do not believe that even my distinguished colleague on the committee will contend that any one of these projects may be classified as worthless but rather i believe if it were possible to press the question for a direct answer he would willingly concede that each and every one of them is meritorious and entitled to favorable consideration so that added thereto the delaware chesapeake canal the total amouht of new projects included in this bill which i venture topredict not even the most strenuous foe of the passage of this river and harbor bill could question we find a total of 40 324 273 leaving approximately 7 000 000 of which the greater part can be readily justified by anyone and all of which have met with the approval of a majority of the committee it might very well be that if some members of the committee who have undertaken to criticize these items on the floor under the searchlight of publicity had attended regularly the meetings of the committee and particularly while the subject of new projects was under consideration and shown anything like the same

this statement without committing an infraction of that rulethat some of the items comprained of would not be present to be objected to now mr chairman i wish to emphasize from the standpoint of the cities located upon great harbors the importance of the passage of this bill in the minority report submitted by my colleague lie calls attention to the fact that the city which i have the honor in part to represent with the great tonnage of 100 000 000 tons per annum substantially 1 ton for each person in population in the united states there was only 40 000 appropriated for ambrose channel and
