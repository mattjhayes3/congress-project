republicans to propose solutions but to criticize the kennedy administration wherever feasible this included varying the basis for the attack depending upon the area political situation the republican oregonian wisely points out that negative criticism is not sufficient when the people of this country are earnestly seeking constructive programs at a time when the republicans are seeking to scuttle one bill after another the republican oregonians editorial entitled negative gop is well worth reading negatrve gop the republican party is unlikely to begin winning national elections and the control of congress again until its spokesmen get together on constructive programs rather than negative criticism of the new frontier in seattle the republican national committee adopted resolutions blasting the kennedy administration for doing nothing to correct discriminations harmful to the lumber industry this was legitimate criticism but the committee made itself ridiculous by attributing lumbers decline to the present administration when the causes go far back beyond mr kennedys regime and by charging an administration conspiracy to bring distress to lumber in order to subject the industry to manipulation and control of the powerhungry planners of the new frontier and in washington d c while senator wayne morse frequently an assailant of bureau of land management range policies was

extend for 5 years the government guarantee of loans to certain smaller airlines for the purchase of aircraft to improve the efficiency of their operations the loan guarantee program was established by public law 85307 approved september 7 1957 the legislation was enacted to enable certificated local service territorial and helicopter air carriers to obtain reasonable financing for the purchase of modern aircraft more suitable to their needs and thereby obtain more economical operations with the view of decreasing the dependence on federal subsidy the following classes of air carriers are eligible first local service airlines second metropolitan helicopter operators third airlines providing service within alaska hawaii and puerto rico fourth airlines operating between florida and the british west indies as of march 31 1962 the civil aeronautics board has guaranteed loans totaling 40 026 526 there have been no defaults the board at that date had collected 231 683 in fees for handling applications we were told that this covers cost of administration congress adopted this program in 1957 to help the smaller airlines buy more efficient equipment witnesses in the hearings testified that it had reduced operating costs and had permitted the smaller airlines to provide more and better service authority of the board to guarantee loans under the 1957 legislation expired september 7 the pending bill provides for a 5year extension and increases the maximum loans to any one carrier from 5 million to 10 million it is necessary to raise the ceiling to 10 million because a number of the local service carriers have borrowed almost the maximum if they are to get any benefit of the extension of the program an increase in the ceiling is necessary the committee also adopted an amendment which added a new section 3 to the bill reading as follows the board shall make available to the comptroller general of the united states such information with respect to the loan guarantee program under this act as the comptroller general may require to carry out his duties under the budget and accounting act 1921 this will insure that the comptroller general acting as the agent of the congress shall have the information he deems necessary to audit this program congress has adopted a policy of encouraging the local service carriers to provide air transporation to the smaller cities special considerations of national policy involve operations in hawaii alaska and puerto rico smaller carriers eligible for loans under this program are handicapped by lack of financial resources so that they generally cannot obtain credit to purchase aircraft on the same terms as the larger carriers there are objectional features of course to any program of government guarantee of loans to buy operating equipment but in this instance the legislation enacted in 1957 seems to have put the smaller airlines in a better position to serve the public and saved them money which would have gone into higher interest payments if the government guarantee had not been available so long as the local services carriers must depend on subsidy it would seem to be good business for the government to guarantee loans for the purchase of more efficient equipment when such loans reduce the cost of operations for the participating airlines and thus reduce their dependence on goverment subsidy amendments were considered to transfer the program to the department of commerce as recommended by the administration and to make the cargo carriers eligible both were rejected inasmuch as the civil aeronautics board is handling the program successfully without any complaints we decided to let well enough alone as for the cargo carriers it was decided that this proposal goes into matters beyond the scope of the program to help the smaller airlines and that more information than was developed in the hearings is needed to make a sound judgment"], [0.9603516459465027, 0.9603516459465027,
