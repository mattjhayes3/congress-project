forests and the carrying out of a sound conservation policy if there is one thing a casual reading of the history of our young country discloses to any legislator it is the wanton cruel waste of our forests without any supervision without any thought of the future in the early days of the republic has the gentleman already forgotten the scandal during the taft administration on this question was our forest service brought about by accident or is it not the result of mistakes of the past and the necessity of having a national forest and conservation policy necessary to the very existence of our people in general and of agriculture in particular why to stand up here and attempt to abolish or curtail our conservation policy impairing proper supervision of our forestation and reforestation it seems to me discloses a willingness to ignore not only a necessary function of the government but to ignore what happened in this country in the past i submit that the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york to reduce the amount for the necessary overhead and local supervision goes to the very crux of the entire appropriations provided for in this bill i want to repeat that our forest service and our forest policy is not of political creation the forest service is not a political bureau it did not happen overnight it was brought about after years of the most wanton waste and in disregard of what other countries in the world were doing what other countries had gone through dalmatia was entirely denuded of her forests during the time she was under the control of the government of venice china disregarded the protection of her forests centuries ago and has been paying the price ever since germany had and has the ideal forest laws and conservation policy and i think our present forest policy was in a fashion patterned after the german system it is not as perfect or does not go as far as the german system but whatever we have i shall not permit without a fight to be destroyed so i repeat again simply a word of warning that we should not stand up here in the name of economy to make a show at home and ignore the lessons of centuries and the demands of the future we must legislate not only for today but we must have vision we must look ahead here is a question that goes to the very vitals of the safety not only of the country but of the farmers themselves if our forests are destroyed we will have flood problems and a great many other problems that are directly and indirectly connected do my colleagues forget the hundreds of millions of

this resolution is to provide for consideration of the bill h r 4668 which is a bill reported by the committee on flood control proposing an amendment to section 3 of the flood control act of 1928 this section as it now stands is as follows except when authorized by the secretary of war upon the recommendation of the chief of engineers no money appropriated under authority of this act shall be expended on the construction of any item of the project until the states or levee districts have given assurances satisfactory to the secretary of war that they will a maintain all floodcontrol works after their completion except controlling and regulating spillway structures including special relief levees maintenance includes normally such matters as cutting grass removal of weeds local drainage and minor repairs of main river levees b agree to accept land turned over to them under the provisions of section 4 c provide without cost to the united states all rights of way for levee foundations and levees on the main stem of the mississippi river between cape girardeau mo and the head of passes it is proposed to insert immediately preceding the section as now written the following sec 3 in the execution of the adopted project the united states shall provide flowage rights over all lands including compensation for damages to improvements thereon at the time of the taking which are not now between the existing levees and the lowwater channel of the mississippi river and which will be bet een the levee lines of the adopted project and the lowwater channel of the mississippi river by reason of setbacks extensions or other changes in the levee lines on the main stem of the mississippi river between cape girardeau mo and the head of the passes the states or levee districts may provide for the united states upon its request and at its expense such flowage rights and the united states shall reimburse the states or levee districts in full for all payments made and expense incurred in providing such flowage rights upon proof that they have been obtained at fair valuation and at reasonable expense and to add at the end of the section this language this act shall take effect from and after the date of the enactment of the flood control act of may 15 1928 by this bill an attempt is being made to make effective the intention of the congress at the time of the flood control act of 1928 was adopted the house appreciates the fact that the act was the outgrowth of two unprecedented floods that had recently occurred in the lower valley of the mississippi it was the flood of 1927 which resulted in the destruction of more than 200 000 000 of property and a loss of more than 200 lives that so aroused the country as to bring about a determined demand for some comprehensive legislation that would take care of such conditions in the act of 1928 congress first gave recognition to the principle of national responsibility for the control of the flood waters of the river it was not the first expression of congress of an interest in the subject because congress had many years previously set up the mississippi river commission which had from time to time done work toward the improvement of the river while of course as expressed in all the legislation the purpose of the government in the execution of these works under the supervision and control of the mississippi river commission was to improve navigation the improvement of the river for purposes of navigation involved the question of flood control but there had been no acknowledgment or admission of national responsibility so far as the control of flood waters was concerned in 1928 the congress adopted the act referred to as the flood control act and while the principle of local responsibility to the extent that there should be exacted some local contribution was recognized yet the congress in this act and with specific reference to the project it adopted declared that local interests had contributed to the control of the flood waters in the alluvial valley to the full extent of their responsibility and whatever the cost of the construction of protective works might be that would effectively control flood waters was upon the general government irn section 2 of that bill there is found this language that it is hereby declared to be the sense of congress that the principle of local contribution toward the cost of floodcontrol work which has been incorporated in all previous national legislation on the subject is sound as recognizing the special interest of the local population in its own protection and as a means of preventing inordinate requests for unjustified items of work having no material national interest as a full compliance with this principle in view of the great expenditure estimated at approximately 292 000 000 heretofore made by the local interests in the alluvial valleys of the mississippi river for protection against the floods of that river in view of the extent of national concern in the control of these floods in the interests of national prosperity the flow of interstate commerce and the movement of the united states mails and in view of the gigantic scale of the project involving flood waters of a volume and flowing from a drainage area largely outside the states most affected and far exceeding those of any other river in the united states no local contribution to the project herein adopted is required now mark you in so far as the execution of the adopted project is concerned there was a declaration made by the congress that no contribution of any amount in addition to what had already been made should be exacted of local interests this brings me to a consideration of the conditions with which this bill deals in the execution of the project it was found by the engineers of the war department in many instances that by abandoning protective works that were the result of more than 100 years of effort on the part of local interests and contributed to by the general government in that the government through the mississippi river commission had adopted the levee lines that had been set up by local interests and had been maintaining and otherwise improving these levee lines through all the years for the purpose of controling the river in order that it might advance and improve its conditions so far as navigation is concerned along the river there are certain bends which the engineers found in the execution of the project after the act had been adopted and after the declaration of congress was made that local interests should not be required to contribute might be cut off and entirely new levee lines constructed which would result in a considerable saving to the government and the engineers in the exercise of their discretion in the execution of this project have deviated in many instances from the original levee lines and have set up levees which cut off into the intended main channel of the river areas which in effect dedicate the properties in question to a public use and there is resistance on the part of the war department to the demand for just compensation let me direct your attention to one specific case that i have in mind it is down in arkansas and involves the land known as pecan point let me illustrate it here on this chart here is a bend in the river that comes back within 2 miles of where the first bend occurs this is not an extreme case it is a fair illustration of all other cases where land has been taken through arbitrary and seemingly senseless changes in the original levee lines made by the engineers of the war department and in reckless if not willful disregard of the rights of landowners whose property has been destroyed as i say you find the river makes this bend here and comes back within 2 miles of where the bend began along the banks of the river there are levees and they have been there for more than a hundred years they are the development of local enterprise and the government has since the creation of the mississippi river commission helped to maintain them in destroying this tract of land by this cutoff levee the government saved 400 000the difference between the cost of strengthening the levee around the bend by revetment and otherwise and the cost of the cutoff levy the cost of improving the original line was estimated at 600 000 and that of new line at 200 000 and still there is objection to compensating the owners of this land that has been taken from them"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00016123056411743164, 0.49983876943588257,
