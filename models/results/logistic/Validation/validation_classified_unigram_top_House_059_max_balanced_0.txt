pay my respects to some of the arguments that he made the first consideration of the republic is the welfare of the people how to promote general prosperity and prevent tme undue concentration of wealth is one of the problems that confronts us today it was the hope of our fathers that in the growth and development of the republic we would speedily reach that minimum of governmental interference with the efforts and the interests of the citizen which should give him the fullest liberty consistent with security and surrender the whole round of human life as completely as possible to the beneficent action of natural law that government is wisest and best which encourages industry and restrains not the proper activities of men the government wants every legitimate enterprise in the country to prosper but it does not want any of them to prosper at the expense and destruction of the others since jacobs cunning obtained the birthright of esau it has been necessary to place metes and bounds about human conduct and restraints upon the hnproper activities of men in the struggle for existence in the race for the comforts and conveniences of life the citizen is entitled to fair play and a square deal when lie is diligent in business enterprising and industrious and conditions operate to deny him a fair share of material things they are depriving him of the full and free enjoyment of his life liberty and property no man is independent of his fellows his conduct will affect them for good or ill as long as he recognizes the r ights of others as he should and remembers his relation to society and is actuated by a spirit of fairness and justice in all that he does society has no complaint to make the government finds no fault with his conduct but when lie regards the rights of others as useless obstacles in the way of his greed and society as an inviting field for sharp practice theni he becomes an object of regulation for the law that regulation of economic agencies which encourages industries and enterprises and furnishes ample reward for the proper activities of men are symptoms of genuine progress we are not here to legislate in the interest of men who are seeking the advantage of their fellows but we are here to legislate in the interest of the great mass of the people it is ours to point out the road of national progress in economic life we want laws that will increase freedom for the many in all the fields of human endeavor those members of society who observe the rules of right must be protected against time lawless and the unscrupulous ones it is our duty as the representatives of the people to guard the interests of the masses and promote their general welfare we should study the condition of our complex economic body as the physician studies the condition of his patient we must know something of the various branches of political and social science and we should contribute to that moral force which induces men to acknowledge the truth and do what they know is right for the whole art of government said jefferson consists in the art of being honest plato and aristotle did not ask how can a nation become wealthy but ihow can the economic institutions and arrangements of a nation be so ordered that the highest welfare of all citizens may be best promoted unless the economic body throughout is in a healthful condition there can be no real prosperity for prosperity is industrial health the question is shall we correct the evils that exist or allow them to go on until every member of the economic body is injuriously affected or dangerously impaired the interstate commerce commissions report shows the criminality of the packers and the railroads and it denounces their methods as in open disregard of the law how can we expect the citizen in the common walks of life to be lawabiding how can we expect him to respect the law when such flagrant violations by large concerns are noted every day in the public press if we would have the law respected the law must be enforced when a combine rich and politically powerful violates the law the statute is suspended and the court is deaf we need men who have the courage and the disposition to enforce the law edmund burke has truly said when the people conceive that laws and tribunals and even popular assemblies are perverted from the ends of their institution they find in these names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent it was never intended by the founders that this government should be converted into a bureau issuing letters of marque under which the kings of illgotten gain should prey upon the substance of the people lawless capital in combinations is making moral cowards of men they make it so uncomfortable for the young man to thrive outside of their business enterprises that lie is driven to the wall or forced to take his place at their bidding in a niche of the great combination they regard the skill and energy of men as objects of prey for their greed that condition in our economic body that puts the skill and energy of the many at the mercy of the few is eating on the vitals of this republic the interstate commerce commission in its annual report for 1904 said we said in our reports to congress for 1902 and 1903 and now repeat that in view of the rapid disappearance of railway competition and the maintenance of rates by combinations attended as they are by substantial advances in the charges of many articles of household necessity the commission regards this matter as increasingly grave and desires to emphasize its conviction that the safeguards required for the protection of the public will not be provided until the regulating statute is thoroughly revised the commission was establishedsays mr justice harlanto protect the public against the improper practices of transportation companies engaged in commerce among the several states and mr justice harlan in a dissenting opinion said in substance and now the commission is a useless body for all practical purposes the only right of the commission is to commence a suit against the railroad to compel it to revise the rate while the company can continue to charge such rate that it deems best pending a lengthy litigation when congress is about to convene or a state legislature is sdon to assemble these great interests whose conduct has been discussed and criticised over the country bestir themselves in various ways to stay the hand of just regulation court authorities that were silent all spring summer and autumn while congress was not in session have since the speaker called the fiftyninth congress to order been making strenuous efforts to indict parties guilty of making secret agreements with railroads constituting a conspiracy this note of warning this bold declaration from court officials who have been winking the off eye will doubtless send terror into the ranks of the railroads and cause them at least to smile the inquiry naturally arises why were not these investigations made before now why all this activity on the part of the courts when the matter of rebates and freight rates is up for consideration by this house is not this done to impress us with the idea that the authority for regulating railroads already exists in passing the act of 1887 creating the interstate commerce commission the supreme court declared thatadministrative control over railroads through boards of commission was no new thing but that the granting of such power is never to be implied from any doubtful or uncertain language that has been the trouble with the laws heretofore they have been full of loopholes and escape ways placed there for a special purpose and that purpose was not in the interest of the people the supreme court declared thatcongress has not conferred upon the commission the power to prescribe the rates either maximum minimum or absolute then i ask the question if you confer upon the commission the power to declare a rate to be unreasonable why not confer upon it the power to declare what would be a reasonable rate it is not the policy of the democracy to interfere without just cause with the interest of private concerns nor does she desire to fetter commerce by unjust restrictions and it is not her intention to confiscate the property of the railroads and the railroads do not believe that such is her desire but the party does insist upon one just and fair standard of conduct for all public interests this is democratic this is right yes the railroads have rights but they do not possess all the rights their interests should be considered but theirs are not the only interests to be considered until we regulate them in the interest of fairness and justice to all concerned we will not have discharged our duty freight rates affect the price of every article that goes into the home of the consumer the people do not want to cripple or hurt the legitimate interests of the railroads but the people do want fair treatment at the hands of the railroads there is no use to be excited because the people are becoming aroused and are manifesting an interest in their own affairs whenever the people get aroused on any line that affects their interests there is a mighty class who employ every agencythe press as much thereof as can be controlled and that is no small portionto quiet the people and to assure them that their grievances are all imaginarya mere myth although surrounded by difficulties and pinched with hardships in the struggle for existence these mighty interests tell them you are doing well let well enough alone and if a public man is found who comes out on the side of the people and pleads for a betterment of their condition points out the mighty evils that disturb them they call him a demagogue time was when lie who championed a righteous cause was a brave man in the eyes of the american people and he who never counted the cost or regarded the strength of the opposition and dared to speak the truth was indeed a hero why is it that the name jackson is so loved by the mass of the american people because in life he contributed all that it was in his power to contribute to the wellbeing of the great mass of the people jackson was loved by the people because lie was their firm and fearless friend trhe crafty avaricious classes despised him because he openly denounced them as enemies to the government in which they lived ie allowed no barrier to stand between him and the people he loved so well the purseproud plutocrats of his day despised him but clad in the simple costume of democracy and armed with a righteous cause he drove them from the highways of the republic exclaiming from the deepest depths of his patriotic soul by the eternal gods the people shall rule this organized power that we are dealing with today is tremendous and must be curbed for history furnishes no instance where power ever limited itself within the limits prescribed by the constitution it is our duty to do everything possible to prevent this power of railroads and other combinations from absolutely destroying legitimate competition i am aware of the fact that those who oppose this measure have all the data that diligence can acquire and all the argument in support of their position that human genius can devise the discussion of this question has brought out the fact that the issue is sought by some to be kept between the shipper and the railroad there are other parties to this issue the parties who are most affected are the producers and the consumers the producer who is dependent on a market miles away on the railroad is seriously concerned in the matter of rates if ills competitors can reach the market with their products at a less expense than he can he is embarrassed and handicapped the lower the rate the greater the profit to the producer the colsumer who is largely ignored and cunningly left out of this discussion feels keenly the evil of unjust freight rates for after all when the produce is shipped and flnally sold to the consumer the original cost the cost of shipping and a little profit of course all come out of the pocket of the consumer the shippers are not alone in their demand for just and fair treatment at the hands of the railroads a vast army of american producers and consumers are making the same demand xl 120 mr w c tricket of kansas city mo before the senate committee on interstate commerce said among other things the complaint on the part of shippers throughout the country is that certain shippers are favored by the railroads directly or indirectly and that rates are not the same for all we are told by judge fifer who are benefited by rebates and drawbacks only a few large shippers by thepayment of rebates to large shippers it enables them to break down and run out of the business their competitors thereby lessening the number to whom the original producer cin sell goods so it affects the producer and the consumer also and kills competition for the more buyers in the market place the better it is for the farmer or for any other man who wants to sell his produce judge fifer says you frequently hear large shippers and middlemen remark that they do not care anything about the amount of the rate provided the traffic will move who then is most injuriously affected by the high rates a vast army of consumers and original producers judge fifer speaking of railroads said they do not like to come out flatfooted and admit that they charge as much as the traffic will bear but they do all the same shall they be allowed to make any rate then that suits them although it be unjust and oppressive with competition gone and combinations controlling the rate what will become of the interest of the shippers consumers and producers judge fifer says when the railroads go to make these rates they do not apply the golden rule but they apply david harums golden rule do the other fellow before he has time to do you judge fifer said the rate on cotton cloth from new york to salt lake city is 2 30 per hundred for carrying it 800 miles farther all the way from new york by salt lake city to san francisco it is only 1 and that 1 rate affords them a slight profit now then lie asks is not their profit of 1 30 per hundred in excess for less than nearly a thousand miles excessive that lie contends and rightly so is the question whereupon senator cuom asked him does not that fact almost absolutely make it appear unreasonable to charge 2 30 senator cullom means of course for the short haul yesreplied judge fifer from new orleans to the virginia cities richmond lynchburg and norfolk the distance is 800 miles charlotte n c is just half the distance 400 miles and yet the rate per ton per mile to charlotte is four times as much as it is per ton per mile to either one of the other citieslynchburg richmond or norfolk if they cal make a small profit as they do on this long haul is not the charge for the short haul excessive and is not this treatment of charlotte outrageous the railroad enterprise is hedged about as no other concern is hedged in this coutnry a railroad company goes out to build a railroad through a certain section of country they are armed and equipped by the law with the exclusive right to build a road through that territory assured from the outset that they will have no competition through that country from any other road the people many of them give the right of way others contribute timber and not infrequently they give moniey no spot of earth is too sacred for a railroad bed if your burying ground lies in the track of the survey it falls a victim to their condemnation proceedings and sells at a price fixed by court authorities they can take and condemn private property the government grants right of way across navigable streams when the road is complete the law hedges it by saying you shall not deprive it of a fair return on the money invested these large concerns laugh at injunctions and civil suits tley need to be prosecuted criminally and made to respect and observe the law if there is evidence enough to sustain an injunction the same evidence ought to be sufficient to procure an indictment the law is over all and it must be respected and enforced the impression prevailsand it is largely truethat the plain people must obey the law and for every violation suffer its pains and penalties that only those who move in the common walks of life are subject to the law every fairminded man deplores this state of things whether he be a private citizen or public official village merchant or corporation president he should be made to respect and observe the law when these gigantic concerns contribute to the campaign funds of any particular party they expect favors in return from that party when it gets in power if members of congress are beneficiaries of such a fund how do you expect them to be very strenuous in their efforts to pass laws that would injuriously affect those favorite concerns i will relate a little story that illustrates the idea that i have a fellow who was charged with the larceny of a cow was acquitted by the jury and upon being asked by his attorney how he accounted for the verdict of acquittal when the evidence so clearly established his guilt said that is very easily accounted for eleven of the twelve jurors got some of the beef it is the duty of the railroad to furnish all cars all necessary equipment to carry on all the necessary traffic of the people and in view of this fact all shippers should be placed on the same footing and whether they own cars and other facilities for shipping purposes they should be made to pay the same rate that other shippers pay when we urge the necessity of regulating freight rates we are confronted with the statement that the rate is lower here than in any european country railroads have already combined in all the european countries and in this republic of the west they are combining with unprecedented rapidity and unless congress lodges the power somewhere they will when the combination is all perfected charge as much if not more than they charge in the european countries now the gentleman from pennsylvania says give us time w hy this unprecedented haste in the matter of regulating railroads for nine long years the transportation companies have been sucking the lifeblood of the producers and the shippers of this country unprecedented haste nine years we have had the interstate commerce commission with no power to enforce any order with no law to guide them in regulating freight rates and yet it is most appropriate that this astounding statement should come from one of those blest in large measure with this worlds goods the gentleman wedrs the robes of wealth becomingly and is modest with it all this is proper no impulse truly noble ever sprung from pride of purse he ought certainly to know something of the democratic feeling on this and other questions that affect the people as well as the republican feeling because the gentleman if my recollection serves me aright has been in both parties and he certainly ought to know what they stand for and how they feel why the gentleman says whence comes this cry for rate regulation i will ask the gentleman to go and read the printed pages of your interstate commerce commission every year they are urging this body they are clamoring at the door of this house and begging congress and the president of the united states to give them some power so that they may answer the demands for rate regulation in this country can it be that the gentleman is deaf and does not desire to hear a demand of this character he speaks of this unprecedented haste millions and millions of dollars the transportation companies have plucked from the purse of the people during the nine years that the commission has been without power commercial bodies are petitioning this body the shippers in the gentlemans own state have petitioned this body have asked it to do something to give them relief not only that but petitioners in every state in the union are asking this body to do something and let me vow make a little prophecy to the gentleman you should have settled this iluestion in the fiftyeighth congress you had the oppoitunity to settle it but you would not it went into the tomb at the other end of the capitol they had a committee sitting during the recess i call it a delay committee if you will read the testimony taken before that body it will impress you with the idea that the chairman of that committee is hard to enthuse on the matter of regulating railroads before that body governor cummids from iowa testified in a speech when he returned to his home he said that a mighty and powerful railroad lawyer sat by the chairman and suggested nearly all the questions that were put to him by the chairman and he said they crossquestioned him as though he was a witness on the stand in court investigating in the interest of the people god save the mark but let me finish that bill died in the senate this bill may die in the senate if so i want to tell you that the patience of the american people has about reached its limit when the fall elections are over this year there w111 be more democrats occupying your places than there are nv because the republican party is responsible for the failure to give the people relief and you can not fool the people by passing it in the house and letting your party kill it at the other end of the capitol the people are aroused on this question why if the gentleman will go out and get in touch with the people he will find what they want unprecedented haste this is a remarkable statement for the gentleman to make with petitions coming here just literally flooding this house petitions coming from nearly everybody except thos e that the railroads can control you will see a convention assemble at their bidding and it will petition you not to do anything to disturb the railroads that shows you what a tremendous power the railroads have and exercise i have no prejudice against the railroads i trust that i am in a position to do what is right and right is right as god is god it matters not who is affected the private citizen or the greatest corporation in this country the gentleman from michigan has truly said this question will not down i now wish to call attention to what many of the shippers have to say upon this question of railwayrate regulation no trust or extremely large corporation but every name is a representative one in the commercial world these concerns are large shippers of freight hence with them the question of fair rates and just practices is not a theory they furnish the railroad income they pay the freight arkansas says while we are not antagonistic to the railroads we should have some means of settling just propositions and not be held up as we are upon one pretense and another a voice from the indian territory says these unjust discrimination and abuses in freight rates have bankrupted many good men and prevented the development of many a rich section of the country from kentucky comes the cry for relief from unjust freight rates unfair practices and discriminations on the part of common carriers a voice from massachusetts wants prompt action and substantial justice when differences arise between the shipper and the railroad minnesota expresses the hope that something may be done in the matter of freight transportation mississippi feeling the sting of unjust discrimination and rebates cries out for equal advantages for freight rates and hear what missouri has to say the abuse of rates drawbacks special privileges and special concessions to some shippers has grown to such an extent that some remedy should be applied at once in order to bring justice to all alike continuing it declares this problem was never worse than at the present time in all our experience in the grain business we have never known the time when the offenses were so flagrant the people are sorely in need of more prompt adjustment of the transportation difficulties which beset the shippers of this country a voice from new york proclaims thatthe small shipper is at the mercy of the railroads discriminations are practiced from which appeals to the railroads are in vain we are losing trade especially in the south by the enormous freight rates lately raised the carriers have had full sway for many years and have proven their profits by their annual reports which come out of the freight producer the tariff as it now stands is unjust and the matter of rate correction and overcharges should be corrected north carolina says something ought to be done to relieve the people from unjust freight rates and listen to ohio traffic abuses must be rectified shippers everywhere are asking relief at the bands of congress hear the cry from pennsylvania present freight rates are out of all proportion and there should be some interference by the government tennessee joins in the demand for deliver~ance from high rates and irregularities in freight matters texas declares that she is in favor of some stringent means of controlling freight rates the interstate commerce commission she declares should not only have the right and authority to make rates but to enforce them as final west virginia the home of senator elkins complains of unjust rates discriminations in freight rates and begs congress to do something to end the evil connecticut says in the matter of freight regulation that something should be done and done without delay butshe declaresthere will no doubt be an immense amount of opposition against it from the great railroad corporations florida declares that the regulation of freight rates is a piece of umuchneeded legislation hear what indiana has to say she declares absolutely and unqualifiedly in favor of goverrmen control of railroads kansas takes her place alongside her sisters in the demand for fair play and honest freight rates and declares that discrimination unjust rates and unfair practices which now figure so conspicuously in railway transportation must be removed louisiana lifts her voice in solemn demand for transportation adjustment maryland emphasizes the fact that discriminations in the traffic in this country is an enormous amount and should be punished by law a voice from michigan bears testimony to the fact that the people of this country need adequate and prompt relief for we are now confronted with serious delays between shippers and railways and urges that the judges or interstate commerce commissioners should not be allowed to accept any favors from the railroads in the shape of passes or other things of value hear what virginia has to say when we come to appreciate that probably 10 per cent of the value of all commodities grown mined and manufactured is paid out for transportation we see what an enormous amount of money is paid out in freight and the people are entitled to some part in establishing and maintaining rates on this immense traffic a voice from wisconsin declares the freight abuses and rates and discriminations given to favored shippers should be remedied as they operate seriously against the unfavordd shipper and are not a fair deal alabama cries out against unjust rates rebates and discriminations that bear heavily not only upon the shipper but upon the small merchant the large merchant the producer and the consumer for every man who buys farm implements machinery of any character or food and raiment pays part of the rate tax the gentleman from pennsylvania makes an eloquent appeal to do nothing to disturb the railroads he fears that socialism will seize upon the throat of this government and quotes from some little fellowi hardly know how to class himprating about a division of property why those things have been written about since the foundation of the world an idea like that afloat in the mind of some man out yonder has nothing to do with this question and no man in this body will ever believe in such doctrine as that it is not strong enough to hold up before the mighty march of the representatives of the people in this land at a time like this to deter them from doing what they believe to be right they are going to see to it that soweting is done but i will tell the gentleman how to keep down socialism i will tell him how to keep down anarchy enforce the law against the mighty rich as well as you enforce it against the uninfluential poor lay the hand of criminal prosecution upon the back of dives in his purple and fine linen as you do upon the lazarus who wears the tattered garments of poverty and want and you will keep down socialism and anarchy i can not think that the gentleman is much alarmed he talks about wringing every dollar in taxes out of large concerns it has been my observation and i have served upon the assessment board as secretary of my state that the man of comparatively small means bears the burden of taxation everywhere one of these gigantic concerns can give in its property at 50 000 that may be worth millions and the tax assessors know nothing about the value of it but the man holding property in sight like land or mules the assessors can get at the value of them and so i say that the man of small means with his goods in sight the simple things in life bears the burden of taxation today the gentleman from pennsylvania says that the railroads have been groping their way under tremendous difficulties they havethe best eyesight for fellows groping in the dark that i ever saw for they never fail to put their hands properly on the fellow who has produce to ship and if you read the figures in the columns at the end of the year in their reports you will agree with an editorial that appeared in a london paper in october which said that if they were let alone a little while longer they would have all the capital they need now or would need i agree with that but while this railroad enrichment is going on what will become of the producer the shipper and the consumers all over the country we do not want to harm any legitimate enterprise but we do want as the president sometimes says a square deal the president is a man with some noble impulses he gets right occasionally and he has got a good ear for the ground he can hear the mutterings and rumblings below he is the best politician in his party ile sees the people marching and hears the tramp of the multitude in this government and knows what it means and he straightway writes a message to this body and he says regulate the railroads the gentleman from pennsylvania has had the courage to say you democrats are entitled to all the credit for this movement he is giving us back our own we are entitled to it we started it and we will keep it up the republicans advocate things on the stump that they forget when elected to office bees on flowers alighting cease their hum and republicans in office soon grow dumb the gentleman from ohio said not long ago that the spirit of bryan permeates the party as no other man has ever permeated it since jacksons day why is this a young man called upon senator hoar and asked what he would advise him to read senator hoar said read the lives of jackson jefferson and washington and men who have stood for something that is why the spirit of bryan permeates not only our party but the mass of your partybecause he is a man who stands for something the gentleman from pennsylvania says this bill has the indorsement of bryan and hearst i suppose that would go a long way toward making him oppose the measure the question was asked the other day in the senate do you think bryan will be the next democratic nominee for president we do not know who will be the next nominee but he will be a man who stands for something and who has talked for something and if mr bryan is the nominee a man whose every heart throb is loyal to the masses of the people pampered by no power and pensioned by no class if he does come into the white house he will break down the trust idols in the temple of liberty as daniel of old broke the gilded images of babylonish idolatry why the gentleman says you are going into the government business of regulating things does not the government say today to the private citizen and to the banker how much interest his dollar shall earn in a year when he loans it out does not your law in every state in the union limit the earning capacity of the dollar of the bank or of the private citizen when it is loaned does not the government regulate national banks and send your inspector four times a year announced and one time unannounced to investigate and inquire into the funds do we not do these things with these interests if so are the railroads too sacred to have themselves investigated and regulated in the spirit of fairness and justice"], [0.053676068782806396, 0.9463239312171936, 1, "the man never lived in this world and

andrew jackson who approved the very kind of a bill that i have introduced in this house to aid these sufferers this is not all in looking over the press reports i have here i find that there were about eighty churches that have been demolished in san francisco and my heavens you will not reduce the tariff to aid in rebuilding gods churches and yet the platform of the republican party is in thebeginning the republican party created the heavens and the earth you will not take care of your ownif it costs you anything you will not lift the robber tariff even from the mudsills that are to hold up gods church back in the land of flowers and gold though you worship the golden calf why we are selling and delivering material in england for the purpose of fencing in or out rabbits that is a factthe press states you are selling it there cheaper to fence in or out rabbits than you do to protect the republicans and the democrats their wives their daughters their sons their homes and houses ah we passed a law similar to the andrew jackson statute for the benefit of railroad building in the philippine islands yes you cheapen railroad material to build railroads for the yellowbellied filipinos yet when it comes to the restoration of the homes of the exalted and the poor and of gods churches in griefstricken california the republican party stands pat unfortunately the delegation so

speak thus today but i do so because the people of tennessee love californians and justice is being denied her people californians took care of the immortal first tennessee regiment when they went to the philippine islands and when they returned and that good old woman mrs townsend now dead and gone spent fifteen or twenty thousand dollars of her money to take care of them when they were hungry weary and worn away from home we love the californians and if the great lawmakers from that state in this house and in the nation do not want to crush the steel trust the lumber trust the cement trust

back all the time to the number of watches exported by the elgin company or sold by the elgin company for export nobody contends that the elgin company exported them moreover he seems to forget that in the present condition of industrial affairs in this country there is almost a habitthere are a great many instances at any rateof people deceiving the factory by pretending to buy for export when they are really buying for domestic sale and their object in deceiving the factory is that the factory has a lower price for purchases for export than for purchases for domestic sale it by no means follows even if we admit the absolute veracity of every statement made by the elgin company as regards the number of watches that they have exported or sold for export that that number comes anywhere near agreeing with the number of watches that have been actually exported or sold in our market why i remember if the gentleman will excuse me in a speech upon this floor in the fiftyseventh congress i believe it was in the speech upon tariff barons and tariff beggars i quoted from an editorial in a great manufacturers journal i have forgotten which oneit is in the recor an article in which the journal complained of the bad faith and trickery and swindling passed upon the manufacturers of the country by men who bought under the pretense they were buying for export when really they wanted to sell the goods in america and especially one demonstrated instance which will appear in that editorial then quoted by me was concerning somebody who bought a lot of steel stuff under the pretense that it was to be sold in british columbia and then managed to have it landed en route at some point in the state of washington and this trade journal absolutely called up to the halter almost called up to the judgment seat at any rate and sentenced this purchaser as a vile swindlerthis man who had told this lie in order to get these goods in order to commit the great crime of letting american citizens have the goods cheap rather than sell them cheap to british subjects across the line as he had promised the factory to do now that that man did lie there is no doubt that a gentleman would not have lied there is equally no doubt i do not stand here to say that the man who did the thing did a right thing but i cite it merely to prove a condition of things so chronic that absolutely manufacturers journals complain about it as a constant swindle and menace to the trade now then i want to call the gentlemans attention to another fact if keene did not import these watches or reimport them then the customhouse records will show it the copies of the invoices which had to be shown to the customhouse officials are there somewhere i am informed by the gentleman from illinois that he has made every effort to get the government to give him certified copies of those papers and that he has met with refusal or failure at the hands of this republican administration presumably protecting these the beneficiaries of its peculiar policy let the gentleman if i may use the inelegant phrase rub his mind up against these two propositions why is it that the watchmakers took the trouble to make themselves a party to prevent the reimportation of the watches turned back if they could not be hurt by it how could they he hurt by it if they did not fear underselling how could there be any apprehension of underselling if the price at which they had been sold for resale abroad was not one less than that at which like watches were sold here aye not only less but so much less as to enable the reimporter to be able to lose freight both ways and yet sell in our sheltered market at a profit sufficient to induce him to go into the business and to try to stay in it if it be true that their price abroad be equal to the price at home or evtn if it be true that it is only a little less or so near the price at home that the freight across the ocean and the freight back would make the goods cost as much money or more when brought back as they would have cost if bought originally for the home market and held here from the beginning then what interest do these people have in making themselves a party to stopping the reimportation then this second and more significant fact why did they i refuse to deliver the watches in england when they found out t what keene was doing and when sued why did they pead that the man who bought had said he was going to sell them 6019in france what makes it a crime or a breach of business faith to send those watches back to america what makes it a violation of the vital interests of the waltham company and the elgin company for what reason did the companies object after all is said and done what is it the keene folks are caught in doing they are caught in committing the stupendous fraud of bringilig back to america to sell to americans goods they had bought under a promise to sell to frenchmen thpt is the whole thing in a nutshell there is no way to get around it the watch companies had sold at their price the case companies had sold at their price what difference to them was it to whom as watch wearers the watches were to be sold the only rational solution of it all is this first that they have one price in europe as mr tirrelr confessed and another price here and secondly that they hhve an agreed price in this sheltered marketsheltered by the tariff on watchesto such an extent that an agreement can be successfully entered into and carried out which they dare not allow to have the first breach made in the moment that anybody begins to sell those watches upon the american market cheaper than the american listed price that moment this agreement between somebodyand judging by the contracts here it is between the jobbers and the factories and the retailers all all along the linethis combination as to prices between somebody goes to pieces and that moment that thing which the republican party promised years ago would take place as the result of protectionwould actually take place not as a result of protection but in spite of it and what was that thing they said if you protect these infant industries you will after a while have a sufficient number of home producers and home manufacturers to bring down the price by competition with one another to the foreign price now then to avoid that promised resultbecause in spite even of any obstacle legislatively erected that sort of thing might possibly in the course of time take placethis combination as to prices is entered into meanwhile the people would have paid an enormous price for the legislative hastening process but to prevent that end which would come upon the consummation of the hastening process these people enter into their agreementi do not care whether you call it a trust or notinto their combination to charge a certain price let us call it in what market in the american market why not in the foreign market because they are not sheltered there they could not carry out the agreement there why in the american market why to keep the very things which the republicans promised would take place after the establishment of industries from taking place now in that connection i want to read an article from a paper that is dear to the heart of my friend from connecticut who is now looking at me it is from the old hartford courant a good old paper a little oldmaidish in its ways but mighty true and mighty truthful i cut this out of the washington post it is headed the shabbiest fraud the language the shabbiest fraud is that of the hartford courant itself as you will see in a moment the hartford courant is a republican paper of the better sort of the commonsense sort not of the standpat sort the hartford courantsays the washington postwhich was a venerable newspaper long before the republican party was born and has been a strong and consistent advocate of republican principles and policies ever since the birth of that party finds it hard under present conditions to put up the defense of protection that the system deservessays the washington post and you know the washington post is upon the principle of protection a republican and not a democratic paperwhen open and avowed enemies of this beneficent policy show up the trickery and hoggishness of certain protected interests and then denounce protection itself our contemporarys trouble begins i would not use that language it would be unparliamentary coming from me when for example the free traders or tariffforrevenueonly advo cates show that some of our principal manufacturers habitually sell their products in foreign countries at prices far below those which their home patrons are compelled to pay mark that word compelled my friends are they compelled by the manufacturers no by the trusts or manufacturers that make a combination no but by something back of that by the big stick in the hands of these people and what is the big stick the tariff no manufacturers in the world could by a combination compel me to pay more for a plow than that plow sells for in the argentine if other people all over the world who make plows could sell me a plow in the united states are conpelled to pay they put a plausible argument into the mouths of antiprotectionists and the plausibility of that argument is so difficult te expose that it is often accepted as sound logic well i reckon it is the washington post continues of course it is a fallacy for there is not a more thoroughly and overwhelmingly vindicated policy in the arena of american politics than the protection of home industries protection of home industries how generous that sounds how cunningly that sort of language is devised to make you forget that while protectionism protects some home industries it taxes in order to do it all other industries and all consumers the word some ought always to precede the phrase home industries if the sentence is to express truth and not pretense it stands so firmly that its enemies can not overthrow it even with the aid of those false friends of protection who persist in abusing it for their own advantage now here we have what the hartford courantdear old veteran abolition republican papersays the shabbiest fraud that is played on the united states by managers of protected industries is this trick of misusing the protection that we provideof making it benefit foreigners to our disadvantage if it were necessary to maintain a certain price in order to maintain protection then everyone would accept the situation unless he were a free trader of the pronounced stamp who advocates shutting up every factory that can not run without protection but it is a different proposition when a protected factory makes americans pay for the protection and then gives foreign countries the benefits of successive cheapening processes it is all nonsense to talk of the policy as necessary if the goods can be sold in paris at 30 per cent less than the price asked for them in new yorkmark the languagethen they can also be sold in new york at the lower price and the difference represents the excess of profit which is extorted from the american people protection like every other institution or policy must justify itself protection in america for the benefit of european consumers can not be justified that last clause from the hartford courant i especially recommend to your tender memories the post continues there are not many protection newspapers that emulate the candor of the courant but a great and growing number show their sympathy with the views of our venerable hartford contemporary the amer ican people are too fair to complain of any man or association of men for making money by fair business methods but they do not believe it is fair for their congress to legislate millions of money out of the pockets of the consuming masses into the hands of a comparatively few persons the demand for reform is becoming extremely insistent a sense of injury too long endured lends a strong coloring of anger to the call for relief so much for the old hartford courant why from the federalist and whig standpoint even at the beginning at the inauguration of this protective system nobody ever contemplated the notion that there would be perpetual protection for anything the first new tariff acts passed in this country were passed for a limited number of years to expire at the end of that time clay and hamilton and all of them said that they were passed for the purpose of putting infant industries upon their feet ah above the portals of the committee on ways and means we find the inscription in letters almost visi ble no infant need enter here you must have influencepolitical or financialpower capital and then you can get whai is called protection but what an honest intellect prefers to call legislative favoritism now so much for the speech of my friend from illinois"], [0.06657016277313232, 0.9334298372268677, 1, "much has been said of the danger of the proposed railroad legislation gentlemen in their dread of the direful results that are to follow from what they call this novel departure have allowed themselves at times to be carried literally off their feet by the hysteria of eloquence or fright is it true that this is a novel departure is it true that in proposing to regulate the rates charged by a common carrier or the tolls upon a public highway we are for the first time wandering off in the devious ways of populism and anarchy why the doctrine of this bill is as old as the common law itself for centuries the right of the legislature and the right of the courts to place restrictions upon those who operate a public highway has been acknowledged and enforced a railroad is inherently and in every sense a public highwaynothing more and nothing less it is a common carrier it is a public servant and because it happens to be worth in all of its ramifications 16 000 000 000 it is none too big still to bea public servant of the american people it is governed by the law that governs the public servant and the public highway from time immemorial the courts and legislatures have taken jurisdiction of tolls charged upon highways or exacted by ferries where the other side of the question was presented and the carrier discharged a public function there is no difference in law there is no difference in morals between the legislature of a state saying to a man operating a ferry upon a river half a mile wide you shall charge no more than a certain sum for carriage of persons and teams across that stream and saying to a man who operates a locomotive along a few miles of steel rails you shall only charge so much and no more for transportation of passengers and freight a railroad established and existing under an act or charter of incorporation like a turnpike or a plank road is a public highway but only to be used in a different mode angel on highways p 13 a great jurist of massachusetts has thus stated this elementary principle we think that a turnpike road is a public highway established by public authority for public use and is to be regarded as public easement the only difference between this and a common highway is instead of being made at the public expense at the first instance it is authorized and laid out by public authority and made at the expense of individuals at the first instance and the cost of construction and maintenance is reimbursed by a toll levied by public authority for the purpose every traveler has the same right to use it paying the toll established by law as he would have to do to use any other public highway commonwealth v wilkinson 10 pick p 175 if it was necessary for the protection of the public that the old turnpike road and the frail boat propelled by oars should be under the wise supervision of the law a jurisdiction unquestioned for centuries in order that one individual should not be preferred to another and that all upon the payment of a just and reasonable compensation therefor should receive fair and absolutely impartial treatment with how much more force does the reasoning and the rule apply where the highway by virtue of its vast extent and the carrier by reason of its colossal wealth and power are necessarily vested with a practical monopoly and with infinite capacity for mischief if it betrays or perverts its manifest duty to the thousands of helpless shippers along its right of way as said in tiff v southern rwy co 123 fed rep 789791 it has been from time immemorial the basic obligation of a common carrier to receive and transport all goods offered upon receiving reasonable compensation having undertaken that duty it was settled by the common law that the common carrier must carry for all to the extent of its capacity without unjust or unreasonable discrimination either in charges or in the facilities for actual transportation and further if this was true at common law how much stronger is the obligation upon those vast public corporations of modern times which in consideration of valuable franchises granted by the public are engaged in the stupendous business of transporting freight and passengers so universal is the reliance of the public upon these instrumentalities of modern commerce that their operation is indispensable to the very existence of our modern social life jeremiah black twenty years ago in the greatest effort of his life completely exploded the timeworn sophistry that a corporation can exercise an absolute and unrestricted control over a public highway simply because it may own the means by which that highway is operated he declared in an address delivered before the judiciary committee of the pennsylvania legislature in 1s83 thaton the other hand the corporations deny that they owe any responsibility to the state more than individuals engaged in private business they assert that the management of the railroads being a mere speculation of their own these thoroughfares of trade and travel must be run for their interests without re ard to public right if they take advantage of the power to oppress the labor and overtax the land of the state if they crush the industry of one man or place to build up the prosperity of another if they plunder the rich by extortion or deepen the distress of the poor by discriminating against them they justify themselves by showing that all this was in the way of business that their interest required them to do it that if they had done otherwise their fortunes would not have been so great as they are that it was the prudent proper and successful method of managing their own affairs this is their universal answer to all complaints their protests against legislative intervention to protect the public always take this shape with more or less distinctness of outline in whatever language they clothe their argument it is the same in substance as that with which demetrius the silversmith defended the sanctity of the temple for which he made shrines sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth i aver that a man or corporation appointed to do a public duty must perform it with an eye single to the public interest if he perverts is authority to purposes of private gain he is guilty of corruption and all who aid and abet him are his accomplices in crime he defiles himself if he mingles his own business with that intrusted to him by the government and uses one to promote the other if a judge excuse himself for a false decision by saying that he sold his judgment for the highest price he could get you cover his character with infamy a ministerial officer like a sheriff for instance who extolts from a defendant or even from a conlict in his custody what the law does not allow him to collect and puts the surplus in his pocket is a knave upon whom you have no mercy you send county commissioners to the penitentiary for consulting their own financial advantage to the injury of the general weal when the officers of a city corporation make a business of running it to enrich themselves at the expense of the public you can see at a glance that they are the basest of criminals why then con you not sce that the officers of a railway corporation are equslly guilty when they pervert the authority with which they are clothed to purposes urely selfish a railroad corporation is a part of the clvil government as much as a city corporation the offic6rs of the former as much as the latter are agents and trustees of the public and the public has an interest precisely sioilar in the fidelity of both why then should partiality or extortion be condemned as criminal in one 11 it be tolerated as fair business when practiced by the other i am propounding no new and untried theory the legislatures of nearly every state in this union have in fact long assumed jurisdiction and exercised a control of railroads operating entirely within their boundaries and have in fact named a maximum rate for the carriage of passengers and freight there is one and only one reason why the various state legislatures have never exercised any control over interstate carriers by the terms of the constitution all power over interstate and foreign commerce was expressly delegated to congress now it has been repeatedly decided that congress has complete and exclusive control of interstate carriers the various states did not lose or abandon any part of their power or jurisdiction they simply delegated it they did not and could not invest the federal congress with any greater or less authority than that which they originally exercised then congress is to the common carriers doing an interstate business exactly what the legislatures of the various states are to railroads operating entirely within the several states why the railroads of this country in their effort to escape every character of state supervision have defined enlarged and elucidated this position with a learning and skill i can never hope to emulate they are the people who have preached to every legislature into the ears of every state court into the ears of every complainant that they were the especial wards of the federal government and answerable only to the federal congress for fifty years they have proclaimed the doctrine that they could always take refuge behind the regis of the constitution i say to the common carriers of this country who are kicking and squirming at the prospect of obedience to the provisions of this bill you have appealed to cntsar and to cmsar you must go applause i now strange to say the federal legislature has refused to exercise this authority and the states can not and during several decades the railroads have been practically immune from any restraint state or national and they are the only common carriers in the whole world which are now or ever have been free from any control or supervision state or national absolutely free to charge what they please where they please whom they please and when they please now have the common carriers of this country abused this power it has been anomalous it has been unique it has been tremendous they have been left to work out their own salvation without any restraint for it will be remembered that the wrongs they committed are mal prohibita and not mal in se anld without the aid of statutory enactment the common law as interpreted by the federal courts was helpless to restrain them let us see with their 200 000 miles of railroad with their sixteen billions of dollars of capital they come before the bar of this house do they come with a record that they themselves claim is clean and honest do they come with a story of fair dealing between man and man or between carrier and carrier why gentlemen your very defense of the railroads the men who themselves mbst loudly protest against the exercise of the authority conferred by this bill are the men who admit that they have been continually guilty of secret rebates discriminations and of privatecar abuses and more than one of them have said that such offenses should be punished by imprisonment and a felons stripes and the roads admit they have done these things admit they are guilty of the offenses which their own defenders claim should be a felony oh the railroads say you should give us the right to charge such rates as we please and you should not interfere or fix a maximum freight rate we gave secret rebates it is true but the reason why the privatecar abuse has grown throughout the country is that we were forced to do it we were afraid of the packing companies god help the corporation or the man whose integrity is not proof against his cupidity and his fear let us take for instance the story of these privatecar evils about thirty years ago a shrewd connecticut yankee conceived this idea meats and berries and perishable fruits can be preserved indefinitely in almost all climates under almost all atmospheric conditions if you will give them an even temperature all you have to do is to get a good refrigerator and you can keep for any length of time almost anywhere in this country your meats and your berries and your fruits the idea was sublime in its severe simplicity as all great conceptions are and he determined to put a refrigerator on wheels that was all he went to these wise railroads whom you say know so much more than all the judges and all the courts and commissions and congresses since the day of adam and he proposed that they should build such cars these wise men laughed him to scorn then mr swift said to themfor he was this yankee and at that time poor as a church mouse i will raise the few hundred dollars and build a car myself if you will haul it they said they would haul it from that humble beginning from the genius of a chicago butcher shiping a few thousand pounds of dressed meat in a car of which he was in part the inventor and entirely the promoter within a few years this car system grew this simple method of transporting fruit and vegetables in a moving refrigerator until at the present day one gigantic trust owns so 000 cars the effect of this new means of transporting perishable products was electrical upon all fruit and vegetable producing sections of the country georgia melons were hawked in the streets of new york and north carolina furnished strawberries to the markets of montreal the profits from this novel invention far outstripped the phenomenal growth of the business till at last these 80 000 cars costing only about 700 apiece on an average were actually clearing 324 per annum each in mileage alone to the men who operate them in order to keep their contents at a given temperature these fruit cars are provided with bunkers which are filled with ice by the carriers at stations established atfixed points along their lines at which quantities of ice are stored for that purpose the cost of renewing the ice in these cars is found to be about 2 a ton the private car companies found in this socalled icing charge first an opportunity for wholesale graft and then they employed it as the means of absorbing the entire profit from this greatindustry mr j w midglcy in his testimony before the interstate and foreign commerce committee hearings p 258 in order to illustrate by a special instancethis concealed method of wholesale larcenyhe referred to the fact that armour swift and other big packers had of late gone into the fruit and produce business and he gave abundant instances from his personal experience to show that the packers rapidly were securing absolute control of the commission business of the country that they were able by illegal methods to stifle competition and that private car lines had an improper and unholy alliance with railroad companies out of his personal experience the witness showed that in 1900 the price for icing a car of peaches from michigan to boston was 20 then the armour company secured an exclusive contract for doing all the icing on the pore marquette railroad the armours lmmediately put the price up to 33 and finally to 70 according to the witness armour co proceeded to buy up practically all the peaches in michigan at their own figures because they found it convenient to refuse cars to other shippers or to be unable to ice anything along the line of the pore marquette railroad until after the fruit had rotted thus forcing all competitors out of the field entirely i desire to call the attention of this committee to an instance cited by mr e m furgeson one of the greatest commission merchants in the united states on february 4 1905 hearings page 21 he gave to the committee on interstate and foreign commerce a still more striking proof of the manner in which these commercial brigands divide their pluder secretly wrung from a long suffering and victimized public says mr furgeson in the following year 1903 the grand rapids and indiana and grand trunk were won over and taken into the secret compact then and there ended the commercial freedom of the grand rapids fruit industry and all shippers but one at that point are now yielding up tribute to the system one shipper there who happened to own 30 refrigerator cars that he had operated for years on the mileage basis alone was at first denied the privilege of using his own cars in making shipments but in order that this shipper might not become troublesome as his protests indicated he might this shipper was privileged to use his own cars in making shipments to his customers on one condition only to wit that he become a party to the secret compact and agree to charge his customers the armour rate which the railway companies kindly offered to bill as advance charges against all shipments so made collect from the consignee at the destination and rebate this shipper the difference between the armour charges collected and the actual cost of ice based upon the total amount used at the rate of 2 per ton in the bunkers and it will be noted in this case that the railway company undertook to do the icing itself or rather arranged for its being done by the connecting lines over which the shipments might travel it will be remembered that these same refrigerator cars costing as i have said about 700 apiece each clear on an average 324 per annum in mileage alone to their owners the icing charges are more remunerative in the fruit cars than the mileage the railroads are forced to make all necessary repairs so you have each of these cars practically paying for itself in a year when we consider the effect of this privatecar abuse upon the vast cattle interests of this country and the cold conscienceless plunder of eighty million of people who have been forced to pay tribute to these bandits upon every pound of meat consumed the wonder is not that there is today a demand for relief froml ocean to ocean but that a long suffering and patient people have endured this outrage so long six gigantic packing housesarmour co swift co morris co the national packing company schwarzschild sulzberger and the cudahy packing companytoday fix the price of every steer every hog every sheep slaughtered in the united states and then they hold an iron monopoly upon every pound of beef and mutton and pork consumed by the american people from a total of less than 7 000 000 cattle slaughtered in 1903 5 521 697 passed through the hands of this allcontrolling combine commonly known as the big six and the following statement prepared by an able and conservative expert tells the sad story of multiplied millions wrung from the hungry mouth of helpless toil mr cuthbert powell of kansas city makes the following estimate based on one years records in great western packing houses native steers on the hoof average 1 205 pounds and dressing 58 per cent in killing make each 700 pounds of clear meat they sell in the kansas city markets for 4j cents a pound at which the live weight cost is 57 23 beef 700 pounds at 7j cents 52 50 hides average value 7 32 fats average value 5 56 offal average value 2 26 07 64 deduct liveweight cost 57 23 cost of killing 50 general expenses of plant 2 50 60 23 profit 7 41 mr powell says applying the average profit of 7 41 on cattle 20 cents on hogs 50 cents on sheep and 50 cents on calves to the total number of head killed in a year by the combine packing houses gives a total profit of 47 727 412 figuring upon the total capitalization undoubtedly heavily watered of 110 500 000 we have 43 per cent profit on the stock the greatest trust in the world by chas edward russell pp 161162 a few years ago and the great northwest with its vast plains and mountain ranges extending from the mississippi to the pacific ocean was one illimitable cattle ranch the prosperity and happiness of multiplied millions of sturdy farmers and ranchmen was absolutely dependent upon this great industry today this broad empire has been literally enveloped in the tentacular coils of a remorseless octopus and strangled to death in three years ending january 1 1905 the value of beef cattle in the united states declined 163 000 000 the ranchman of the west at the mercy of the beef trust like the tobacco planter of kentucky and tennessee under the domination of the american tobacco company found but one purchaser for his product all competition was destroyed and cattle were sold year after year at less than the cost of production as is always the case the farmer rendered destitute like a blind samson in the temple brought the whole superstructure down upon his head every other business felt in its very vitals the effect of the ruin which had been visited upon the tiller of the soil in iowa alone in the years 19034 there were 32 bank failures involving the loss of millions to depositors the banks had loaned to the cattle raisers and they had been devoured by the beef trust conditions in iowa are but illustrative of the wholesale disaster which was thus visited upon that whole country mr charles edward russell who has given this subject the most exhaustive investigation thus describes the scope of this monster monopoly which has sprung up almost in a night and now threatens the peace and prosperity of a nation of some of the most important industries of this country it has an absolute ironclad infrangible monopoly of others it has a control that for practical purposes of profit not less complete it fixes at its own will the price of every pound of flesh salted smoked or preserved meat prepared and gold in the united states it fixes the price of every ham every pound of bacon every pound of lard every can of prepared soup it has an absolute monopoly of our enormous meat exports dressed and preserved it has an absolute monopoly of the american trade in fertilizers hides bristles horn and bone products it owns or controls or dominates every slaughterhouse except a few that have inconsiderable local or special trade it owns steam and electric railroads it owns the entire trolley car systems in several cities and is acquiring the like property elsewhere it owns factories shops stock yards mills land and land companies plants warehouses politicians legislators and congressmen it defies wall street and all that therein is it terrorizes great railroad corporations long used to terrorizing others it takes toll from big and little it gouges millions from railroad companies and cent pieces from obscure shippers today it is compelling a lordly railroad to dismiss its general manager tomorrow it is black listing and ruining some little commission merchant it is remorseless tireless greedy insatiable and it plans achievements so much greater than any so far recorded in the history of commerce that the imagination flags in trying to follow its future possibilities the greatest trust in the world p 2 it is not to be expected that any such an opportunity for exploitation and plunder was to be overlooked by that international outlaw the standard oil company like the beef trust and the fruit transportation companies it made all its shipments of oil in its own private cars now these great concerns formed a daring design which has no peer or parallel either in the annals of business or larceny they determined not only to fleece the public but to hold up the railroad companies themselves with their 80 000 private cars like the tank lines of the standard oil company they determined to use this vast quantity of freight as a huge club to beat the transportation companies into submission to their inordinate demands notwithstanding the fact that the carriers controlled and operated over 200 000 miles of railway aggregating in value over 16 000 000 000 the combine had the routeing of these cars absolutely at their own disposal they could say over just what road they would ship the whole or any part of them they first demanded that there should be no charge for hauling their empty cars then the system of secret rebatesthe deadly hidden power to destroy all competitionthen more mileage till at last the roads were forced to pay for the privilege of hauling these private cars loaded or empty threequarters of a cent a mile on each car from all points east of chicago one cent a mile west of chicago as far as el paso albuquerque and ogden and threequarters of a cent the rest of the westward haul the roads protested then came the threat all our business goes to a rival line meet these terms or you haul not a car or a pound of this immense traffic and in every case the roads surrendered then they demanded that the roads should keep the cars in repair and forced the concession at last came that crowning iniquity the icing charge by which the road furnished ice at 2 a ton and the combine made such charges for that same ice as their cupidity dictated demanding the last dime which could be wrung from the plundered shipper then the final crowning infamy that these charges should be concealed as part of the freight charge and where the shipper refused to be plunder6d to be collected in advance or further shipments would be refused thus blackmailing their hapless victims into compliance thus they played upon the cupidity of the most eager and greedy organizations in all the world they said watch the hangman hang and they arrayed railroad against railroad robber against robber thus were the betrayers of the public in turn themselves betrayed they said to one railroad you must give us this advantage or you get none of the traffic in their eagerness to secure the carriage of these 80 000 cars the railroads themselves basely surrendered to the owners of these private car companies basely agreed to conceal the robbery they were perpetrating upon the american people basely agreed that their waybills should become the foul cloak of the most gigantic system of robbery ever known since bandits ceased to go about with mace and mail and now they come to us whining that we had to do the stealing or the other fellow would have gotten our trade

unanimous voice of the people and an almost unitedeffort of this house to save the industries of this country the gentleman from pennsylvania has compared the endeavor of the public servants of the american people to stop this robbery with that foul plot which culminated in the crucifixion of my god he has compared an agreement made in the open day and approved by the president of the united states with a secret conspiracy concocted between a cowardly roman pretor and a murderous jewish priest i quote his exact words i heard expressed today by a gentleman who served on the interstate and foreign commerce committee a profound regret that the gentlemen could not agree among themselves they are all agreed upon one issue i do not want to repeat myself but i can recollect a similar instance when there was an agreement between men about the time that one of the greatest wrongs was perpetrated that ever was perpetrated in human history and it is recorded in these words and pilate and herod were made friends from that day i want to say to you gentlemen on that side of the house that the figure may have some propriety there but i thank god there is no consciencestricken pilate here washing his hands of this legislation on the democratic side if you want to carry the simile further i will do it pass this law and execute it rigorously against the railroads and the privatecar companies alike and we will have two more thieves on the cross now they admit that the legislature has the right to control common carriers they do not attempt to show that we are atraining any constitutional power not one of them they do not say it is unconstitutional they dare not as lawyers say it is unconstitutional but they say it is unwise why the people have been robbed millions have been filched the trust alone receives 72 000 a day from its privatecar lines over 50 000 000 a year is being taken alone in icing charges and rebates you all admit that trusts and monopolies are the curse and the menace of the age and i here and now declare there is not a single insatiate and lawdefying combination of capital in all the land that does not owe its being growth and power to one or both of those twin iniquities alike in operation and in principlea secret rebate and a protective tariff why you take iowa ohio illinois and indiana they talk so much about them and in those four great states the population in the country has actually decreased during the last ten years where is your boasted cattle interest of the west dead the west is full of bank failures in the face of your boasted prosperity why in every part of it is the sad story of defalcation and bankruptcy the price of cattle has continually gone down and the price of beef at the same time has gone up the consumer has suffered and the producer has suffered whenever you deprive the american laborer of his beef whenever you say he shall not eat meat you have reduced him to the very condition which you claim obtains in europe for the european laborer is unable to eat beef it is that meat that gives vigor to the army it is that meat that gives power to the mechanic it is because we are building up a nation of meat eaters we are able to dominate the world and yet you admit the price of cattle has gone down in three years from 51 cents to 4 cents while dressed beef has increased in the same proportion at the same time nothing but a trust can produce such a result it is abnormal it is absolutely impossible to account for it under any law of supply and demand it is the throttling of supply and the domination of demand that does it you learned lawyers 1 want to call your attention to one thing no man from the west has raised his voice against this bill no man from the south has raised his voice against this bill the gentleman from maine protests against it the gentleman from massachusetts protests against it the gentleman from pennsylvania protests against it we have much to learn from those three wise men of the east do they tell us it is unconstitutional no do they tell us that we are violating any basic principle of law no the gentleman from maine says all my god you can not afford to do it because bryan is not dead and the country is full of populists why the gentleman from massachusetts that learned gentleman compares us to hyenas and bears and hounds"], [0.08461952209472656,

open for amendment the day after tomorrow there will be little or no debate permitted by those having this measure in charge the bill i am informed is going to be rushed through the houserailroaded as it wereregardless of its defects and its omissions and its incompleteness and all amendments that members desire to offer to strengthen the measure are to be quickly voted down and the bill just as it came from the committee passed on to the tender mercies of the sacrific senate in my opinion this matter of just and reasonable railroad rates and the governmental regulation of transportation companies doing an interstatecommerce business is one of the most important questions now before the american people it is a live question and no matter what we do now or say now you know and i know that it is here to stay until 1 906 218 1 it is settled and settled right and the problem never will be solved aud the issue will never down until it is solved and settled for the best interest of all the people and not in the interest of the selfish few i have given much careful study to this great subject i know something about it as a legislator trying my best to do my duty as i see it to all the people i have given and will continue to give my very best efforts to help in the solution of the many problems we are called upon in these matters to determine and they should be solved and determined by us in a spirit of fairness and equality and equity to all concerned the highways of commerce the avenues of industry the byways of trade must be open to all and every shipper and every producer must be treated exactly alikeno midnight tariffs no rebates no discriminations and no favoritism equal rights to all and special privileges to none must be our watchword now sir we all realize i believe that the great intdrstatetransportation agencies of our country are here to stay they are essential to the business of the country they can not be dispensed with nor destroyed they are as fixed in our commercial life as the hours of the day and as immutable in our industrial existence as the medium of exchange their mileage and their equipment and their wealth and their power and their influence will not diminish but will increase more and more as the years come and go they will continue to doninate the people if the people do not take action to control and to regulate them the people of the country are aroused on this question they will keep up the fight until it is won you can beat the people today you can deceive the people tonorrow but the contest between right and wrong will go on and sooner or later the people will win i ia with the people in this fight it is either government regulation now or government ownership hereaftertake your choice as the president said on this subject in his message to the congress in december 1904 the government must in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the railways engaged in interstate commerce and such increased supervision is the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the other i read not long ago that more than 80 per cent of the enormous railroad mileage which today gridirons the united states has been constructed since the civil war we have over 215 000 miles of main railroad tracks and the giant spider is still spreading its web of steel in every and all directions and when we take into consideration the second third and fourth tracks and sidings and terminals thetotal foots up to nearly 300 000 miles of steel railroad tracks just think of that sufficient to go twelve times around the earth or inmike a journey to the moon if such a thing were possible and have miles and miles to spare we are indeed the greatest railroad country on earth and will continue to be for a century to come and if we pause to consider these marvelous figures and facts we must be impressed with the consciousness of the farreaching power and effect of the railway influence in every line of human industry and if we stop to analyze the volume of traffic handled we can not fail to realize how greatly the railway systems of our country enter into every phase of modern life in 1894 the railroads carried 638 000 000 tons of freight in 1904 the figures more than doubled and reached the enormous total of 1 309 000 000 tons with aggregate traffic earnings amounting to the enormous total of 1 977 638 713 last year they did a largely increased business and the figures for 1906 will greatly exceed those of last year in 1895 the records show that 527 421 000 passengers were carried in 1904 the figures increased to 715 419 000 and when the reports for last year are at hand a much larger increase will be evident the figures are bewildering and the facts as startling as they are astonishing and the end is not yet to transport this vast number of passengers and gigantic amount of freight including all varieties of foodstuffs there were utilized 47 000 engines 40 000 passenger cars and 1 760 000 freight cars in the operation of this great network of railways more than 1 250 000 men are directly employed of which 52 000 are engine drivers 55 000 firemen 40 000 conductors and 106 000 trainmen of course i know figures are usually uninteresting but these figures are alive with human interest and full of flesh and blood activity because they have to do not only with men and measures but also with our national commercial life and our fundamental political and industrial institutions which should safeguard the interests of all the peoplebut more often do notand the home life and the very existence of every man who works for a livelihood and earns his bread in the sweat of his face the rapid growth of our interstate commoncarrier systems during the past quarter of a century has been simply marvelous and the tremendous power they wield today in the intimate political and social and economic life of the country is truly inconceivable the average man who rides on a railroad train in comfort and in luxury to a distant point has little conception of how the railway affects even the most intimate details of his existence it is the power that dictates political conventions and makes nominations that seats its wellpaid lawyers in the courts of justice that rules legislatures that subsidizes the press that dominates the national congress and that compels all of us who must eat to maintain life to pay the price for food which the big transportation interests fix directly or indirectly from a systematic investigation of existing conditions and a careful examination of governmental statistics i fearlessly assert that the time is now at hand when the government must take decisive action to regulate the great railways and great public transportation utilities of the country doing an interstatecommerce business or they will ere long absolutely own and control the government and through their great tentacles stretching out in every direction they will be able to strangle competition crush commercial endeavor paralyze individual industrialism and create the trust of all trusts and the monopoly of all monopolies these giant public utility transportation companies traversing as they do every part of our national domain are so vital a part of our complex industrial and economical and political life that their influence affects all things which go to make up our existence from day to day i believe the people are just awakening to the consciousness of the real facts and the true situation and in the study of the problem of the cost of living are finding out for themselves what recent economic writers have shown conclusively and that is how the control and the power and the operation of railroads in this country overshadow every other factor of human existence and so sir knowing what i do about the facts and the conditions and feeling as i do on this subject i welcome remedial legislation and shall favor any bill that will correct the abuses and remedy the evils incident to the subjectmatter now under consideration i have carefully listened to the several clever speeches which have been delivered during the consideration of this measure these brilliant forensic efforts however have failed to my mind to greatly illumine the subject or to impart to us very much valuable information the time consumed in this debate nevertheless may not have been altogether wasted far from it but it does seem to me strange that no two members who have discussed the bill agree as to just what it means and as to just what it will do in justice to myself i want to say that i do not agree with all that has been said in favor of the pending bill and neither do i concur in all that has been said against the bill we all appear to agree that the measure under consideration is not a perfect bill intended to remedy every evil incident to the subjectmatter i do not think that even its distinguished author for whose abilities in these matters i have great admiration will seriously assert such a claim take this bill all in all and the best that can be claimed for it in my judgment is that it is only a feeble effort to correct in a doubtful way and to a limited degree longstanding and patent and glaring abuses will the bill in its present shape even do this i indulge the hope that it will to some extent and if it does it will accomplish something and believing that it will do some good that it will remedy some evils that it will correct some abuses i shall vote for the bill because with all its faults with all its doubts with all its omissions with all its defects i sincerely hope and i want to honestly believe that it is a step in the right directiona legislative advancea congressional stride forward along right lines for the benefit of the many against the selfish interests of the few now as i said there are some things about this bill that i do not like and that i would change if i could have my way i trust i will be forgiven by the sponsors of the bill if i indulge in a few criticisms of the measure and by way of suggestion point out some glaring defects that should be cured by amendment to make the legislation more effective the bill is a long one but not a very comprehensive measure it is an amendment to the interstatecommerce act and purports to enlarge the powers of the interstate commerce commission the committee reporting the bill generously admit that in its preparation they were aided by the study of all the bills introduced by members on this subject and i want to say that i introduced at the beginning of this session what i believe to be a bill in the right direction a bill that i seriously believe if enacted into law would to a very great extent effectually put a stop to railroad rebates and transportation discriminations it is a short bill and a simple bill and a comprehensive bill i do not know what consideration it received from the committee reporting the bill before us but i do know that if it were a part of the law not a transportation company in the land would dare violate its provisions because if it did the doors of a felons jail would open to receive the officials of the company granting the rebate or discrimination as well as the shipper receiving the gratuity and the favoritism i have no vanity in the matter i am seeking results for the best interests of all the people i do not claim perfection for my bill like some of the zealous advocates of the pending bill claim for the measure now before us but i do claim that my bill to say the least will go very far toward the serious solution of the many problems confronting us and in my opinion have a beneficial tendency to correct present interstate transportation abuses i believe that one of the greatest evils complained about in all these matters is the rebate abuse by which an unjust discrimination is made between shippers and a rebate given back to one shipper or to several shippers which all the others must contribute to by paying an exorbitant rate thisbill sir which i introduced to amend the interstatecommerce act and which is referred to in the report of the committee would in my opinion effectually put a stop to rebates by making the rebate if one is given the maximum ratethat is to say the rate paid minus the rebate would stand as the highest rate if this bill were a law i am satisfied that no railroad or other transportation company could give a rebate without the fact being quickly found out by some shipper who was discriminated against and just as soon as the fact of the rebate was established the commission would fix the rate charged minus the rebate as the maximum rate i believe if some provision of that kind were put in the bill now under consideration with a criminal penalty clause for its violation it would effectually do away with rebates but i would go further in this matter and make it a felony for any official connected with a railroad company or other transportation system doing an interstate commerce business to grant a rebate or for any shipper over the line to receive a rebate if this were the law i am satisfied there would be no more rebates and that the evil would cease for all time to come we should make the punishment fit the crime and if we do i believe there will be no more railroad rebates put in the bill a provision making the giving or the receiving of a rebate a criminal offense punishable by a long term of imprisonment and i say to the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and to the members of this house and i say to the country that there would not be a railroad or interstate transportation company that would give a rebate and no shipper would dare receive a rebate for love or money you will never stop this iniquitous system of rebate favoritism and discrimination until you point to the prison doors if this bill were intended to carry out the recommendations of the president it would contain a provision of this kind and the problem so far as secret rebates are concerned would be solved and you never again would hear a shipper complain about a railroad or any other great publicutility transportation company doing an interstatecommerce business giving a secret rebate but here we have the unanimous report the concentrated wisdom of all the members of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce and after laboring industriously for a year they bring forth this remarkable document this bill of twentysix long pages of uncertain phrases that a philadelphia lawyer can not comprehend and which i undertake to say if placed on the statute books in its present shape and ultimately held to be constitutional will not accomplish the purpose desired by the people of the country who have been complaining for the last quarter of a century against these unjust and unreasonable rates these railroad favoritisms and these interstate transportation discriminations i can demonstrate it i think in a very few words if the gentlemen interested will glance at page 11 of this bill section 15 they will find there what may aptly be termed the weak link in the chain of this measure on page 11 line 5 section 15 the bill prescribes the procedure of the commission to fix and establish a fair and just and reasonable rate then follows this significant language that such order shall go into effect thirty days after notice to the carrier and shall remain in force and be observed by the carrier unless mark the language here is what i believe to be the little joker in this bill unless tho same shall be suspended or modified or set aside by the commission or suspended or modified or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction here is the committees little black man this is the africanin the railroad wood pile can these words be misunderstood i think not i believe the railroads of the land and their lawyers are aware of their significance i believe they know the import of this section and i want to submit in all candor to the railroad lawyers of the country how they interpret these words in the last line to wit or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction they know now what these words mean i think i know what they mean but the people who want railroadrate legislation will find out later what they mean the word suspended if i am not mistaken is used in this section of the bill advisedly and it was put in there to baffle the efforts of those most anxious to accomplish something for the relief of the shippers of the country from unjust railroad rates and discriminations i am aware that the word suspended has a wellknown definition i am inclined to believe however that some of us just now fail to grasp the real significance of the word but if this bill becomes a law in its present shape those now crying at the doors of congress for relief against railroad extortion will soon find out the fatality and the significance of the word su8pended then some of us will be suspended by our trusting constituents the whole object sought by this remedial legislation may hang on this ominous word suspended and when the poor and injured shipper complains to the interstate commerce commission created by this bill consisting of seven members hereafter to be appointed for a term of seven years at an annual salary of 10 000and i can imagine the struggle of the railroads to get just the right kind of men on this new commissionwhen the shipper makes his complaint and the commission fixes the ratethat is to say makes its order establishing a fair and just and reasonable ratei can see in my minds eye the temporary joy of the shipper until the railroad lawyer rushes into court and during the thirty days allowed gets an injunction suspending the order of the commission and then what is the poor shipper to do why go on paying the old railroad rate just the same as before that is the way it will be done let us for the sake of argument assume a case and follow it to its logical end this bill in its present shape becomes a law the new commission we will assume has been appointed and a shipper who has been discriminated against for years or who has been injured by rebates who has been getting poorer and poorer while some other favored shipper who has been profiting by his misfortunes is getting richer and richer makes complaint before the commission and establishes that the rate he is paying is unjust the commission on all the testimony adduced is satisfied his complaint is justified and thereupon makes an order fixing a just and reasonable rate that order will not go into effect for thirty days and before it can go into effectthat is during the thirty days if the order is not satisfactory to the railroad companythe railroad lawyer will go into a court of competent jurisdiction and get an injunction suspending the order then the shipper will have to pay the old extortionate rate and if he wants to fight the matter he must hire an experienced lawyer to carry the case up on appeal and before the court of last resort adjudicates the matter between the railroad company and the shipper to see whether an injustice has been done or not the shippers business will be suspended or in the hands of a receiver and unless the shipper is a welltodo and a shrewd and a sagacious and a pertinacious business man he will be suspended ere the final judgment of the case in the united states supreme court with all due respect to the erudite authors and distinguished sponsors of the pending bill i am inclined to think that this provision can be materially changed for the better by an amendment i shall suggest if the bill becomes a law in its present shape i am afraid it will accomplish very little of lasting benefit to the shippers and producers of the country and will have a tendency to cause endless delay and interninable litigation and perhaps be the means of defeating the very object desired and sought to be accomplished i am in earnest about this iuatter i want to be fair i do not want to create discord i have no desire to find fault i shall not be captious in my criticism of the pending bill i am in favor of it but i want to make it effectuali want to make it really reach the evils involved and permanently cure them in the speediest possible way i am with the people in this railroad fight for justice i have great personal regard for the distinguished chairman of the conimitteereporting this bill but i would be false to myself and to this great cause if i did not honestly say that i believe that he and all the members of the committee could have presented to this house under all the circumstances a very much better bill and i trust i will be pardoned if i am impelled by my sense of duty and my conception ot the gravity of the situation and the importance of the subjectmatter to i oint out in the kindliest way some of the serious defects some of the glaring errors and what i consider after all the vital weakness of the pending measure hence i regret to say that i can not and i do not altogether agree with some of my colleagues who are congratulating themselves and the committee on the unanimity of the report in favor of this measure and that the bill in its present shape is going to pass the house by a practically unanimous vote it is true that the bill comes before the house with a most harmonious report but a unanimous report from a committee on an important piece of legislation like this against great centralized corporate interests is not an evidence to my mind that the bill is a perfect measure and a complete remedy for existing evils as an old and experienced legislator having served for some time in two capitals it is my opinion that in a great many instances where the report of a committee is unanimous in favor of a bill especially a bill of such great magnitude as the one under consideration which affects so many intrenched and powerful interests and which has met with so much opposition heretofore from the very interests affectedi say that the unanimity is susceptible to the construction that the bill is so drawn that somebody is going to be fooled i do not know whether it will be those who want this legislation or those who do not want it but i am inclined to think that if this bill becomes a law in its present shape that those who want it will be to say the least disappointed i believe that if the great interstate transportation companies were opposed to this bill their power and their influence would be so farreaching that there would be a great deal more opposition to the bill than at present is evident it is a fair assumption to believe that if the railroads of this country were opposed to this bill the measure would not meet with a practically unanimous vote in the house of representatives i do not want to go into details it is unnecessary for me to elaborate the proposition i have no desire to be a carping critic far be it from me to disturb the placid waters existing at present in this body of course i assume that the great transportation companies of the country have felt for some time that the demands of the people for the enforcement of the laws for the abolition of rebates and for more just and reasonable railway rates would have to be acceded to sooner or later and perhaps they are willing to accept this weak and doubtful measure rather than run the risk of further arousing public indignation and the enactment of more drastic legislation to curb the power of these great interstate transportation companies everyone familiar with the subject is aware of the fact that for years there have been secret rebates and unlawful discriminations by railroad companies and other transportation corporations to favored shippers these discriminations and these favoritisms are criminal and must be stopped and if the laws on the statute book now are not strong enough to put a stop to them then we must make new laws rigid enough to put an end to them in this country forever whether this bill will stop them or not i do not now undertake to say but i do hope that the bill will be materially amended ere it becomes a law with the object of more effectually stopping them i know of no greater injustice to the producers of our country than to have a transportation company give a rebate to one shipper at the expense of all the others there should be no favoritism the rate should be the same for all shippers and for all producers equal rates equal rights and equal opportunities for all should be the rule but we know the higtory of the past and we do know of many cases where one shipper has been favored at the expense of all the other shippers until the favored shipper controlled the product or the industry drove out of business every competitor and ultimately secured a complete monopoly if you will read the testimony which has been adduced in several investigations heretofore held at the instance of the government you will readily comprehend the truth of this proposition but i do not care at this time to go into details or to be too critical i am an optimist and not a pessimist i hope for the best and i trust the bill will be materially amended and become a law and accomplish some good i shall do my best to improve the bill by amendments if they will be permitted but i can not refrain now from telling what i actually believe and to voice my convictions and say that the bill in its present shape is not satisfactory to the real friends of federal regulation it is a good deal of a makeshift it is weak it is apologetic and the railroads are not opposing it that putv me on inquiry the unanimity with which it is going through this house also lends color to the suspicion that the railway interests of the country see no danger in its wishywashy provisions it looks to me as if the fight for a square deal from the railroads is far from won and the friends of rate reform and governmental regulation of interstate transportation companies must keep up the fight and fight harder than ever it is apparent to me that if this bill were intended to compel the railroads to live up to the law now on the statute books if it were a bill to force the transportation companies to give fair and just and reasonable rates to every producer and to every shipper you would find these halls filled with railroad lawyers and transportation lobbyists protesting against the passage of the bill and i am frank to say that the bill would not meet with so very little opposition but i have not heard of a railroad protesting against the passage of this bill i have yet to learn of a transportation company sending to the house objections to the enactment of this legislation and i have not seen nor heard of a single railroad lawyer who has been sent here to argue against the progress of the bill and so as i say i am inclined to be doubtful as to the effectiveness of the remedy proposed in the pending measure"], [0.09139752388000488, 0.9086024761199951, 1, "yes and i will admit that somebody just as competent as you are or as i am can come to congress from our country and we are not here

and i may say that it is not the life that the average member of congress should follow long unless he expects to do otherwise than walk home or ride on a passand i hope to god they will stop the latter before we get away from here so gentlemen we are called on now to vote for a bill that continues the cause of this condition that continues the condition that makes the trouble continues alive as it were the germ that is causing the disease which the legislative doctors are here treating without putting one ounce of extermination into the bill the reason why they do not put some limitation into the billthe reason why they havent done it heretoforeis because they say we can not pass it in other words we can not pass a law to prevent a min from holding office in a department as long as he lives or until he gets to be 70 years of age and is unable to run the office what is the matter pressure are we afraid gentlemen i have never seen the da yet when the time comes that i shall act the moral coward toward the great people i have the honor to represent in a humble way before i shall shirk from responsibility for fear of adverse pressure at the ballot box whether that responsibility

credentials without stain or taint to the great people who sent me here go to either of the departments and you will find men who will talk to you in whispers and say that something ought to be done

you dont put something fnto the statute to prevent the condition coining along again of course it will continue like banqaos ghost it wil not down because you dont remove the cause why look at it look at what the gentleman from georgia said yesterday nobody disputes it he says that mir ware the commissioner of pensions from kansas a gentleman and an old soldier himself said that he could not turn

argument avail the edict has gone forth that the bill must pass individual opinion on that side of the chamber is coereced by the thumbscrews of the republican machine to amend or in any way improve the measure will not be tolerated the leaders of the dominant party are evidently in great straits in their attempt to hold the popular confidence and at the same time to keep failh with the political pilferers who live and flourish by class legislation and are now clamoring for cam paign promises to be redeemed they hope by this bill to inaugurate a system of plunder that will take hold of our ocean transportation facilities and under the fostering care of the republican party gain such strength that it can not be uprooted but will continue like the oppressive and unjust discriminations in our socalled protectivetariff system i when the exploiters of the treasury get their hands into its vaults they never willingly withdraw them but by specious pretense and corrupt influence go deeper and deeper even to their very armpits the only hope that this bill will not pass at this session is that perhaps the rush at this late hour by the party management in this house may be only a hypocritical effort to evince a desire to enact the coveted legislation knowing it will not get through the senate the hope to avoid this enactment rests in the cunning of those controlling the action of congressthe republican leaders by making a plausible effort but not passing the bill is to retain this leverage on the adipose tissue of the fattened favorites of corporate monopoly to secure extra contributions for the campaign fund next year thus infamy will be thwarted by hypocrisy and public pelf by duplicitous chicanery those recognizing the evils of this measure should not however rely on the senate it has already passed a shipsubsidy bill of which this is a substitute it might accept the substitute and thus enact the law if the people have any real friends on that side of the chamber i appeal to them to show it now the bounties given by this bill are an admitted subsidy the only plausible argument for it is to overcome artificial barriers to shipbuilding in this country and the artificial disadvantages of our merchant marine it is an attempt by subsidies from our treasury to compensate for the wrongs that class favoritism has inflicted on our industries and commerce that we may build ships in america let us free the material for building them from the fetters of the dingley tariff act that we may have a merchant marine let us cut the bonds of iniquitous legislation that now bind and strangle our commerce we can not make a remedy by piling wrong upon wrong and injustice upon injustice we should correct the evil by repealing unjust and discriminating laws and returning to just regulations and natural conditions we have the best material for building ships in the greatest quantity and most convenient locations but the price of it is inflated by enormous tariff duties and evergrowing and absorbing monopolies our mines our forests and mills furnish the foreigner cheap shipbuilding material but you deny to our own citizens the natural advantageous resources of the country and forbid the pursuit of occupations for which our people are so admirably fitted if the tariff on material necessary for shipbuilding is not a revenue producer but monopolistic and prohibitive why not remove or reduce it why do you not give our citizens desiring to build ships the products of our iron mines cheaper than to the foreigner across the ocean because the steel trust tells you not to do it why do you not let americans procure the products of our forests cheaper than aliens living thousands of miles away because the lumber trust says you nmust not why is it that our own people can not have the privilege of purchasing the necessary material for building ships in the markets of the world at home as well as abroad free from the oppression and exactions of monopoly and tariff discrimination because the trusts in the united states are in league with the republican party and you dare not offend corporate monopoly on whose bounty you exist and by whose power alone you can hope to retain control of this government if you will not let our people build ships why not let them buy ships and own them like other property is it because the protected interests forbid you to thus expose to the public gaze the iniquity by which shipbuilding is discouraged and prevented in this country if we were permitted to buy ships and use them without hindrance under the american flag the reason why we can not now profitably build them would become so apparent to the public that the oppressive tariff rates would be changed and monopoly would receive a violent blow applause you or rather your moneyed masters are determined this shall not happen many of our tariff schedules are prohibitive in amount of duty thus producing no revenue yet they stand as a wall to keep out foreign trade the unjust exactions of the tariffcreated trusts operate to the detriment of our trade in other countries foreign governments resent our oppressive and unnecessary regulations and retaliate by unfriendly tariffs and prohibitive regulations against our products under such conditions how can we build up a merchant marine real trade is necessary for commerce there must be an exchange of goods and this exchange must be mutually profitable or commerce is wellnigh impossible subsidies are always objects of suspicion they are usually impolitic and nearly always dishonest they have another peculiarity their advocates always claimnthat a subsidy is not a subsidy but it is necessary to pay for some sort of service that is desirable in the interest of the public and yet every man that they can persuade to vote for such a measure such as what they now call a subsidy for the southern railroad is claimed by them as an ally who must thereafter vote for anything that has the name of subsidy i am glad i am one of the number of those who have never voted for any such provision at any time yet i remember it was claimed by the advocates of the appropriation for the benefit of the southern railroad that that was not a subsidy but was a proper compensation for reasonable services and was a benefit to the people all through the southern states if that claim was true then the pay was proper and the subsidy as you call it now ought to have been given"], [0.0955730676651001, 0.9044269323348999, 1, "the reason they do not is because the railroads have recently taken away their passes their power in pennsylvania is so great they have grown independent and now show the contempt they have long felt for the politicians and public officials of pennsylvania i take pennsylvania as only an instance i was showing the strength of this system in that practically solid republican state the constitution says that public officers shall not ride on passes and merely because there is no law making a penalty it has been overridden by the people who hold the offices in that state and would continue to be overridden were it not that the railroads drunk with power and nauseated with disgust have kicked them out and taken away their muchloved passes what an object lesson for patriots to study as i am speaking on the power of this system let us take the democratic state of texas here we find another object lesson the last four democratic platforms of that state have declared for anantifreepass law the last four legislatures were elected solidly democratic and yet the law has not been passed by any one of them because their pockets are full of passes and their hearts full of desire for privilege what other reason can be assigned it is not altogether a question of whether you are a democrat or a republican it is the system based on a power that appeals to the selfishness and greed of man that i am fighting it is a system that has grown up so broad so great and so shameless that it is a national disgrace what effect does it have it debauches the public service and poisons the fountains of justice if any corporation asking special legislation should give money to any member and it was known that would be considered a disgrace and would suggest crime we have a law against bribery the law against bribery denounces the doing or not doing some specific official act for pay but is not a gift with intent to influence the congress or the court a bribe in conscience you may employ a lawyer by the case or by the year you may bribe an officer as to one thing or as to everything bribery is specific gifts are generalthe same in principle a man that receives 500 in money from the pennsylvania railroad for instance would be looked upon as a bribe taker but the man who receives 5 000 worth of privileges that are equal exactly equal to money itself is considered a respectable gentleman and by himself perhaps it is considered that he does not violate any of the amenities or any of the proprieties of his official position the time has come in the history of this country when not foreign powers but people who are part of our own government those corporations those monopolies those institutions that have been built up on special privilege and wish to run this country and many say they are running it are sustaining this system there is no question about the fact these people pay your way to your homes and from your home to your convention and pay the way of your friends and supporters to the conventions the men who will vote for measures for the railroads and the other corporations that they want to favor can get passes franks etc without limit the companies give to all who will receive and they get a return for it do they not our laws and decisions fully answer the question when some of the members of this house who were riding upon passes voted for the eschtownsend bill in the fiftyeighth congress their passes on the january following were refused them because they voted against the will of the railroads this is true according to the statement that was openly and notoriously published all over the united states and never so far as i know has been denied i believe it to be a fact because there has not been a denial that shows not only i think to every man in this house but to everyone in this country that the railroads are seeking to influence and control your action as servants of the people by the system of valuable gifts the giving and receiving of such gifts ought to be denounced by law the offenders put in the penitentiary and prohibited from holding public office any man who will receive a favor knowing that the intention is to corrupt him no matter how incorruptible he may think himself ought not to occupy a position of honor or trust representing the people in a popular government we should put the stamp of disapproval on this system and blot it out by law i appeal toevery patriotic member and i hope that includes nearly all in this house to work as a unit to force the passage of this bill why should the speaker by his power why should the republican machine in this body why should the chairman of this committee and some of the republican memhers of it control our action why should they refuse to let this salutary measure be voted on which is in the interest of the people and for the honor of the congress and the courts in this connection i will cite the testimony of some other prominent men the following axe extracts from a recent publication by col r e cowart of dallas tex it is all wrong it is simply infamous these free passes are granted by the railroads for important business political and commercial reasons it is the most powerful weapon they have a friend of mine recently related to me a conversation he heard in 1886 between governor throckmorton of texas governor brown of tennessee and the late col george noble who was then general superintendent of the texas and pacific railroad they were discussing the civil war when governor brown remarked that our civil war was unavoidable and could not have been prevented any more than could the french revolution colonel noble begged leave to differ and said that if a great popular upheaval like the french revolution were to break out now and the government would give him control of all the railroads in the nation and allow him to issue all the free passes he desired he would guarantee under heavy bond to suppress the revolution in three weeks there is a climate of opinion and morality a hundred years ago lotteries were used by the churches to raise money for different purposes in fact morality is largely relative in england the king all the royal family lords and commons nobility gentry and middle classes everybody in every official rank and condition in society pays his or her way on the railroads such a thing as a free pass is unknown a judge in england who would accept a free pass from a railroad and then try a case in which that railroad was interested would be driven in disgrace from the bench there is no such acute sense of judicial propriety here and among us in washington last winter it was jokingly told that when one of our united states supreme judges was tendered an annual pass by one of the railroads he became very much offended and said indignantly that he would not receive it in the form it was issued to him the railroad official who had brought the pass anxious to please him asked him in what form he would take it the learned judge replied that it ought to he amended and that they should insert in it that the pass was for him and his family do that and i will accept it it was done hon b q evans in a newspaper article last december among other things on this subject said i with the fight that has been going on in this state between the people and the railway companies over the proposition that a law should be passed prohibiting railway companies from giving passes to public officials and with the victories won by the railway companies by the means of the free pass and the lobby over the people each victory only emphasizes the necessity for the law and with this contest going on it is no more an open question in texas as to what the purpose is that a railway company has in giving a pass to public officials it used to be thought that it was given as a mere matter of courtesy to the officials and all men tried to reason with themselves that this was the purpose and have justified themselves in accepting them but the only purpose that a railway company has in giving a pass toan official is for the purpose of influencing his official conduct will any man deny this"], [0.0976669192314148, 0.9023330807685852, 1, "the status of railroad property in this country is in some respects unique it has never in my judgment been more correctly and lucidly defined than it was by the supreme court of the united states in the case of smyth v ames from the state of nebraska in that case the court said a railroad is a public highway and none the less so because constructed and maintained through the agency of a corporation deriving its existence and powers from the state such a corporation was created for public purposes it performsa function of the state its authority to exercise the right of eminent domain and to charge tolls was given primarily for the benefit of the public it can not therefore be admitted that a railroad corporation maintaining a highway under the authority of the state may fix its rates with a view solely to its own interests and ignore the rights of the public again the court says in that case a corporation maintaining a public highway although it owns the property it employs for accomplishing public objects must be held to have accepted its rights privileges and franchises subject to the condition that the government creating it or the government within whose limits it conducts its business may by legislation protect the people against unreasonable charges for tile services rendered by it it can not be assumed that any railroad corporation accepting franchises rights and privileges at the hands of the public ever supposed that it acquired or that it was intended to grant to it the power to construct and maintain a public highway simply for its benefit without regard to the rights of the public what the company is entitled to asksays the court 0 is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience on the other hand what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth the doctrine recognized by the court in that case has been so long so clearly and so firmly established in our political economy and jurisprudence that it is inconceivable to me that anyone can be found possessing sufficient audacity to call it in question but how often do we hear it flippantly proclaimed that the railroad business is private business with which the government has no right to interfere that any attempt to regulate that business is socialistic and only a step toward the regulation of all other private business of the country this has been the ceaseless cry of the propaganda whlich has been so extravagantly carried on by the railroad interests in this country ever since the question of their further regulation began to be agitated in congress those of us who stand for justice to the people through effective regulation of railways might well ignore this fallacious argument engendered by selfinterest we all know that error and sophistry are quite good enough for the monopolist who would through selfinterest continue to plunder the people rd force unjust tribute from them but extraordinary as it may seem we have heard proclaimed on the floor of this house these same fallacies and sophistries and have heard the doctrine of the true status of railroad property denied by gentlemen of ability and learning who ought to know better prior to the construction of steam railroads the public highways were owned by the sovereign and were kept open to the public at all times upon equal terms those engaged as common carriers upon the public highways were subject to regulation by law their freedom of contract was limited they were denied the right to make any contract unreasonably limiting their liability as insurers of the safety of the goods carried and they were not permitted to charge more than a reasonable compensation for the service performed under the common law an overcharge could be recovered back at the suit of the shipper the strong arm of the government was ever ready to protect the shipper from both discrimination and extortion these principles and policies have come down to us as a part of the common law and we have in many forms recognized them and crystallized them into both organic and statutory law the transportation business like many other elements of commerce has undergone radical changes upon the invention of the steam railway the state began the creation of railroad corporations endowed them with the power of eminent domain and other attributes of sovereignty surrendered to them the exclusive use of the public highways and gave them a monopoly of the transportation business with this great evolution came the necessity for greater and more effective regulation by the state the whole transportation business passed into the hands of private monopoly as was so aptly said by the supreme court of the united states while shippers of merchandise are under no legal necessity to use the railroads they are so practically the demand for speedy and prompt movement virtually forbids the employment of slow and oldfashioned methods of transportation at least in the ease of more valuable articles of traffic at the same time the immense outlay of money required to build and maintain railroads and the necessity for resorting in securing the rights of way to the power of eminent domain in effect disable individual merchants and shippers from themselves providing such means of carriage from the very nature of the case therefore railroads are monopolies and the evils that usually accompany monopolies soon began to show themselves and were the cause of loud complaint these remarks of the supreme court would be true in a large measure if every railroad in the country was operated independently of every other railroad but it is especially true now when all the railroads which permeate every part of the country are combined into a few groups and are to a large extent under a common management so while good and sufficient reasons existed at common law for government supervision of the rates of common carriers an additional very potent reason now exists why the modern carrier shall be subject to rigid regulation by the government and that is it is a monopoly holding within its grasp the whole transportation business of this country an element that enters into our whole commercial and industrial life and unless this monopoly is restrained or regulated it has the power to charge what it chooses and thus levy whatever tax it pleases upon every form of property i have no doubt of the constitutionality the morality or the wisdom of the legislation now under consideration in this house the states sovereign in their character possessing the inherent right to regulate the common carriers doing business within their own limits delegated to the national government so much of this right as might be required for the regulation of interstate commerce it is this power that congress is being called upon to exercise i have no doubt congress can adopt whatever means may be necessary in its judgment to carry this power into effect no character of regulation of railroads in my judgment is worthy of the name of regulation which does not protect the public from discrimination and extortion in rates the fixing of any portion of the rates of a railroad necessarily involves it seems to me a comprehensive review if not a supervision of all its rates and therefore when we consider the vast number of railroads engaged in interstate transportation the great multitude and variety of the rates of each and the rapidly changing conditions which ought to be considered in the fixing and regulation of rates it must be admitted by all that it is absolutely beyond the power of congress to effectively regulate rates except through the instrumentality of an administrative board the creation of a commission with the power to fix rotes in my judgment is justified by the very necessities of the ease in no other way can congress exercise efficaciously the power to regulate interstate commerce this is wellsettled doctrine both congress and the supreme court have recognized it some years ago congress passed an act excluding the importation of tea below standards to be fixed by a board to be selected by the se ctary of the treasury this act for the regulation of com2263 merce with foreign nations you will observe not only left the determination of the quality of the teas to be excluded or admitted to customadministrative officers but also delegated the fixing of the standards to an administrative board the constitutionality of this act was called in question in the case of butterfield v stanahan 192 u s 471 and the court held that the act was not unconstitutional because it delegated authority which belonged exclusively to congress in that case the court said congress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable and from the necessities of the case was compelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing about the result pointed out by the statute to deny the power of congress to delegate such a duty would in effect nount but to declaring that the plenary power vested in congress to regulate foreign commerce could not be efficaciously exerted in the bill under consideration it is not proposed to go so far as congress went in that tea act toward delegating legislative authority to administrative officers we here propose for congress itself to fix the standardto say that a rate or practice of the railroad should be just and reasonableand we leave to th commission only the duty of seeing that the rate or practice conforms to the standard thus laid down i want to say that in my humble judgment to deny that congress can confer such power upon a commission is to ignore the decision of the supreme court to which i have referred and to declare that the plenary power vested in congress to regulate commerce between the states can not be efficaciously exerted as i have already said i have no doubt as to the morality of this measure we are not as has so often been intimated attempting to confiscate the property of those whose money is invested in railroads we are only acting in selfdefense we are not only willing but anxious to accord to them every farthing to which under the law and the constitution they are entitled but we think the time has come when we should safeguard our own interests and let them know that they can no longer confiscate our property common carriers have never been entitled to charge a higher rate than was just and reasonable and whoever has invested his money in railroad property has done so with full knowledge of this principle and therefore can not now complain if he be required to conform to it he can not be injured it is beyond the power of congress to deprive him of just compensation any attempt to do so would contravene a plain guaranty of the constitution and be null and void for the power to regulate is not the power to destroy another thing in this connection i desire to call attention to and that is that we are not only not attempting to deprive the railroad people of their substantive rights but we have no desire to deprive them of any of their remedies indeed such a thing would also be beyond our power the courts of this country are always open alike to every citizen and he can go there and have his rights whatever they may be adjudicated and enforced all the hue and cry which we have heard about the right of appeal from the orders of the commission and of having rates fixed by the courts have not been for the purpose of preserving the legitimate rights of the railroads but of defeating effective and proper regulation the railroads know as well as we do that the power to fix rates can not be conferred upon the courts either in an original suit or on an appeal even if an appeal to the courts could be provided from an administrative order which is impossible i have no doubt that a commission would be hetter qualified for the business of regulating rates fairly and justly between the railroads and the people than the courts could possibly be and i believe it is not only right and proper but absolutely essential to any sort of effective rate regulation that the findings of the commission on questions of fact be given not only prima facie but conclusive effect that whenever it fixes a rate as just and reasonable such rate shall be accepted as such by all the world unless it can be shown in a judicial proceeding to be so low as to amount to confiscation the giving of such effect to acts of an administrative officer is no new doctrine it has been frequently recognized by the supreme court of the united states i have said this much upon the general subject of the power of congress to regulate railroad rates by means of a commission in order to give expression to my belief that this measure is undoubtedly constitutional and valid i have no doubt it will be upheld by the courts in its present form and would be if amended so as to give more radical substantial and effective relief to the people the bill is good as far as it goes if passed in its present form it would be a great improvement upon existing law under which the unbridled railroads plunder the people and demoralize the commercial and industrial interests of the country but sir i think it is no disrespect to the committee which brought this bill in to say that it might be improved i believe it could be vastly improved by the adoption of the amendment which i have had read from the clerks desk under the bill in its present form the commission will be permitted to act only upon complaint and as i understand it can revise only the rate or rates specified in the complaint i can not understand how the question can be determined as to whether or not a given rate or even a group of rates of a railroad are either just reasonable nondiscriminatory or fairly remunerative without a comprehensive review and investigation of all the rates of that railroad in connection with all the other facts which should be taken into consideration as a basis for fixing rates upon such a review and investigation i can very well see how the commission may and probably will in almost every instance find the adjustment or revision of some kindred rate or rates other than those embraced in the complaint necessary to the full and complete relief of the public why should not the commission be given power to act upon its own motion in such instances after notice to the railroad and after full hearing why should not the public be allowed the full benefit of the knowledge acquired by the commission in its investigations i do not believe any good reason can be given in answer to these questions as a general rule the consumers of this country pay the freight the producer or middleman may pay the transportation charges in the first instance but in the end the burden falls upon the shoulders of the consumer they may be paid to the railroad by the producer or the jobber in a lump sum but it is paid back to the jobber little by little in the increased cost of the goods they purchase from him the jobber rarely ever complains of excessive freight charges he merely shifts the burden to his customers by adding the freight to the price at which he sells his goods he will never go to the commission with a complaint except when the railroad by discrimination gives to his competitor some advantage over him but never merely to correct an excessive rate likewise the producer takes no notice of excessive freight charges when the burden of paying them can be shifted to the consumer when the circumstances are such that the producer himself must bear the losses incident to excessive charges lie will complain to the commission but not otherwise so i believe i am safe in saying that much the larger part of the stupendous sum of money paid to the railroads annually in this country as freight charges is paid by the consumers and therefore the greater part of the injustice resulting from excessive rates has fallen upon their shoulders they have not paid it to the railroads direct they have not it may be dealt with the railroads at all they are the millions of plain people in this country who create its wealth who eat bread by the sweat of their brows who fill the workshops and who till the soil and dig the mines they pay the freight when they buy food and clothing for their families or material to build improve and furnish their homes they pay it unconsciously they have had no opportunity to study or investigate freight problems and are without means of informing themselves upon the question as to whether they have been imposed upon tlw se are the people in whose behalf i have offered my amendment the bill makes ample protection for the producers of the country it will afford ample relief for the jobber or middleman but it still leaves the consumer without remedy having had no direct transaction with the railroad he can make no complaint to the commission and no one will make such complaint for him lets give the commission power to take care of him by authorizing that body to act upon its own motion this we can do by adopting the amendment which i have offered but it may be vain for me to indulge the hope or expectation that the powers of the commission will be further enlarged at this time by this house by the adoption of any amendment it is an open secret here that the democratic members of the committee had to make many concessions and had to even go so far as to pledge themselves to resist all amendments that might be offered in order to secure the favorable report and passage of the bill giving the inadequate relief that it does for ten years the democratic party always the stanch champion of the people has demanded the enlargement of the powers of the commission and such control of railroads as would protect the people from robbery and oppression for ten years the people have petitioned for relief during all this time the republican party has been in absolute control of every department of the government and has had the power to enact any sort of legislation for their relief but up to this time the demands of the people have been wholly disregarded by that party while the oppressions they have suffered have continued so i suppose under the circumstances the people should be congratulated that you gentlemen on the other side of this chamber have been induced to yield as far as you have the big stick may have influenced you some but to the insistent determined demands of an outraged people who could no longer be turned aside is due whatever measure of relief this bill affords you will yet yield further the masses of this country have awakened to the situation and are demanding their rights you can no longer continue your policy of fostering private monopoly to plunder the people and remain in power i warn you now that you must continue the work of reform in which you have been forced to make a small beginning or give place to others who will be sent here to continue it i speak now not only of reform in legislation with reference to the control of the railroad monopoly but also of reform in the policy you are maintaining with reference to the great private monopolies of the country for forty years your legislation has been in the interest of special classes by a protective tariff in the interest of the manufacturer which has been so high as to outrage every just principle of international trade you have protected him from all competition from abroad while you have permitted him to stifle all competition at home by means of combinations and agreements in restraint of trade in violation of l v under this vicious policy under which you have up to this time been standing pat have been built up the most gigantic trusts and combinations the world has ever known they have multiplied in number and grown in power until they hold within their merciless grasp the commercial and industrial welfare of this country they corrupt our elections debauch our officials plunder both the producers and consumers of the country and defy the government itself the people of this country feel that they have endured quite long enough the oppressions visited upon them by this infamous policy they are now asking a changea square deal wanting no special favors from the government themselves they demand that none shall be given to others equal rights to all and special privileges to none the very corner stone of our governmenthas ever been their motto they feel that this government is of the people by the people and for the people they are terribly in earnest so let those in power beware who would turn a deaf ear to them as certain as god reigns they are going to have

repeatedly asserting that this is a democratic measure and that the principles of the bill had their birth in democratic councils they even charge that the republican party is driven to take up the legislation by an irresistible public demand everyone will concede that the democratic party has met in conventions and adopted platforms which at the time may have been in favor with the people and which it conceived would add to the popularity of the party it is characteristic of the party to adopt highsounding platforms rather than to formulate policies which may with safety be enacted into

republican party without platform declarations rather than the democratic party with them if something effective is to be done the people naturally turn to the republican party for its accomplishment as they have in order to secure legislation on this question the record of the republican party is secure in the fact that all the important laws on the federal statute books were placed there by it if our democratic friends desire to know the record of their party in the enactment of legislation against trusts and illegal combinations it will only be necessary to go back into history to the time when both the president and the house of representatives were democratic in his annual message to congress in december 1887 the president called the attention of congress to the fact that trusts were then in existence and that others were constantly forming and were becoming a menace to the welfare of the country the house authorized one of its important committees to investigate the question of whether or not trusts were then in existence and others in process of formation an investigation was instituted which continued over a period of several months when the committee reported to the house that it had found trusts to be in existence and that others were being organized after this report was made the committee continued to further investigate the question but refrained from making its final report until two days prior to the expiration of the democratic administration and the inauguration of a republican president when it came into the house and reported that it was unable to deal with the question and that on account of the difficulty of the members of the committee to agree upon a plan of action the whole matter was referred to the next congress for its consideration the next congress as well as the president was republican and within a short time after it convened a law was passed against trusts and illegal combinations which is known as the sherman antitrust law this law was passed by a republican congress and signed by a republican president since its enactment trusts and illegal combinations of capital have been and are being successfully prosecuted i say this not alone with a view to eulogizing the republican party but to show our democratic friends the distinction between adopting platforms and enacting wholesome legislation i am in favor of this measure and shall vote for it but shall not do so in order to get rid of it and to hurry it to another forum in the hope that there it may undergo a destructive surgical operation i trust that when it is returned to this body it will not be in such a distorted condition that its identity can not be recognized i do not contend that the measure is perfect for as i view it it is not but the principle of the bill meets with my hearty approval and in addition it contains features which are highly desirable the legislation which is sought to be secured is of the highest importance and worthy of most serious consideration it may be regarded as progressive legislation it goes one step further than has yet been taken by the general government in the direction of remedial legislation intended to regulate common carriers engaged in interstate commerce it is not new in its provision for the creation of a commission to investigate the reasonableness of rates of common carriers for the law now in force provides for such a commission but it is new in that it confers upon the commission greater powers than it has heretofore possessed it has been frequently asserted during the debate and not seriously disputed that for several years after the cullom law of 1887 was enacted it was generally understood by the people that the commission was clothed with authority to substitute a rate where upon complaint by the shipper the one then in force was found to be unjust unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory and the rate which the commission should thus prescribe should become the legal rate to be charged by the carrier unless and until set aside by a proper tribunal in 1897 the supreme court of the united states in what is known as the maximum rate case reported in 167 united states supreme court reports held that the cullom law did not confer upon the commission the power to substitute a rate in place of the one condemned and that the order of the comnxission in prescribing a rate for the future amounted to nothing more than a recommendation to the common carrier it is needless tp say that since that time the orders of the commission have neither been respected nor obeyed this want of power on the part of the commission to fix a rate in the place of one condemned is recognized as the weak spot in the interstatecommerce law personally i have believed and now believe that an amendiiient of a few words to the law of 1887 expressly restoring to the commission what has been termed this lost power would go far toward correcting the evils complained of one of the features of this measure and in my judgment the main one is intended to strengthen the law by giving to the commission the power which the people of the country generally believe was conferred upon it until this decision of the supreme court of the united states was made it was because of the attempt to remedy this defect in the cullom law and to confer upon the commission this power that the intense opposition on the part of the railroad companies which for several months the country has witnessed was organized and which has been instant in season and out of season endeavoring to defeat the legislation here is the battle ground between the people on the one side and the corporations on the other the issue is clearly defined and is well understood the purpose is not to deprive the carriers of the right to fix rates in the first instance nor is it to gie the commission power to initiate rates the question is shall the government be authorized by a law of congress to regulate the great transportation companies in the united states to the extent that the commission where upon complaint and investigation a rate fixed by the carrier is found to be unjust unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory shall have the right to prescribe what it determines to be a just reasonable and fairly remunerative rate and to put it in force in the future in the place of the one condemned if the bill in question is enacted into law then this power will be given to the commission if it fails to become a law then the effort to secure rate legislation will have been waged in vain and the evils which now exist will continue if this bill becomes a law it will be a triumph for the people and will vitalize the provision of the constitution conferring upon congress the right to regulate commerce among the states by placing in the hands of the government a power to say that the rate to be charged by the common carrier for the transportation of persons and property shall be just and reasonable and to confer upon a commission of its own creation the power to condemn as unjust and unreasonable a rate fixed by the carrier and to substitute in lieu thereof a rate for the future which the commission determines to be just reasonable and fairly remunerative what are the objections urged against this legislation it is contended by some gentlemen that congress has not the power to prescribe a rate to govern the carrier in the future it is asserted by a larger number that if this power is conceded congress has not the authority to create a commission and clothe it with power to prescribe a rate to govern the carrier in any sense speaking for myself i am fully convinced that as a matter of law congress itself can prescribe a maximum rate of charge for the carrier and i am just as fully convinced that it may commit to a commission of its own creation the power to prescribe a rate iil the manner provided for in this measure the supreme court of the united states in the case of munn v illinois held that under the powers inherent in every sovereignty a government may regulate the conduct of its citizens toward each other and when necessary for the public good the manner in which each shall use his own property this language states a proposition which has been good law as long as common carriers have had an existence and is good law at this time the owner of private property used in a strictly private way and so as not to interfere with the rights of others can use it free from legislative regulation or control but when it becomes affected with a public interest and is devoted to a use in which the public has an interest the public acquires an interest in such use and the owner can be compelled to submit to regulation by the public to the extent of such interest this is not a new doctrine in the exercise of this power it has been the custom in england for centuries and in this country from the earliest times to regulate ferries hackmen warehousemen millers and the like and to fix a maximum charge to be made for services rendered or accommodations furnished it is held by the supreme court of the united states that the legislature has the same control over business and property of corporations that it has over that of individuals a large number of states in the union have enacted laws creating commissions for the purpose of fixing rates and freights to be charged by common carriers within the state and in some states the commission is given the power to initiate rates the right of states to enact such legislation has been most vigorously assailed in the courts but in all the cases which have been submitted to the supreme court of the united states the power of the state to enact the legislation has been fully sustained and today no respectable lawyer is willing to question this power on the part of the state no reason can be urged for claiming that if a state can legally enact such legislation to regulate its domestic commerce that congress can not do the same thing respecting commerce of an interstate character in the maximum rate case heretofore referred to the court in considering the question as to the extent of the power conferred upon the interstate commerce commission under the cullom law and whether the act conferred upon it the power to prescribe a rate for the future in lieu of the one which it condemned uses this language there are three obvious but dissimilar courses open for consideration congress might itself prescribe a rate or it might commit to some subordinate tribunal this duty or it might leave with the companies the right of fixing rates subject to such regulations and restrictions as well as to that rule which is as old as the existence of common carriers to wit that rates must be reasonable this language is susceptible of but one construction and that is that congress has the power to say that the rates to be charged by a common carrier shall be just and reasonable and to create a commission and to clothe it with power not only to investigate a rate complained of but if found to be unjust unreasonable or unjustly digcriminatory to prescribe a rate to take its place in the future and that the rate thus prescribed shall become the legal rate unless and until set aside by a proper tribunal the pending measure is limited rather than general in its scope it is reasonable rather than radical it does not purport to remedy all existing evils a bill framed to correct all abuses in interstate commerce would stand but little show of becoming a law there may be disappointment beciuse the bill does not include express compinies pullman companies and some other public agencies which it is desirable to regulate but it must be borne in mind that to secure any relief the bill must first pass both houses of congress and the danger is that if it embraces too many features however meritorious it will encounter such opposition that its defeat will be encompasged for this reason it is better to omit some of the features which invite opposition than to entirely defeat the legislation this measure seems to have been framed with the chief purpose of conferring upon the interstate commerce commission the power which the supreme court in the maximum rate case held was not given to it by the cullom law that is the power to prescribe a rate for the future in a case where upon investigation the rate in force is condemned as unjust unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory this power is clearly given in the pending measure and is its crowning feature and if nothing else were included the law when enacted will be worthy of all the efforts which have been made to secure its adoption but there are other provisions in the bill which if not so important as this one in solving the problem of rate control will prove of great aid in restraining an evil which has obtained and still continues in spite of the elkins law against rebates and which results in discriminations in favor of the large shipper as against the small one i refer to the mischief which comes from the use of the private car private car lines switches terminal facilities and charges for services rendered by the shipper as a means of securing and enabling the payment of rebates it is a matter of common knowledge that frequently the shipper by reason of owning a spur or track connecting his plant with the main line of railroad or by owning the cars in which his products are carried to market or because of services rendered by him is enabled to make claims for exorbitant offsets in settlement of transportation charges which the carrier willingly sometimes unwillingly allows and the shipper thus favored is able to have his produce carried at a much lower rate than his competitor who must take his choice of retiring from business or facing bankruptcy this bill furnishes a remedy against the further practice of this abuse and in my opinion a remedy which will effectually prevent a continuance of this evil for which there is no defense in law or morals the publicity feature of the bill is desirable and should not only aid in discouraging rebates but in preventing other abuses which have obtained in the past the proposed legislation is not sought in a spirit of hostility but in a desire to recognize and secure the rights of both the transportation companies and the people no one could justify a motive less exalted the interests involved are too great and the consequences of what may be done will be too farreaching to excuse anything short of the exercise of the highest intelligence and the loftiest purposes in dealing with the matter on the one hand are the common carriers with billions upon billions invested in their properties with over 200 000 miles of railroad earning more than 2 000 000 000 annually paying expenses amounting to nearly 1 500 000 000 employing more than a million and a quarter of men and whose wages aggregate almost a billion of dollars each year these vast interests are warning us against the dangers of interfering with existing conditions on the other hand are more than 80 000 000 people with an aggregate wealth of a hundred billion dollars greater than that of any other nation and practically equal to that of any other two nations who of necessity must avail themselves of the use of the railroads in transporting passengers and freights and in moving the immense commerce of the country who demand not as a favor but as a right that these great agencies of commerce shall not be permitted to continue the abuses which all admit have existed in thel ast and that the congress of the united states shall accept the responsibility which under the constitution devolves upon it and enact such legislation as will cure existing evils and promote the interests of both the carrier and the shipper alike with a full realization of the importance of the obligation which rests upon us we can not fail to strive to deal fairly with all interests and thereby carry out the suggestion of president roosevelt that the highways of commerce must be kept open to all on equal terms this is our highest duty and should be our highest pleasure"], [0.8768182396888733, 0.8768182396888733, 0, "that is a case for applying the doctrine of de minimus he might have added to it leather he himself

testify and i hope he will make as good a governor of massachusetts as he made an inspectorgeneral of camps in florida georgia and cuba but he will have to be revised a little on the tariff question

worked up to a little pitch by somebody interrupting as they are in the habit sometimes of doing here when a gentleman is making a speech something was said about the laborers and he tiptoed beautifully and said i think tile american farm laborers and mechanics are abundantly able to take care of themselves why not i agree to that proposition but i do not agree with it at all if you are going to have a power somewhere in the country to decree that the laborer of this country shall not take care of himself here but shall be put in competition with the pauper labor of other countries of the world if you let them alone they can take care of themselves but if you insist on that propositionthat comes from some great sympathizing philanthropist somebody who had gotten higher than belongs to common humanity who had passed into a stage of christian civilization never reached beforethat is a different thing there are some free traders who insist upon the claim that the way to get prosperity in this country to get people in foreign lands to buy of us is to quit producing at home and turn our laborers out and go there and buy of them that is a central idea of democratic free trade they say how can you expect european countriesgermany france england russia and italyto come and buy goods of you here in your country unless you go over there first and buy of them let us look at that question backward was anybody ever such a fool in england france germany or any other country in the world as to say the right way to get these rich americans over in the united states to come

people of porto rico to teach them the lesson of industry we must furnish opportunity the free interchange of commodities among all the people under the american flag is one of the fundamental principles of our government it is as much our plain duty to grant free trade to the people of the philippines as it ever was to the people of porto rico there is no excuse to continue our tariff against them except for the purpose of revenue the members of the minority of the committee offer a substitute but say in this report that if such substitute is voted down they will support the bill of the majority so it is safe to assune that tariff legislation in the interest of the filipinos will be enacted during the present session of congress while there is perhaps an increasing number of our citizens who wish that dewey had sailed away from the islands after the battle of manila bay it is very generally recognized i think that we shall retain them for at least a generationit may be manyuntil the people are prepared for selfgovernment in the meantime it is but common justice that we should give them every reasonable opportunity for development and prosperity now that the committee on ways and means has heard and favorably considered the prayer of the wards of the nation i trust it will not he considered treasonable for a republican to suggest to that committee that it give some consideration to the appeal of the citizens here at home for relief from oppressive tariff schedules for some time they have been asking for free hides and free coal and free iron ore and free lumber they have begged for free alcohol in the arts and for a reduction of some of the duties fixed in 1897 and now believed to be too high they would like to have the committee on ways and means make a thorough investigation to determine if changes in existing tariff rates are not now demanded by changed conditions the republican party has said that the tariff would be revised by its friends when demanded by changed conditions i believe that tariff revision and readjustment should be undertaken now and that is the expressed opinion of the republicans of my state at the republican state convention held in boston on october 6 1905 the committee on resolutions submitted a platform which included a resolution favoring an immediate consideration of the tariff for the purpose of revision and readjustment that tariff plank occasioned spirited discussion in the convention and has been the subject of varied comment ever since it goes without saying that in a matter of this kind it is impossible to satisfy everyone the committee on resolutions of tile massachusetts republican state convention clearly realizing that fact did not attempt a feat so unwise imprudent and impossible this much however was accomplished the platform was satisfactory to all but one of the nineteen members of the committee on resolutions and it was adopted by the convention by a vote which was alaost unanimous although there was some opposition to the resolution no one ventured to test the sentiment of the convention by offering an amendmenta fact which speaks volumes it was clear that the views of an overwhelming majority of the republicans of massachusetts had been satisfactorily expressed i feel that i have a right therefore to ask my party associates in congress to give to that deliberate and carefully considered expression of opinion their honest and favorable attention the resolution to which i ask your consideration reads as follows we believe that the policy of protection to american labor and american industry should be maintained the republican party of massachusetts reaffirms its devotion to the principle of protection and is opposed to tariff changes tending to depress or destroy any of our industrics or to lower the wages of american labor but we recognize the fact as declared by the national republican convention at chicago that rates shonld be changed when conditions have so changed that the public interest demands the alteration of schedules the time at which revision of the tariff should be undertaken must be determined by the representatives of the party from all parts of our common country we approve the position takeh by our senators and representatives at the last session of congress in favor of present action and we urge that they should continue to press upon their party associates in congress from other states the wisdom of a consideration of the tariff for the purpose of revision and readjustment by this resolution massachusetts republicans reaffirmed their devotion to the principle of protection and expressed their opposition to tariff changes tending to depress or destroy any of our industries or to lower the wages of american labor surely any who desire changes which would wreck our industries or lower wages have no standing in a republican convention or in the republican party republicans are protectionists no matter how much they may differ as to the necessity for changes in tariff schedules they all believe that the policy of protection should be maintained the history of our country justifies our adherence to that policy the story of our wonderful progress under republican administration is a familiar one you know of the great increase in our national wealth you do not need to be reminded of the amazing growth of our exports last year our exports were 1 491 744 695 the largest in our history we have become the greatest manufacturing nation in the world and last year our exports of manufactured goods were nearly 100 000 000 more than in the previous year more than 5 000 000 people are engaged in this branch of industry the lamented secretary hay told us a year ago that the value of manufactured goods was thirteen times as much as it was when the republicans met at jackson in 1854 republican conventions everywhere call attention as well they may to the magnificent results of protection from the beginning of the government to the present time and contrast them with the disaster which has resulted from the opposite policy whenever it has been put in practice the democratic party at its national convention in 1904 declared that it favored a gradual reduction of the tariff but influential members of that party members of the house committee on ways and means who would be very active and influential in framing a new tariff bill in the event of democratic success have said on the floor of the house that protection was robbery and that if they could have their way they would tear down every customhouse from turret to foundation stone and that we must never lose sight of the ultimate goalfree trade it is not strange that the american people at the last presidential election declined in no uncertain way to follow leadership whicll would change the policy under which we have grown so strong and the republicans of massachusetts very naturally reaffirmed their devotion to the principle of protection but they also recognized the fact as declared by the national republican convention at chicago that rates should be changed when conditions have so changed that the public interest demands the alteration of schedules they also recognized the fact that the time at which revision of the tariff should be undertaken nmust be determined by the representatives of the party from all parts of our common country the republicans of massachusetts do not ask their representatives to atteampt to bring about tariff revision by making an alliance with representatives of the democratic party who do not agree with them as to the nece ssity of maintaining the protective principle they wish tariff revision but they recognize that it should come by the action of the representatives of their own party from all parts of our country having recognized the facts that changes should be made in tariff schedules when the public interest demands them and that the time for such changes must be determined by the representatives of their own party the delegates at our convention approved the position taken by their senators and representalives in favor of present action and urged that they should continue to press upon their party associates in congress from other states the wisdom of a consideration of the tariff for the purpose of revision and readjustment i know that this declaration has been denounced by democrats and by certain high priests of the standpatters who are perhaps moved by fear that some pet schedu a may be jarred by revision as a straddle but i respectfully submit that those who so characterize it must be perverse to the verge of hopelessness it is still true that there are none so blind as those who wont see or who do not want to see present action does not mean past action or future action it means nowthat now is the accepted time the republicans of massachusetts have thus in most positive terms placed themselves on record as favoring aln immediate revision and adjustment of tariff schedules the republican party is not never has been and i trust never will become a standpat party its motto is not and never has been let well enough alone it could not have accomplished its great work for our country and for humanity if it had been animated by any such milkandwater sentiment as that it does not stand pat it is not content with the work it has already accomplished but faces the future new problems are now pressing for solutionproblems which must be solved aright if the welfare of our country is to be secureand the republican party should be ready and eager to attest to the work now awaiting it henry l dawes who represented massachusetts in the house and the senate for thirtysix consecutive years and whose splendid devotion to the cause of protection can never be forgotten has said it is a mistake to suppose that tariff legislation is a fixed science there can be no tariff formulated that can last while all conditions on which it is based are changing i hold it to be the duty of a party responsible for a tariff law to see to it that when a duty is no longer heeded for the protection of our industries it be removed when it has become so high as to be a bounty and thus an unnecessary tax upon the consumer it be reduced protection is based upon the difference in the cost of production abroad and at home no one should ask for more the dingley law was enacted more than eight years ago i have never heard anyone claim that it was perfect even at the time of its enactment concessions had to be made it was necessarily a compromise in many particulars it was not when finally enacted as mr dingley desired it to be it was the best that could be done under all the circumstances and has proved a wonderfully efficient law it would however be amazing indeed if during the past eight years there had not been changes in conditions which call for some modification of our tariff schedules by way of revision and adjustment it is not like the republican party to shrink from an honest and thorougih consideration of a subject because such consideration may be surrounded by difficulties it is responsible for the the dingley law and is therefore responsible for any injustice which exists by reason of it there should be no desire to escape from that conclusion we have a large majority in the senate and house of representatives having the power we should not hestitate to use it let us give to this subject honest and fearless consideration when such consideration discloses the fact that a duty is no longer needed let us remove it this is simple justice it will benefit all the people and will i believe be responsive to the commercial needs of the country it was suggested at our state convention that a specific demand be made that hides coal iron ore lumber and wood pulp be placed on the free list personally it seemed to me tihen and it seems to me now that there are sound reasons for urging that these articles be placed on the free list that is certainly so with respect to hides coal and iron ore in november a delegation of boot and shoe and leather manufacturers called on president roosevelt and urged upon him the necessity of a repeal of the duty on hides the delegation numbered twentyeight men representing a majority of the leather tanning and boot and shoe industries of the united states and a majority of them came from new york and the west they claimed to speak for the manufacturers of 300 000 000 worth of shoes that they employed over 100 000 workmen and pay about 75 000 000 to wageearners they said that they were unanimous in asking for the repeal of the duty on hides that this great industry is oppressed and burdened by a needless duty which prevents proper growth and expansion both domestic and foreign attention was called to the fact that the cost of leather in the cheap heavy shoes worn by the greatest number of our people is proportionately greater than in expensive and highly finished shoes and so the spokesman for the delegation claimed that they were pleading not alone for those engaged in manufacturing but also for the welfare of the people who wear shoes about 240 000 000 pairs of shoes are made annually in the united states and the difference in the price of leather here and where there is no duty on hides varies from 3 to 5 cents per pound which means from 4 to 7 cents on the average factory cost the price of hides has risen from 9 cents in 1897 to 15 cents in 1905 as cattle are raised and slaughtered principally for beef hides are a byproduct and it is doubtful if cattle raisers gain any benefit from the duty as prices fluctuate so far as the trust permits in accord with the supply and demand for cattle for beef purposes it has been often insinuated that the manufacturers who were crying so loudly for the removal of the duty on hides were actuated solely by selfish purposes that while they wished no duty on hides they would fight vigorously against any reduction of the duty on their manufactured product the gentlemen who appeared before the president denied this and stated that they would willingly consent to a reasonable reduction of this duty exgovernor douglas a democrat and one of the largest manufacturers of shoes in the world closed his remarks by saying tlhe duty on hides permits a charge of 15 per cent more for hides here than in foreign markets in the boot and shoe industry we pay the highest wages on earth but we have the cheapest labor where efficiency and product are considered neither we manufacturers nor our employees are protected to any considerable extent by the duty of 25 per cent on boots and shoes all we ask is a fair field and no favor either in our own or in foreign markets take away the duties that prevent us from obtaining leather at the same prices paid by our foreign competitors and we will not only hold our own markets with or without a duty on shoes but we will invade foreign markets on an extensive scale in so doing we will provide additional work at good wages to our boot and shoe workers while the duty on hides bears heavily on our industry in every part of the country now that germany canada and mexico are discriminating against our shoes and are levying or threatening to levy much higher duties upon them it will be even more difficult for us to hold our share of this industry handicapped as we are unless the cost of materials can be reduced shoes must soon sell at higher prices hon curtis guild jr a republican who has just been elected governor of massachusetts supplemented the efforts of the delegation of manufacturers by a letter to the president in which he said here in massachusetts the duty on hides is anathema it is known that only 23 per cent of the hides and skins that come into the united states are subject to duty and it seems perfectly illogical that calfskins sheepskins and goatskins should come in free as a byl roduct while a duty is assessed on the skins of fullgrown cati le there can be no question of the desire of the overwhelming majority of the people of this state for attention to such matters as this in the immediate revision of the tariff i know it is feared by some probably many that any serious consideration of tariff changes will bring demoralization to business many socalled standpatters freely admit that there are glaring errors in our present tariff law which demand attention they say that they would favor correcting such errors if it could be done without a general tariff revision but they argue that the country is now prosperous and that nothing ought to be done which might disturb present business conditions i can not share that fear if action is taken by the friends of protection by those absolutely pledged to maintain the principle of protection if such changes made to right admitted wrongs can not be brought about without placing in peril our prosperity then it seems to me such prosperity must be conceded to rest upon very unstable foundation and to be a growth of the mushroom variety history has a habit of repeating itself and there is certainly reason to fear that if changes demanded in the interest of the people are not made the task of revision will be handed over to those who are opposed to the principle of protection and bent upon its destruction we had that kind of revision not many years ago and the humiliation and suffering which followed have not been forgotten in four years the value of massachusetts manufactures alone declined over 146 000 000 and the bank clearings of boston fell off over four hundred millions in one year tariff revision by the democratic party meant mills running on short time or not at all and reduced wages remarkable business activity followed the passage of the dingley bill the people do not wish another wilsongorman tariff they have shown again and again by their votes that they distrust the party which was responsible for that bill our orators have proclaimed that the tariff should be revised by its friends we now have a large majority in the house and in the senate having so large a majority i hardly think we should admit our impotence to remedy any injustice for which we are responsible if we deliberately close the door not only to action but to thorough investigation we have none to blame but ourselves for the withdrawal of confidence which will surely follow i can not believe the republican party will shirk what seems so plain a duty and so our republicans of massachusetts have called for inn~ediate action they are protectionists and propose to remain such but they do not believe in the sacredness of any tariff schedule they have urged their representatives to ask the cooperation of their party associates because they know that it is of the utmost importance that such action should be taken not by tariff wreckers by those who would tear down our customhouses but by those who have always been true to the principle of protection the committee on ways and means has heeded the prayer of the filipinos will it not now give some attention to the petitions of our home folks"], [0.8210501670837402, 0.8210501670837402, 0, "i had no intention of saying anything upon this bill because i was confident that my views upon it would be amply and ably expressed by others until last evening when my colleague from massachusetts made some criticisms upon the attitude of the massachusetts republicans i am aware that criticisms upon us have come not only from that side of the house but also from the republican side and while we of course expect and i hope deserve criticism from the democratic side for if we did not i would be very sure we were derelict to our principles yet ido not desire and i do not think we deserve criticism from this side the position the republicans of massachusetts have taken on revision is very simple it is the old republican doctrine that no tariff is sacred that time always makes changes and we thought in the last eight years there have been such extrerdinary inventions so much improvement in methods of production and distribution that it was theoretically fair to presume there must be need of change and when that was brought home to us in particular instances we thought it was good republican doctrine and good common sense that we shoild now have the tariff revised but my colleague yesterday intimated that we held a very difficult position here in trying as he said to steer between the charybdis of home popularity and the scylla of the speakers wishes now for myself with the utmost respect and consideration for the speaker i do nothink i amn excessively anxious to always be in accord with him but i admit that i am always anxious and particularly on a question like this to be in accord with the majority of this side of the house that i trust will always be my position and i do not intend as i never have to be tempted by any democratic alliance to go counter to the views of the majority of the republican party for i am very confident that any such alliance founded as it must be upon entirely different motives and different principles would in the end be unsatisfactory to both parties coesequently my personal intention is to abide by the decision of the majority of the republicans of this house but i do not wish that majority to misunderstand or misinterpret our position i think my colleagues from massachusetts on the democratic side have a much more difficult task than we to keep at once popularity with their constituents and popularity with their colleagues here what is the democratic argument at home it is free raw materials that for years has been the democratic contention is that the position of the democratic party in this house is that the position of their dominant faction why the democrat who spoke last on this subject before my colleague made this remark there is just about as much justice in that proposition as there is in the proposition to tax the people of kentucky to maintain manufacturing institutions in the new england states that is the ordinary democratic doctrine which we hear in this house it is not free raw materialsthat is not democratic doctrinebut it is a reduction of the tariff and yet my democratic colleagues go home to massachusetts and argue to their constituents there for free raw materials and allow it to be understood that the democratic doctrine is to keep up the protection of our industries so that they may flourish as well as ever but to give this additional boon of free raw materials which the republicans are denying to them now you see that is a difficult proposition for us to face because every constituency every state is more or less selfishall are looking for their own advantage and massachusetts just at this time is perhaps in a peculiarly delicate condition because the great industries that have been built up there we see gradually deserting us we see that the west and the south are becoming rivals and year by year we see industry after industry going away and we have got to do something to fill their places massachusetts you know was not originally friendly to protection massachusetts when protection was first suggested fought it vigorously because moved by the same selfish interest which as i say influences all communities they felt that their source of wealth was the sea they felt that with our location and our harbors the sea was our natural source of wealth we had our shipyards and we were beginning to build the clipper ships distancing the world and whitening all the seas with the american commerce and we felt that freer trade meant more trade and a protective tariff would tend to stifle trade and so tend to injure us and therefore massachusetts originally opposed protection but when it was forced upon her with yankee ingenuity she built up her manufacturing industries and her ocean trade languished until now it is her great manufacturing industries that make the wealth of the people therefore she is today for protection and therefore today you will not h e surprised that when she sees rivals growing up all over the united states when she sees that the natural law which brings the manufacturer as near as possible to the raw material is drawing away from her the great wealth that she has acquired and that the capital which has been a great advantage is now being accumulated in the west and south she must strain every nerve to do what she can to maintain her industries therefore when democratic orators go to her and say we will give you free raw materials and then you can compete with the other western and southern states which have the raw materials close by them is it any wonder that such ingenious and disingenuous arguments lead many thoughtless republicans to disregard the fact that these claims will never be substantiated by any democratic legislation in this house and to crave and work for this alluring democratic doctrine do you not see that this theory of free raw materials so attractive to any manufacturing state naturally will have the effect of undermining republican principles and reducing our majority"], [0.8207888603210449, 0.8207888603210449, 0, "i was going on to say that senator gallinger made a thorough examination of this subject and in a speech made on the floor of the senate on the 23d day of april last he placed the value of exports sold at a lower price abroad than at home at 4 000 00o and said i can not find that the substantial corectness of this estimate has ever been questioned by the opposition and i want to say that i have never heard the substantial correctness of this statement questioned except by the gentleman from mississippi who said that he did not believe it therefore the sale of this trifling amount of goodstrifling compared with the vast volume of our manufactured productsenables our manufacturers to run three months in the year oh deliver us from demagogy but let us consider another admission extracted from the gentleman during the debate the gentleman from alabama propounded to the gentleman these questions can the gentleman from pennsylvania name me any steel mill in the world that can make steel rails cheaper than they are made in pittsburg can the gentleman from pennsylvania name me any iron furnace in the world that can make pig iron cheaper than at birmingham the answer of the gentleman was in these words i think not i am coming to that question if the gentleman will have patience in a few moments note the questions and answer if you please can the gentleman name any steel mill in the world can the gentleman name any iron furnace in the world and the gentleman who knows about the prices of iron and steel if anybody does replied in the negative he was compelled to admit that we can manufacture both steel and pig iron here in the united states cheaper than it can be manufactured anywhere else in the world the gentleman said he would come to a discussion of that question in a few moments if the gentleman from alabama would wait but we all waited listening for him to come tot that question we waited for one hour then an hour and a half and then the gentleman was given unlimited time to complete his remarks but he never did come to that question but the people of this country will force his party to come to that very question in the very near future what is the full meaning of that answer we have the admission of the representative of the greatest steelproducing district in the world that the manufacturers of this country can make steel and iron cheaper than any manufacturers on earth and yet they are charging their own people more than they charge any people on earth and gentlemen are so thoroughly partisan they dare to assert that such a practice is right and their party says it is right god help a party with such a conscience if the manufacturers of this country nearly all of whom are formed into trusts can make steel and iron cheaper than any other manufacturers then they can sell it cheaper anywhere and they do not need protection but the trusts protected as they are 9gainst competition from abroad actually have two price listsone foreign the other domesticand the foreign price list is considerably less than the domestic price list the political party which stands for such injustice and discrimination against our own people ought not to be continued in power one hour there is another statement made by the gentleman from pennsylvania to which i will call attention he had not reached the point in his speech where lie waived aside this whole matter by quoting a statement made in the senate by the senator from new hampshire that 4 000 000 would cover all the goods sold cheaper abroad than at home it was before he had reached the point in his speech where he proved that the selling of threetenths of 1 per cent of our goods cheaper abroad than at home enables our manufacturers to run their factories twelve months instead of nine just at this point the gentleman was urging that we only sold our surplus abroadthat we sent our surplus abroad because our manufacturers failed to find a market at homeand during a colloquy with the genleman from kentucky our distinguished colleague from pennsylvania made one of the most remarkable statements ever uttered on this floor in order that i might not do the gentleman an injustice i

transportation companies reach the seaboard the moment the transportation facilities which they own upon the sea are reached we say to them we will let you alone on the continent we are telling the

transportation companies on the land but when they start on the high seas we say to them here is 37 500 000 for you keep still and pay no attention to what we are doing to you on land where the people are we will make up what we take from you on land by giving you a hand out of 37 500 000 now that is exactly what congress is asked to do i am frank to say to the house that i do not believe it is an opportune time now to pass this legislation now let us analyze the merchant marine and fisheries committee and i desire to do so respectfully here are twelve republican memberq lour go out of congress in the closing days and there are eight remaining four of theeight remaining are against this measure four of the remaining members are for this provision four go out now four remaining for the bill four remaining against the amendment and as my colleague from illinois on the committee said not a syllable of evidence not a scintilla of evidence before the committee which sustains this bill that we are now discussing long since i learned from a distinguished jurist of my state if you are in doubt about a proposition how to vote vote no because you do not put anything into operation i think we ought to go back to our people and find out what they want on this proposition i think in these closing days of congress for this congress will soon end we ought to go hack to them and find out what they want with reference to this hand out as i call it not a ship subsidy it it was a ship subsidy i should be talking along a different line but this is not a ship subsidy no man dare stand before the american people in congress or out and call this a ship subsidy it is called a mail subsidy a hand out if you please to great corporations and trusts of the sum of 37 500 000 for carrying mail a part of which they have already agreed to o irry under existing contracts and to give them aldditional money for the doing of that which they have promised to do i think the wise and proper thing for
