with every other to form a symmetrical and perfect whole it is impossible to single out a special industry and subject it to the tide of foreign competition so as to reduce the price of the products of that industry nithout affecting the whole industrial fabric i do not believe in the protective tariff as a device for the protection of profits i do not believe in protecting profits as such i do not believe in protecting inefficiency i do not think it is possible to protect industry from competition in the art of the industry itself either at home or abroad i do believe in protecting and maintaining the higher standard of living that obtains in this country whether that standard is represented by direct and productive labor or the indirect contributions of the farmer the clerk the lawyer the doctor or the merchant whenever any industry is singled out to receive the special protection of the tariff whenever any industry is accorded a higher degree of protection than would equalize the difference in the standard of that industry at home and abroad the tariff becomes a mere special privilege and not a policy it can be a policy only when it is applied to all industry according to a definite measure on the other hand when duties are placed at a point which subjects industry to unequal and unfair competition from abroad it becomes merely an instrument of punishment and immunity may constitute no less a special privilege than the giving of direct and special benefits now in order to maintain the american market for the american producer and in order to equalize the difference in the standard under which goods are produced here and abroad it is necessary to be fully informed as to the conditions under which the goods are produced the relative cost of material and conversion into tile finished article the labor conditions which surround the industry the relative efficiency of machinery and workmen and the laws which encourage or discourage production or increase or diminish its cost a few days ago i received as i suppose every member of the house did a statement presented by an association representing the windowglass manufacturing companies of the united states purporting to give the costs of production of window glass here and abroad that statement showed the advantage to be greatly in favor of the foreign manufacturer i have no more doubt that the figures were accurate than i have that the men who made it were human being human i have no doubt they made it as favorable to their industry as the facts would permit they would have been less than just to the industry had they done otherwise the figures must either be accepted or rejected but would it not be wiser and more statesmanlike if instead of disregarding these figures and possibly placing the duty at so low a point as to cripple or destroy the industry or taking the figures at their face value and perhaps making the duty so high as to place a premium upon inefficiency we had provided ourselves with a nonpartisan commission equipped with power and machinery to learn and report the facts upon which congress might fix a rate intelligently if there is one thing more than another which marks the difference between the democratic and republican parties it is their respective attitude toward factsinformation the republican party believes in publicity at every stage of legislative procedure we have opened our party conferences to the public and the press we believe the public always acts intelligently when it is well informed publicity is valueless unless it is based on facts legislation is not only valueless but frequently absolutely destructive unless based on accurate information the republican party believes in scientific government it is in favor of a tariff based upon information not theory important as is the policy which shall govern the making of a tariff bill it is more important that we should have a tariff based upon information and that will conform to modern trade facts at home and modern world conditions abroad than that we should have a tariff either democratic or republican in other words the tariff should be made a scientific problem of equalizing the natural trade advantages of lower wage scales and standards of living and artificial stimulants and encourgements enjoyed by foreign countries rather than the football of political parties or the bone of contention of the supposedly opposing producers and consumers it is not my province to advise the majority but it is possibly not too great presumption to hope that when this bill has passed the democratic party will provide some adequate machinery for the determination of costs and prices here and abroad for determining trade facts and conditions and the other elements both natural and artificial which affect the relation of industry in this country to that of foreign countries with a view to the revision of the tariff from time to time schedule by schedule or item by item a the facts determined may require call it a tariff board a trade commission or whatever you will some instrumentality must be established equipped with power and authority to obtain the facts necessary to the proper preservation of our own commer te and its extension beyond the seas the prime necessity of the manufacturer is opportunity for continuous operation under normal conditions the prime necessity of the wage earner is continuous employment changes which interrupt the continuity of operation are destructive of industry changes which interrupt the continuity of employment of the wage earner are destructive of both his prosperity and his happiness radical and wholesale changes in the policy of our tariff laws must inevitably be injurious to the whole fabric of commerce and industry if there is one thing which the last congress established beyond dispute it is the efficacy and desirability of the schedule by schedule revision of the tariff such a revision permits of the consideration of the tariff upon allied products upon their own merits it prevents the brutalities and incongruities which inevitably result upon the logrolling which always accompanies a general revision of the tariff whether the general tendency of the revision is upward or downward it affords greater opportunity for real consideration schedules revised in this way will not be subject to the vagaries of sectionalism which aroe certain to characterize general revision the opportunity of the democratic party for real service did not lie so much in the revision of the tariff as in revision of the methods under which revisions have heretofore been accomplished it has failed miserably in this respect but it can still redeem its failure by providing machinery which will make the adoption of similar methods impossible for the futuv the democratic party has ever been a party of opposition it could earn a clear title to being a party of progress if it could lay aside for the nonce the desire for political advantage long enough to establish a really constructive method of tariff revision in its attempts to carry out its promise for a free market basket the democratic party has made the farmer the chief point of its attack against the high level of prices the farming industry has been singled out as the shining mark for the competition of foreign countries under the mistaken theory that the price of his commodities to the consumer may be reduced without affecting his prosperity as a producer the farmer is made the scapegoat of a weird attempt to apply an impossible theory to unknown conditions nothing could better illustrate the democratic tendency to write tariffs with absolute disregard for trade facts and conditions than this attempt it must result in failure either at one end or the other if the democratic party succeeds in lowering the price of agricultural products to the consunrr it will at the same time lower the level of prices of wages and commodities of other industries and ultimately the disturbances which the radical cuts proposed by the bill must inevitably produce will diminish the ratio of the difference between the value of what we produce and what we consume to the point of actual business depression and stagnation in the very first line of the agricultural schedule the farmer is presented with what purports to be a protective duty of 10 per cent ad valorem upon cattle his joy upon making this discovery will be short lived however upon further examination he will doubtless uncover the fact that the carcass hide hoofs and horns of cattle have been placed on the free list doubtless he will suppose when he reads that sheep are dutiable at 10 per cent ad valorem that it was the intention of the democratic party to protect the sheep industry by the same token his gratitude may be expected to be somewhat diminished when he learns that the flesh of the sheep the skin of the sheep and the wool of the sheep are admitted free of duty wheat is theoretically protected by a duty of 10 cents a bushel but bran and screenings are admitted free as is flour coming from countries which impose no duty upon our flour oats are protected by a duty of 10 cents a bushel but the product of oatsoatmeal and rolled oatsare placed on the free list potatoes come in free rye and rye flour free buckwheat and buckwheat flour free milk and cream free butter is reduced from 6 to 3 cents per pound cheese from 6 cents per pound an equivalent of 32 per cent ad valorem to 20 per cent ad valorem the farmer is alternately lifted to the mount of hope and plunged into th slough of despair the democratic moses leads him to the promised land only to leave him wandering in the wilderness the prey of his foreign competitors subsection 7 of paragraph j of the administrative section of the bill provides that a discount of 5 per cent on all duties imposed by this act shall be allowed on such goods wares and merchandise as shall be imported in vessels admitted to registration under the laws of the united sta tes perhaps the thdoretical satisfaction of the farmer over the theoretical protection of 10 cents per bushel on wheat will wane somewhat when he discovers that out of every dollar collected on wheat carried in an american registered ship from port arthur canada to buffalo across the great lakes 5 cents must be paid back to the importer it is difficult to understand the mental processes that justify a policy of discouraging home industry by inducing foreign competition and encouraging foreign industries by paying them a direct bonus it is not enough to encourage foreign competition but we must add to the injustice of the policy by paying a bonus to the importer after all it must be admitted that the price paid to the farmer has but very little to do with the cost of those articles to the consumer for the wool in a suit of clothes selling at retail at 23 the farmer receives 1 50 for the oats in a 5pound package of oatmeal costing 25 cents the farmer receives 7 cents for the pound of steak for which the consumer pays 28 cents the farmer receives 61 cents a reduction of 6 cents a bushel in the price of wheat would mean a reduction of threetwentieths of a cent in the cost of a loaf of bread in the main foodstuffs today are sold in small packages the s ze of these packages and the prices at which they are sold have been very largely standardized modern business conditions make it impossible that the size of these packages or the price of their contents should fluctuate with the price of the raw materials out of which they are made lower prices of the raw material are either absorbed in increased profits or by increased costs of selling in small quantities on the whole it is probably better both for the consumer and producer if prices can be caintained at a fairly constant level instead of being subject to daily or periodical fluctuation under modern conditions of trade clothes hats stockings shoesindeed nearly every article of everyday useare sold at a standard of quality and ht a standard price which admits of no opportunity to follow the fluctuations of the price of raw material it is perfectly idle to say that the reduction of the tariff can affect this situation if reduction in the tariff means a reduction in prices it means a reduction effected by lowering the standard of wages of prices and of living all down the line the remedy for this situation does not lie in a reduction of the tariff that remedy consists of better and more economic methods of distribution and arrangements among consumers that will enable them to buy in larger quantities and at the same time lessen the cost of both buying and selling as well as of delivery paragraph 198 provides for a duty of 10 cents per bushel on wheat paragraph 439 puts bran and screenings on the free list paragraph 647 puts wheat flour and semolina on the free list subject to the following proviso 647 wheat flour and semolina provided that wheat flour shall he subject to a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem whtn imported directly or indirectly from a country dependency or other subdivision of government which imposes a duty on wheat flour imported from the united states it is carefully explained by our democratic friends who desire to allay the wellgrounded fears of their farmer constituents that canada will not admit our flour free and thereby obtain access to the american market no party and no member of this house has the right to assume that canada will not take advantage of a provision so evidently written for her especial benefit if it is not intended that she should do so the provision should be stricken from the bill if it is intended that she should take advantage of it we must expect the natural consequences of her doing so no party has the right to ignore the facts and conditions to which a law is to be applied and at the same time expect to escape from the results of that disregard but the provision would be unfair to the milling industry of the united states even if the duty of 10 per cent on flour were absolute the usual computation requires 5 bushels of wheat to make i barrel of flour ten cents a bushel on wheat is equal to 10 per cent but on 60cent wheat it is equal to 16 7 per cent ad valorem on the other hand 10 per cent ad valorem on a barrel of flour made from 1 wheat would be 50 cents on flour made from 60cent wheat 30 cents the duty on the wheat in the flour in both cases remains at the same level50 cents a barrel this would mean a disadvantage of 20 cents a barrel against the american miller this disadvantage would be increased on the higher grades of flour requiring from 59 to 55 bushels of wheat to the barrel in milling flour the byproductbran shorts and so forthamounts to 30 per cent of the wheat as these byproducts are admitted free from canada the duty on wheat would mean a further disadvantage of 3 cents per bushel or 15 cents per barrel of flour represented by the duty on that part of the wheat which was turned into the byproduct au examination of the tuesday quotations of no 1 hard wheat at minneapolis and winnipeg covering the period from september 1 1909 to august 31 1911 shows that the average difference in price in favor of the minneapolis market amounts to 10 4 cents per bushel wheat would therefore seem to be sufficiently protected by a duty equivalent to 10 cents a bushel wheat is used almost exclusively for making flour and the high price of wheat is therefore dependent upon the market conditions and the trade facts which surround the marketing of flour in the production of wheat and manufacture of flour canada is our nearest and biggest competitor she will at once take advantage of the reciprocal provision in the law relative to flour in order to gain access to the tremendous market which our 90 000 000 of people affords it is a wellknown trade fact in the milling industry that in the establishment of a new mill the prime necessity is a market for the byproduct of flour bran shorts and so forth the pending bill furnishes the canadian miller with that primary market in the united states with a free market for his byproduct the canadian miller will start out with an advantage of 10 cents a bushel on the wheat in the flour since it takes from 44 to 5 bushels of wheatin some grades as high as 5i bushelsto make 1 barrel of flour this would mean an advantage of from 45 to 55 cents per barrel no industry no efficiency no business acumen can overcome this advantage it is obvious then that the miller must make a reduction either in wages or the price of his raw materialprobably both the price of wheat is necessarily in a large degree dependent on the price of flour and its byproducts v since the price of these commodities is to be fixed by direct competition with the products of other countries where the price of wheat is on a lower level than it is in the united states the price of wheat here must necessarily drop to the same level thus the theoretical duty on wheat will be nullified it is puerile to argue that the price of this commodity is governed by the law of diminishing returns or fixed at liverpool in the face of positive evidence of an actual difference in price between this country and canada of 10 cents per bushel and the admission of that difference evidenced by the imposition of a duty of 10 cents a bushel upon wheat this bill gives canada a natural market of 90 000 000 people in exchange for an economically impossible one of 8 000 000 people no indiana ohio illinois kansas missouri minnesota or other united states mills could sell its product in canada against mills buying their wheat in the lowestpriced primary wheat markets on the north apmerican continent because the cost of native wheat to these united states mills would be higher but even if prices were the samewhich is inconceivable because of the greater remoteness of canadian wheat territory from the seaboardbackhaul freight from the united states to canadian wheat territory would absolutely prohibit there are nearly 12 000 flour mills in this country scattered over 48 states it is a highly competitive industry it employs 350 000 000 capital at the least it should be entitled to a square deal the position of the millers and farmers is by no means unique they are but two of the many victims of the democratic policy of ignoring facts their situation but emphasizes the general character of the revision the plan seems to consist of reducing the duties at both ends if the duty on raw material is reduced the manufactured product is placed on the free list or at best the duty is so much reduced as to give the industry the merest chance of survival the gentleman from new york said that the democratic revisions of the last congress were accomplished with blacksmiths tools the instrument used in the present revision seems to have been an ax yet the gentleman from alabama has been true to the course he laid out the consumer has been his first consideration the industry seems to have been an afterthought the facts have not been considered at all the bill is full of inconsistencies and special benefits under the present law wool including mohair and the hair of the angora goat is dutiable at 11 cents a pound under the proposed bill wool is placed on the free list but the hair of the angora goat mohair and like products are singled out and provided with a special protective duty of 20 per cent and the manufactures of such hair by a duty of 40 and 50 per centthe highest in the entire wool schedule i had supposed that the donkey was the especial symbol and mascot of the democratic party and was at a loss to understand this sudden solicitude on the part of that party for the angora goat it occurred to me that the solution of the problem might be found in the location of the animal this subsequently proved to be correct for i found upon examination of statistics that of the 2 900 000 goats in this country 2 350 000 in round numbers were located in 18 southern states and of this number more than a million are in the state in part so ably represented by the gentleman from texas who recently became a member of the ways and means committee of course it is not possible that the fact that these is southern states are represented by 124 democrats and only 10 republicans could have had anything to do with the protection of the angora goat under the present law photogelatin printed matter is excel ted from the operation of paragraph 412 and made dutiable under paragraph 415 at 3 cents per pound and 25 per cent ad valorem the underwood bill makes the same exception in paragraph 412 but makes no separate provision so that photogelatin printed matter would be dutiable under that law as printed matter at 15 per cent ad valorem the paper used in this process is dutiable at 25 per cent as is also the gelatin the machines used are also imported and dutiable as a result germany can put the finished article into this country cheaper than our own manufacturers can buy the material a result less disastrous than the wiping out of the industry can hardly be anticipated from this provision burlap clothsbags and sacks made of burlap are protected by differentials equiv alent to u per cent under the underwood bill burlap bags and sacks are dutiable at the same rate as burlap cloth this puts the american producer of bags and sacks of burlap in direct competition with the burlap bag and sack manufacturers of india where most of the burlap cloth is made upon an equal basis although the american sack manufacturer labors under the disadvantage of a wage scale some 300 per cent higher than that paid in india the duty on umbrellas in the bill is lower than that on the parts of which they are made practically all of which are imported we are told that rates in the underwood bill are competitive in every line of ividusty the rates provided in the bill on cotton cloths in the graythat is cotton cloth not bleached dyed colored stained painted printed jacquard figured or mercerizedrun from 71 to 274 per cent ad valorem depending upon the fineness of the yarn in the fabric it is fair to assume that these duites are competitive cotton cloth bleached dyed colored and so forth is subject to a duty of 2j per cent in addition to the duties chargeable on the cloth in the gray the tariff board in its investigation of the cotton schedule found there was no difference in the cost of finishing cotton cloth in this country and in england the greatest cotton manufacturing country in the world the board said it will be seen from the table that in the case of most of the samples for which data were obtained for the two countries the american charges were lower in a few instances the american rates are only about onehalf the english the labor cost of mercerizing cotton fabrics varies from less than 0 08 of 1 cent to less than 0 11 of 1 cent per square yard while the total cost of mercerizing varies from more than 0 53 of 1 cent to over 0 72 of 1 cent per square yard the additional duty of 24 per cent on finished cotton cloths amounts to oneeighth of 1 cent per yard on cloth costing 5 cents per yard onefourth of 1 cent per yard on cloth costing 10 cents per yard onehalf of 1 cent on cloths costing 20 cents per yard 1 cent on cloths costing 40 cents per yard these amounts are in practically every instance more than the total labor cost per yard involved in finishing the cloths in some instances they are nearly as much as the total cost of finishing excluding material it must be apparent that if duties on cotton cloths in the gray are competitive the addition of 2 per cent on the same cloths finished would nake these duties prohibitive in ninny instances it is quite significant in this connection that the importation of cotton cloths in the gray have in the past been practically nominal while the importation of finished cotton cloths have been more substantial perhaps the cottonmill industry of the south is sufficiently protected after all the pending bill raises the duty on cotton yarn no 60 over the rate in the underwood cotton bill of last year from 15 to 20 per cent this is one of the greatest increases in the schedule on yarns is it altogether a coincidence that the importations of this count of yarn in 1910 were greater than those of any other number amounting to 1 263 000 pounds yarn no 50 on which the importatloas in 1910 were 330 773 pounds has been increased in duty from 10 to 171 per cent duty on cotton yarn no 40 upon which the importations for the same year were 461 017 pounds has been increased from 10 to 15 per cent the duties on yarn no 68 upon which the importations in 1910 were 767 614 pounds no 70 upon which importations were 2s6 761 pounds no 76 upon which the importations were 248 276 pounds and no 78 upon which the importations were 907 388 pounds have been raised from 15 to 20 per cent ad valorem in the proposed bill over the underwood bill of the last congress the duties on yarn no 100 of which 287 414 pounds were imported in 1910 have been raised from 15 to 25 per cent singularly enough yarns nos 40 50 60 and 100 fall into a classification taking a higher rate of duty than under the underwood bill of the last congress in other words the classification has been so changed as to make these counts of yarns upon which the importations were quite substantial fall into a classification taking a relatively higher rate than under the underwood bill of last year evidently the democratic party is not so anxious to induce importations and invite competition in the cotton industry as in the case of farming and other industries yet in almost every line the bill seems to evidence a purpose to cheapen the american market while holding out to the american producer the promise that the product of his labor and genius will not be diminished in value it would be neither wise nor kind to indulge in predictions as to the effect of this bill but if the democratic party has kept its promises to the people it will have accomplished the impossible task of reducing the cost of living to the consumer without reducing the price to the producer it will have transferred 1 40 000 000 of industry to foreign lands without affecting the prosperity of the american people or reducing the wages of american workmen but after all the mandate of the american people to the democratic party in 1910 and again in 1912 was to revise the tariff downward you have carried out that mandate whether you have done it well or ill the people must finally judge as republicans we think you have done it ill and we shall say so but as patriotic citizens we shall bear its results and share its burdens as patiently as we mayuntil a majority of the people shall again decree a change"],

to the fact that at no time in the history of this government except during the anthracite strike of 1003 when all coal was admitted to this country by law free of duty for one year which was a measure of emergency and expediency has bituminous coal ever been placed upon the free list recognizing that there is a popular demand for revising the tariff downward it will be noted that i have fixed the duty on bituminous coal at 40 cents per ton on coal slack or culm at 15 cents per ton and on coke at 20 per cent ad valorem the duties provided in the present law are 45 cents per ton on bituminous coal 15 cents per ton on coal slack or culm and 20 per cent ad valorem on coke i do not know whether it will have any weight or influence with the distinguished gentlemen on the other side of the aisle or not but permit me to inform you that the amount of duty on bituminous coal named in the proposed amendment is the same as that provided in the wilsongorman law while i think the present duties on bituminous coal coal slack culm and coke are none too high to adequately protect our great and growing bituminouscoal and coking industries and the many thousands of hardworking miners and their families who are dependent upon these industries for their livelihood and daily bread yet i have proposed to lower the duties provided by existing law to the figures named in the amendment which i have offered the great bituminouscoal and lignite producing states of this union are pennsylvania west virginia illinois ohio indiana kentucky alabama virginia colorado wyoming washington and montana the nations annual production of bituminous coal and lignite is about 406 000 000 tons the value of which in round numbers is 450 000 000 and in which production 555 000 men are engaged a higher wage scale and a higher production cost prevail in this country than in any other country in the world in british columbia and vancouver wages are from 30 to 50 per cent lower than in this country in nova scotia wages are from 20 to 25 ier cent lower than here and the average wages paid to coal miners in this country are more than double those paid in england while the hours of labor are much shorter i for one am unwilling to and will never vote to reduce the wages to lower the standard of living or increase the hours of labor of our american miners to those or that as the case may be of foreign countries while the wages of coal miners in this country and in the state of west virginia which i have the honor to humbly represent exceed those of any other section of the universe i earnestly desire our bituminous coal and coking industries to be made and kept so prosperous that coal miners will be as they should be the best paid laborers for the least nmnber of hours work of any of our industries and why not the coal miner is certainly a laborer worthy of his hire no employment is more hazardous or fraught with more danger no work more exacting and uncomfortable and no occupation more conducive to physical infirmity and loss of health and limb than his yet our democratic friends would place bituminous coal and coke on the free list and place in jeopardy the industries in which he is engaged since i have been here i have heard it asserted that with coal on the free list there would be no danger to our bituminous coal and coking industries from abroad that with the exception of canadian coals no other coals can be brought into competition with our coals let me remind you in this connection that during the great anthracite strike when all coals were placed upon the free list coal was imported from england as well as from canada and that the prices of coal in this country fell to such an extent that the bottom virtually dropped out of the domestic market while this country exports very little bituminous coal other than to canada the importation of coal from canada is increasing particularly from nova scotia british columbia and alberta canada imposes a duty of 45 cents per ton on all bituminous coal and lignite imported from this country yet the gentlemen on the other side would open without any reciprocal arrangement our markets free of duty to canadian coals the coals of british columbia and alberta directly compete with the coals and lignite of montana washington and wyoming and indirectly compete with those of utah alaska and north dakota while nova scotia coals compete with the coals of our eastern coalproducing states and particularly with the coals of west virginia a reciprocal arrangement with canada might be of benefit to the coal operators of western pennsylvania eastern ohio and perhaps northern west virginia because a considerable quantity of coal is shipped from the united states into ontario and that section of canada between montreal and winnipeg canada has no coal tributary to that area and is largely dependent upon coals produced in the united states for the adequate supply of that area the distance to said section is too great and the cost of transportation too high for successful competition by the coals of nova scotia an investigation will disclose however that no coals produced in this country can pay the canadian duty and successfully compete with the coals of nova scotia in the st lawrence market while my remarks so far have more particularly related to the country at large i desire to say a few words before the expiration of my limited time as to the probable effect of free bituminous coal on the southern part of west virginia and the district i represent the gentlemen on the democratic side seem to have some unsatisfying grudge against the great state of west virginia as would appear from the duties that they have agreed upon in the underwood bill to the new england manufacturers they have said we have partly compensated you for excessively lowering the duties on your manufactured products in this bill by giving you free raw wool free coal free lumber cheap raw cotton and so forth but no compensation do they offer or give to the state of west virginia and her people i want to call the attention of the gentlemen on the other side to the fact that nearly everything west virginia produces has either been placed on the free list or the duties thereon lowered to such a great extent that her industries will be either completely destroyed or seriously crippled in my humble opinion west virginia will be more severly hit and injured by the provisions of this bill than any other state in the union they propose to put coal wool and lumber on the free list and to reduce far below the protective principle duties on iron steel and tin plate glass and pottery cattle sheep wheat and other farm products besides other things which west virginia and her people largely produce and are vitally interested in west virginia has 826 coal mines and 36 coking plants employing over 73 000 people with an annual production value of about 60 000 000 upon which nearly onethird of the people of west virginia are dependent and directly sustained she has 62 glass and pottery plants employing over 1 000 ipeople with an annual production value of 11 000 000 she has 104 lumber plants employing 7 700 people with an annual production value of exceeding 18 000 000 she has 600 000 cattle and 900 000 sheep and the value of her stock and farm products exceeds 71 000 000 the democratic members of congress now propose to take away from her by admitting bituminous coal free of duty her new england coal market and to give the same unconditionally to nova scotia while the states of ohio and pennsylvania are very rich in bituminous coal yet west virginia contains more than both of them with that of virginia thrown in for good measure in southern west virginia there are three great bituminous coal fields namely the new river the kanawha and the pocahontas fields producing the highest grade of bituminous and semibituminous coals produced in the united states west virginia ranks second in the bituminous coal producing states and her annual production is about onesixth of that of the entire union the maintenance of west virginias coal production is largely dependent upon her retention of the new england market in which market over onethird of the entire coal production of the pocahontas and new river fields is consumed nova scotia is now contending vigorously for that market her mines are in their youthful period and although her coals are not as excellent as west virginia coals the latters coals can not successfully compete in new england against nova scotian and other foreign coals coming into this country free of duty in addition to the water haul on her coals to new england markets west virginia has to pay an overland haul of about onethird of 1 cent per ton per mile while nova scotia has very little overland haul to pay on her coals from the best figures obtainable it costs nova scotia only about 55 cents per ton to transport her coals to boston while it costs west virginia about 2 10 per ton to transport her coals to the same market while in heating units the new river and pocahontas coals of west virginia have an advantage of about 17 per cent over the coals of nova scotia yet this advantage will be quickly overcome by nova scotian coals in lower selling prices if nova scotia is not required to pay any import duty thereon canada evidently does not think that there is any great disparity in the value of the coals of west virginia and nova scotia because she burns the coals of nova scotia in preference when she can get them as cheaply as she can the coals of west virginia i would like to see west virginia lessen the hours and increase the wages of her miners if west virginia is to be deprived of the new

contained 375 000 lt acres of santa fe land also these 375 000 acres were also n mostly worthless but in the name of conservation and with es the active assistance of the forest service for these 375 000 as acres of worthless land the santa fe railroad was permitted to n select 380 000 acres of the best of the public lands that yet n remained it was afterwards discovered that through some mists take they had been allowed to take 5 000 acres too much but d so far as i have been able to discover this little insignificant error was never corrected thus more than a million and a quarter acres of our best public lands were given in the name of conservation to the santa fe railroad for practically no consideration whatever is it any wonder that the officials of the santa fe railroad were great conservationists although the commissioner of public lands was constantly protesting that the public was being robbed by these transactions and that the department of the interior had no legal right to permit such agreements to be consummated the conservationists were not to be deterred they did not however restrict their favors entirely to the railroads they were exceedingly generous in these gifts of the public lands to private corporations a company owned 48 000 acres in california the city of santa barbara cal said it would be a splendid thing to have this strip included in a forest reserve in order to protect their water supply the commissioner of public lands said that if the city would buy this strip he would be glad to recommend that it be included in the forest reserve and stated as shown by the records in the case that such land was worth only about 40 cents an acre and that for the government to include it in a forest reserve and give lieuland scrip therefor would be a great injustice to the government but those who were interested in the transaction ably assisted by the forest service objected and the transaction in spite of the protests of the commissioner of public lands was consummated and this private corporation was permitted to give this 48 000 acres of 40cent land to the united states and to select therefor 48 000 acres of the best nontimbered public land in all the public domain and that of course was done in the name of the people and conservation but the forest service and the railroads having so successfully conserved the resources of the southwest having permitted the santa fe railroad to trade the great rattlesnake playground of the nation for the best public lands beneath the flag were anxious like alexander of old for more land to conquer and more forests to conserve these friends of the people discovered that there were other railroads that had worthless lands and that there were still parts of the public domain that contained forest lands of great value the clamor of save the forests for the people was growing louder more railroads were becoming interested more railroad money was being put into the propaganda the great captains of the northwest were encouraged by the success of the great captains of the southwest the railroads and the forest service turned their patriotic eyes toward the great pacific northwest here millions of acres of virgin forest some of the most valuable of all this earth still remained the property of the nation mingled with this public land were many acres of fine timberland belonging to the northern pdcific railway that it had received under the land grant from congress but here also the northern pacific owned some barren rocky mountain tops utterly worthless except for scenery of course these facts did not escape the attention of the conservationists the railroad men of the northwest as well as the railroad men of the southwest were active and influential in the conservation movement they contributed the sinews of war that added strength to the chorus that the forests should be preserved they demanded that the government should create forest reserves in the northwest where there was timber as they had created them in the southwest where there was none these railroad men joined by weyerhaeuser and other great conservationists were so patriotic that they were not only ready and willing to raise their voices but the cash to save the forests for the people the mount rainier national park was created and for this act aiding and abetting the conservationists congress is directly responsible then by executive order the pacific forest reserve was created in these two creations mostly in the pacific forest reserve were included 450 000 acres of barren and practically worthless land belonging to the northern pacific railway this land was largely the crests of high mountain ranges above timber line much of it covered by glaciers and eternal snows none of it of much value then the old familiar transaction took place for these worthless acres with the consent and the assistance of the forest service the northern pacific was permitted to select 450 000 acres of the best timbered land in america worth today at the least calculation 10 000 000 according to the estimate of the bureau of corporations it would be worth 50 000 000 this vast tract

"this congress will soon expire by limitation of law it may be that as a young man serving my first term i am more deeply impressed with the work we have done than are those of longer service but be that as it may i venture the assertion that this congress has enacted more constructive legislation than any conigress that has convened in half a century it is a source of gratification to me that the congress in which i am serving my first term has such a splendid record of achievement and yet in spite of the pride i feel for the things we have lone i deeply regret that we have not legislated upon another subject that to my mind is of equal if not greater importance than either the tariff currency trust regulation or trade commission and that is the pressing need for a rural or farm credit system i shall not undertake at this time to discuss in detail the question of farm credits but i shall confine myself to a brief consideration of what is meant by the term rural credits a statement of some of the necessities for such legislation and meet some of the objections that are made by those who oppose it the term rural credits is generally used to designate any system of financial machinery whereby funds are furnished to meet the peculiar and special needs of the farmers upon such terms and at such a rate of interest as not to prove burdensome farm credit is divided into two classes longterm or land credit which is briefly defined as credit to meet the capital requirements of the farmer and shortterm or personal credit which is briefly defined as credit to meet the current or annually recurring needs of the farmer the establishment of some system of longterm or land credit for the farmer is the object of most of the bills pending on this subject and i shall confine what i have to say to that branch of the subject and by using the term farm credits or rural credits i shall mean simply land credits for farmers whereby they procure longtime loans secured by mortgages on their land drawing a low rate of interest the loan to be repaid by the payment of not only the interest each year but a small part of the principal an amount so small that it will not be a serious burden to him and yet so large that in a given term of years the entire debt is paid and his mortgage canceled this plan of loans which is known as the amortization plan has been tested in nearly every civilized country in the world and proved a success by such a plan the farmer avoids the anxiety caused by the fear that when his debt comes due he will not be able to either pay it or renew it but will be forced to lose his home by foreclosure under the amortization plan of loans which has proved a success in other countries the farmer pays no more each year than the average american farmer now pays in interest for illustration let us take one of the german landcredit plans to which attention has been called by senator fletcher who was a member of the rural credit commission that visited europe a few years ago the rates of interest generally in germany are higher than they are in this country yet under a farmcredit system in germany on a loan to a german farmer made at 4 per cent interest there is added threefourths of 1 per cent for amortization onefourth of 1 per cent to cover operating expenses of the system or a total of 5 per cent annually and by paying this amount each year for a given number of years the entire debt was paid and his mortgage canceled the american farmer pays 8 or 10 per cent interest per annum on the mortgage on his farm the loan of the german farmer is in fact an investment he can afford to borrow money to buy a farm or improve a farm at that rate the american farmer is in debt the german farmer is using his credit each year while paying 5 per cent on the money received the german farmer is getting out of debt while the american farmer is paying 10 per cent and not reducing his debt a penny but it is urged by those who oppose farmcredit legislation in this country that conditions are different here to those in europe and that a system of land credits applicable to european conditions under european forms of government is not applicable to conditions in the united states and can not be provided under our form of government of course both conditions and forms of government are different here to those in europe and i do not propose that we adopt for this country any system now used in europe but i deny that under this great democratic government republican in form founded primarily as declared in the preamble to our constitution to promote the general welfare we are without power to provide the american farmer with such financial facilities as are necessary to meet the special needs of his economic conditions the contention that under our constitution this government is powerless to meet this grave problem and solve it is a sad commentary upon our form of government the solution of this problem has not been beyond the powers of the republic of france the kingdoms of great britain and italy the empires of austria and germany and the autocracy of russia and yet those who oppose farmcredit legislation say that it is beyond the constitutional power of this a democratic government i repeat if this contention be true then what a sad commentary upon our boasted republican form of government those who make this contention find themselves in the ludicrous position of saying that we have constitutional power to give direct aid to the farmer by furnishing him free seeds but not the power to directly aid him in procuring the land in which to plant them the power to supply funds for agents to teach him how to till the soil but no power to aid him by furnishing him with financial facilities by which he will be assisted in buying the soil the power to grant millions of acres of the public domain to the railroads of this country the power to spend hundreds of millions to aid the commerce of the world by building the panama canal the power to pour unnumbered millions into the development of alaska for the building of railroads the power to spend millions for the building of government ships as we propose in the shippurchase bill but no power to provide the farmers of this country with a separate financial system adapted to their economic needs oh ifthis be true then what a peculiar instrument is this our constitution those who hold this view do not question the constitutional authority to loan to the banks of this country millions out of the treasury at 2 per cent yet rush to the defense of the con stitution when it is proposed to furnish to the farm builders such credit facilities as the great economic need of the nation demands the only constitutional objection that some gentlemen have ever offered to loaning money to the banks has not been to the loan of the money but to the requirement that the banks should pay interest on these loans oh but they indignantly cry out that the government does not loan its money to the banks but just deposits it well why not provide the american farmer with proper agencies adapted to furnishing him needed credit facilities and deposit with these agencies some of this money to say it is possible under european forms of government for them to provide as they have separate systems of financing the special needs of their farmers and that it is impossible under our form of government to safely provide a separate sys tem of financing the needs of the american farmer applicable to his conditions is a severe indictment of our system of gov6rnment those who thus indict and condemn our form of government are either ignorant of the spirit aid character of our system of government or else they are ignorant of and indifferent to the needs of agriculture in this country and have no concep tion of the fact that the prosperity and security of this country depend upon the prosperity of the producing classes the first great economic duty of a nation is to feed and clothe itself and any form of government is inherently weak and defective if under its limitations its legislative department can not by providing proper credit facilities procure capital funds on reasonable terms for its producers and thereby enable and assist them by their labor and by their own initiative perform this great duty i denythat our form of government makes it impossible to discharge this great duty i believe the american congress has ample authority to provide an american system of rural credits american in form american in spirit and so framed as to meet american economic conditions and afford proper credit facilities in an american way to meet the needs of the american farmer i shall not at this time discuss any particular plan some two years ago i outlined a plan which i think safe sound and practical and in keeping not only with the customs and practices of this country but certain to provide ample funds for the american farmer at a reasonable rate of interest and upon long terms without disturbing the system of commercial credits and commercial banking now existing but i repeat that i shall not undertake to discuss any particular plan because my prime purpose upon this occasion is not to impress upon you the merits of any pet plan of my own but to urge the necessity for some plan and meet the objections that have been offered to every plan i have no particular pride of opinion and will not refuse to take any plan because i can not get my own but if tthis congress recognizes the necessity for and the wisdom of enacting ruralcredit legislation i feel sure that we shall be able to agree upona plan by making mutual concessions as to details so i shall not stop at this time or be diverted from a discussionof the main question by engaging in a dispute as to the relative merits of ithe different plans proposed but shall resume consideration of the objections that are offered to this class of legislation the principal opposition to ruralcredit legislation is placed upon the ground that there is no necessity for any such legislation we are told by those who oppose this legislation that the american farmer is sturdy independent selfreliant and prosperous and through present banking facilities his needs are being fully met and in fact some contend that he is more prosperous than other classes i heard one of these distinguished gentlemen in discussing hi s opposition to farmcredits legislation state that he did not see why there was any demand for this legislation as the farmers in his part of the country could get all the money they wanted for 5 and 6 per cent and that as a matter of fact most of the farmers in his territory own the banks and have money loaned out at interest another gentleman has called attention to the fact that last summer he addressed a large gathering of farmers in his district and that hundreds of automobiles were parked around the meeting place which automobiles were owned by the prosperous farmers and in which theyrode to and from the meeting it may be true that in some parts of the country the farmers as a class are exceedingly prosperous that they are wealthy that they follow the plows during the week days and ride in expensive automobiles on sunday it maybe they have a great deal of surplus money saved up that they own the banks of their communities and that out of their surplus funds make individual loans to relieve the distress of the merchants the lawyers the doctors and the manufacturers in their sections i say this may be true because reputable men havestated that these conditions are true in their communities but i deny that such isthe conditionof the farming classes of the country as a whole let us for a moment consider the facts as to agriculture in this country in 1880 according to the federal census over 70 per cent of the population of the united states was classified as agricultural in 1910 the federal census shows only 53 per cent of the population so classified a close analysis of these statistics will show that these figuresare misleading for the facts are in many parts of the countryfarm lauds have been abandoned until now only 28 per cent live on the farm and each year sees a greater number of young men of theagricultural classes leaving the farms and going to the towns and cities and in addition the number of farm home owners of this country is becoming fewer and fewer and the number of the tenant class is very rapidly on the increase so heavy has become the burden upon the farming classes staggering under the heavy load they have to bear forced to finauc e their operations by an expensive commercial financial system that the tendency is away from home owning and toward absentee landlordism i recently heard a great agricultural expert of this house who hasgiven a great deal of thoughtand investigation to the changing conditions of farm life in analyzing the statistics presented by the last federal census state that if the present drift were not checked and conditions were not relieved in less than 50 years time 20 per cent of the people of this country would be called upon to feed and clothe the remaining 80 per cent this is the only civilized nation upon the face of the earth that has not recognized and acted upon the necessity of a separate system of financing for its agricultural classes by pro viding a separate system of financing for the farmers of this country we will not accord to them a special privilege which is chargedby some of those who are vehement in theiropposition to this legislation we have provided a system of financing for the commercial interests of this country the prime object of that financial system being as stated over and over by its proponents to furnish credit facilities that would meet the expanding and contracting needs of commerce if that be true that our present financial system is shaped entirely to meet the shortterm credit demands of commerce then if we provide facilities which will supply the longterm credit demands of the american farmer we will not be granting to him a special privilege but we shall only be doing him equal justice and according to him equal facilities the man who says that the present commercial banking system of this country can carry the load of american agriculture and safely furnish the capital requirements of the american farmer upon terms that will not be a burden is either ignorant of the very law that underlies a commercial bank and necessarily controls its operation or else he is ignorant of the economicneeds of the agricultural classes the very law of thebeing of a commercial bank is to furnish shortterm credits to facilitate and furnish a medium of exchange for the daily transactions of the commercial world the law of necessity requires the commercial bank to keep its assets liquid so that it can at all times be ready to meet the demand obligations of its depositors and furnish the bulk of its capital it would be unwise and it would be unsafe for a commercial bank to fly in the face of this necessity and jeopardize the safety of its institution by loaning out its deposits upon longterm credits assuming that the commercial bankers are doing the best they 1915 can for agriculture yet the law of their being and the necessities of the commercial world make it impossible for them to meet to the fullest extent the necessary demands of agriculture fortunately a great many of the bankers of the agricultural states recognize this fact and are strong advocates of ruralcredit legislation one of these country bankers in discussing this proposed legislation stated that while it would primarily be ofgreatest benefit to the farmers it would also benefit the country banks for the reason that by a proper ruralcredit system lowrate investment funds from the north and east would be brought into the agricultural communities of the south and west by these longterm loans to farmers and these funds thus brought in would swell the current funds of the community increase the amount of circulation per capita in these commitnities and enable the country bankers in the agricultural towns to more readily meet the needs of commercial operations in these communities and make it easier for the country banker to meet the shortterm annual demands of the farmer upon easier terms there is no question but that this country banker has the right view there is no question but that all classes in the parts of the country where agricultural lands are being developed and farm homes are being built would profit greatly by this influx of lowrate longterm investment money this country banker stated that the proper function of a commercial bank is to gather up the scattered cash in its community and honvert this cash into banking credit selling the same to its borrowers while the capital demands of the farmers are just the reverse in that they need to gather up the scattered credits made up of the loans of the farmers and convert these scattered credits into cash those who say there is no necessity for this class of legislation and that the present federal reserve act furnishes ample credit facilities for the farmer are few in number president wilson recognizes the necessity and the inadequacy of the present system which he clearly set forth in a statement which appeared in the newspapers on august 13 1913 in this statenent he said that the proposal to include in the then pending federal reserve act provisions for the facilitation of such credits as the farmers in the country most stand in need ofthat is agricultural credits as distinguished from ordinary commercial and industrial creditswere not adopted because such credits could only be imperfectly provided for in such measure in addition he further stated in the same newspaper statement thatthe scope and character of the bill its immediate and chief purpose could not be made to reach as far as the special interests of the farmer require special machinery and a distinct system of hanking must be provided for if rural credits are to be successfully and adequately supplied president wilson in this same statement in discussing the necessities for ruralcredit legislation and pointing out the serious disadvantages under which the american farmer is laboring said oneof the chief and most serious of these disadvantages has been that he has not been able to secure the extended bank accommodations he every year stands in need of without paying the most burdensome rates of interest and saddling himself with mortgages and obligations of every kind which he fairly staggered under if he could carry them at all in other countries systems of rural credit have been put into operation which have not only relieved the farmer but have put his enterprises upon a footing of easy accomplishment countries in which agriculture was fatally languishing because wholly unprofitable have seen their farming lands blossom again and their people turn once more hopefully to the soil for a living our farmers must have similar means afforded tha u of handling their financial needs easily and inexpensively they should be furnished these facilities before their enterprises languish not afterwards and they will be this is our next great task and duty another objection that is urged against ruralcredit legislation is that it will furnish the farmers with cheap money and those who offer this argument in opposition to ruralcredit legislation say that the american farmer is improvident and has no business sense and that he will borrow too much lnd ruin himself if the rate of interest is lower the farmers of my state are just as intelligent and capable as the farmers of illinois and indiana where they can get money at 41 and 5 per cent has cheap money ruined the farmers of illinois and indiana again some of those who are opposed to ruralcredit legislation with a great deal of solicitude for the farmer warn him against the dangers to him involved in this legislation and try to make him believe that it is a scheme to involve him in debt and ruin him while it is true that some farmers are improvident and will go too deeply in debt if given too much credit the same is true of many merchants lawyers doctors and other classes the fact is that the great majority of farmers are compelled to go in debt each year and are left with no choice the young farmer starting out in life and the tenant who owns no land can not procure a home without going in debt the right kind of ruralcredit legislation will not only not ruin the farmer by tak ing his home away from him as some would make him believe but would so far as land credits are concerned protect those who already own homes but which are mortgaged for a short time at a high rate of interest against loss by foreclosure on account of crop failure or other misfortune he would be protected under a proper ruralcredit system by having his debt turned into an amortized loan so that by payments that are not burdensome he could ultimately discharge his obligations some object to legislation of this kind insisting that it is a matter that should be left strictly to private capital and that no government aid should be given basing their objections upon their statement that the american farmer is not a serf as the agriculturists of europe are classed by them one of these gentlemen says that to call an american farmer a peasant would be to insult him those who offer this objection to any government aid simply offer the same argument and the same objections that those who are opposed to any ruralcredit legislation offer and therefore this objection demands consideration both of the objectors who make this argument show thereby that they are ignorant of the great economic necessity upon which the intelligent thoughtful sincere advocate of rural credit bases his demand for and justifies such legislation it is true that the american farmer is neither a serf nor a peasant in the sense that these terms are applied to certain classes in europe the term serf or peasant as commonly used in europe means a person who is bound to work on a certain estate and is thus attached to the land and sold with it into the service of whoever purchases the land true the american farmer does not belong to thisclass but if the economic burden that rests upon ills shoulders is permitted to continue and no proper financial facilities are afforded him with which to meet his necessities little by little as the census reports show he will be forced froln the homeowning prosporous class into the tenant and povertystricken class and in the course of the years if such drift is not checked many will become economic serfs what produced the peasant of europe what drove the agricultural classes of europe into serfdom did the condition of serfdom follow the law enacted or decrees promulgated governing this class or did these laws and lecrees simply follow the econonic and industrial conditions that so ground down the husbandman that the passing of tile laws and the promulgation of the decrees were naught but formal assertion of restraints that economic distress had already imposed the civilized countries of europe by their efforts for the past 50 years to renedy the industrial conditions surrounding their agricultural classes by the establishment of ruralcredit agencies have but been applying a remedy for an evil that existed which evil should have been prevented europe by this class of legislation is lifting from the mire of intolerable conditions her agricultural classes while upon the other hand those who seek this legislation in this colutry seek it not because the american farmer is a peasant or a serf but because they do not want the the american farmer to ever become either a peasant or a serf we propose to so provide for agriculture in this country that the american farmer will continue intelligent upright selfreliant and productive and linot permit the burden of intolerable economic conditions to force him to the last extremity before we recognize his necessities and make the same l rovision for him that we have long since made for our commercial classes i have as best i could in the brief time perilitted discussed some of the necessities for this legislation and answered some of the objections that are offered by those who oppose it for some time i have recognized and called attention to the necessity for farmcredit legislation and when i entered this congress beginning my first term and the coalimittee on banking and currency of which i am a member took up the question of reforming the banking and currendy laws i insited that it was just as important to provide financial machinery adapted to the needs and requirements of agriculture as it was to reform our banking and currency laws so as to more fully meet the needs and requirements of commerce and that ruralcredit legislation should go hand in hand with the proposed federal reserve act i and those of us who were interested in this question pressed our contentions vigorously both in the committee aud on the floor of the democratic caucus and while president wilson and a majority of the democrats admitted the necessity for this character of legislation they insisted that they were not ready to act wisely and that it would be better to frame a ruralcredit law separate and apart from the federal reserve act at that time president wilson in a statement which appeared in the newspapers in discussing the proposal for a ruralcredit system said it should have accompanied and gone hand in hand with thd reform of our banking and currency system if we had been ready to act wisely with fullknowledge of what we were about 11 finding that a majority of the democratic catcus agreed with the president that the scope and character of the federal reserve act were limited to the needs of commerce and that its immediate and chief purpose could not be made to reach as far as the special interests of the farmer require and that they seemed to be in perfect accord with the presidents statement that special machinery and a distinct system should be provided for the farmers and as he stated that he regarded such legislation as ournext great task and duty as i have above quoted him i offered a motion inthe democratic caucus directing the committee on banking and currency to prepare a ruralcredit bill and report the same to the next session of congress which was to convene the following december the caucus gave such instructions and i at that time didnot for a moment doubt that these directions would be obeyed by the committee i thought that with the president of the united states urging the necessity for legislation of this kind and with him stating that he regarded it as our next great task and duty and knowing that the democrats of congress were willing to carry out his suggestions with reference to matters of legislation i felt confident that this congress would perform that great task and discharge the great duty which he said was our next one pursuant to the instructions of the democratic caucus the committee on banking and currency appointed a subcommittee on rural credits headed by the gentleman from ohio mr bulkley1 which subcommittee took up the question and after considerable hearings and working with a like subcommittee of the senate committee on banking and currency they jointly framed what has become known as the bulkleyhollis bill i immediately insisted that the full committee should take tip this question and consider it and if we did not favor the plan proposed by the subcommittee the full committee should frame some other plan and present the same to the house for its consideration and action i regret that i have been unsuccessful in my efforts to get this question considered by the full committee at every meeting i have insisted that we take up the ruralcredit question and report a bill to the house and i feel sure that if the full committee will but take up the question we can agree upon a bill and report it to this house within two or three days time and thenit wouldbe proper to provide for its consideration by a special rule which expedient has been resorted to in order to pass a great many other bills through this house by doing this we can yet have time to pass a ruralcredit bill at this session of congress and if we do not consider and enact such legislation at this session of congress and we have an extra session which now seems probable i shall renew my efforts in behalf of this legislation and shall not be content until by the enactment of a bona fide real practical ruralcredit system we shall have given to the american farmer the financial facilities to which he is justly entitled and which are necessary in order that he may be placed upon an equal footing with the privileges enjoyed by the commercial interests of the country under our present banking and currency laws why should we longer delay this legislation why should we longer deny to the american farmer a ruralcredit system which would not only be a blessing to him give renewed strength to his arm kindle anew the fires of hope in his heart but by the increased productiveness and the increased prosperity that would come from his renewed energies bring increased prosperity and plenty to every class during the last few weeks we have been engaged in the consideration of the appropriation bills for the annual support of our army and navy these bills together carry about a quarter of a billion dollars and during their consideration a determined effort was made by some who come from the manufacturing and commercial centers to increase the expenditures and thereby add to the burden of the american taxpayers under the specious plea of national defense i am for national defense but i do not think that the requirements for national defense are limited to an adequate navy i am not afraid of the foe from without with whose threatened and imaginary invasions gentlemen try to excite us into spending increased millions for our military establishment but i do as one who loves his country and gives some thought to its continued prosperity and safety havefears of the canker and deterioration that always flow from economic distress and industrial injustice no one honors more than i do the men who have fought our battles upon the land upon the sea noone has a greater pride in the valorous achievements of the american soldier and sailor to whom we affectionately refer as the man behind the gun but there are others of whom i think and for whose welfare i plead and in whose welfare and prosperity are wrapped the safety and security of this republic and they are not the men behind the guns but are the men behind the plows and the men in the overalls during the past 20 years we have spent upon the american army and navy something less than 5 000 000 000 and as compared to this sum all of which has been wrung from the overburdened taxpayers of this land the few millions that have been spent in aid of the american farmer seem insig nificant and small while these expensive battleships each costing many millions and our standing army are maintained in idleness and their officers live a life of luxury and ease the american farmer stooped beneath the burden of his load by his taxes supports them and at thesame time feeds and clothes the nation and with his surplus furnishes us with a balance of trade in our dealings with the nations of the earth is it not time we did something to lighten the burden of the american farmer and equip him with suchcredit facilities as will enable him to more easily develop the agricultural resources of the country is it not true that should war come the battle ships and the standing armies alone will not constitute our defense but our real defense will be the farmer and his fellow toilers who in every age and in every land and in every period of the history of thi s republic have fought the nations battles aand borne thebrunt of war i say it is the farmer who not only in time of peace brings the balance of trade to our shores but it is the farmer who in time of war bares his breast in defense of the country he loves it is the farmers wife and the farmers mother who kisses her stalwart husband or her brightfaced boy goodby and facing the heartache and the toil the loneliness and sorrow the danger of the isolated country life tells him to go down to the red red field of battle and if need be give his life for the common weal the hand that guides the plow in time ofpeace is the hand that grips the musket in time of war john trotwood moore has eloquently described this hand he says it is a hard hand it is true but itis faithful and honest and in its rough grip more gentleness dwells more truth and honor lie than in many another of softer grip andfiner strain it may be rough like the roots of the oak twisted and hardened gnarled and knotted in the primal fight for life with the elements of nature but unbeautiful as it is it has borne its full burden in the fight of civilivation and the battle of the world it may be misshapen and its joints largefrom strain and toil and the veins may run through it like the channels 6f a stream deep cut and it may be curved in like the turn of a plow handle and shaped like the grip of an ax helve toil worn and scarred it is this hand that not only each year feeds and clothes our vast population but it is this hand that lights the fires in every forge turns the countless wheels of industry everywhere girds the continent with glittering threads of steel and hurrying steeds of fire lmakes white the seas of earth with sails of commerce and pours upon all lands and all peoples in every human pursuit the blessings and prosperity which its toil has wrought from the earth it is for the purpose of making the tasks and the burdens of this hand lighter that i plead for ruralcredit legislation not only does justice to the farmer demand that you grant him this relief but the prosperity and future of this nation require that you no longer permit him to be handicapped by the financial shackles that now bind him will you by the enactment of this legislation break those bonds and set him free"], [0.032937128096818924, 0.032937128096818924, 0, "mr chairman and gentlemen of the house i find myself in many respects quite in accord with the gentleman from the philippines who has just spoken i can indorse a great deal that he said especially if i am permitted to add a few words like him i have minimized the reports of an insurrection in the philippine islands like him i do not believe the intelligent people in the philip pine islands are now working for a revolution or an insurrection or in any way countenancing it like him i know that anything like a revolutionary propaganda in the philippine islands today would be absolutely destructive of the best interests of the filipinos and many of them know it unlike him however i can notclose my eyes to certain things of near moment and grave concern disclosed by these reports but no final opinion should be formed upon the fragments of information thus far available and i join with selor quezon in eagerly awaiting thai more complete information in time sure to coie advising us of the exact nature of this insurrectionark 62 movement informing us of the names of the leaders and the extent of the disaffection but without waiting for another word of information i can indorse what he said and what gov gen harrison said that no distinguished leading fillpinos were implicated in the movement and i do not for one moment believe they will be nevertheless we should not close our eyes to these disturbances they are not to be cast aside with a joke and a sneer they have a serious mighty serious aspect and we must meet these facts as they are i say this with all the sincerity i can command having regard to the interests of the filipinos themselves a sporadic insurrection in the philippine islands is nothing new to this season it is nothing new to this administration or to this year even while i was there but little more than a year ago across the bay at zambales in the mountains 65 men or thereabouts started an insurrection with two shotguns they called it an insurrection they were all rounded up and captured and taken to prison but most of them let out because they were simply misguided individuals and i could only think of the time when i myself as a boy joined some neighborhood boys and ran away we stayed away one whole night but came back hungry in the morning this socalled insurrection is not indicative of anything nationwide or fundamentally of grave concern but is indicative of the fact that certain classes ofthe filipino people are very easily aroused easily misled and easily made to play a false part by designing leaders not infrequently during past years there have been seditious movements sporadic local with no welldefined purpose all of which havebeen easily put down and more or less smiled at because there has been a strong stable protecting government ever since the american occupation this is not the first occurrence of late two months ago a filipino servant notified his employer in manila of a definitely planned insurrection the papers in this country have said not a word about it secretary riggs took prompt action placed constabulary in the disaffected region and quashed any possible revolutionary spirit before it really burst forth the governor general mr harrison ordered the constabulary home peremptorily saying the alleged uprising was a joke recent events disclose that secretary riggs was right and the governor general was wrong a short time ago the administrative people in the philippine islands were shocked when there occurred what you might call an insurrection at the luahig penal colony on the island of palanan where honor prisoners of bilibid are grouped as colonists there have been several of these insurrectionary ebullitions during the past few months i think they teach an important lesson the lesson is important to our democratic brethren especially but i do not suppose they will take it strongly to their hearts after i came back from the islands a year ago i said on numerous occasions that there would be work for the army of the united states and for the scouts and the constabulary in the islands within about a year unless some things were stopped i find that what i said has come true it is important for us on this occasion to consider what the things were the forces then observed that in my opinion should have been stopped one of the things that was notorious and that ought to have been stopped was the spreading broadcast among the people of a disrespect for the american flag you can not call it anything else when this administration got into full swing there was unconsciously given to the people the idea that to criticize to belittle to arraign to condemn to cry out against that which had been done by the american government in the islands was to display good judgment and an easy way to win favor with the new authorities i have heretofore called the attention of the house to this important fact the inevitable result was that filipinos lost respect for american sovereignty this loss of respect has manifested itself in many press utterances and has now found expression in sporadic and puerile insurrection against our authority no particular harm was done as long as the new spirit was confined to the educated the selfreliant and the selfcontained but all harm followed when it was utilized by renegade rascals like ricarte inflamed and infuriated spreading in and utilized in a revolutionary propaganda this man ricarte has been carrying on this propaganda for several yearshe and others like him he was deported because he refused to recognize or obey american sovereignty formerly the work of this man and those of his ilk has been easily suppressed by a vigilant and efficient constabulary who form a very effective military body nobody paid much attention to these little ebullitions the men engaged in the work never got very far they were apprehendedand amputated from their beguilement of the simpleminded native into the treacherous avocation of a revolutionist but recently during the past year ricartes men and others engaged in the same business have been very much more active have grown vastly bolder have seized the antiamerican feeling begotten by the policies and utterances of this administration when it was first instituted seized hold of this wanton spirit directed its activities and brought forth an insurrection that really requires immediate and vigorous attention the other lesson taught by this incipient insurrection is more important yet of late in the islands all men seeking election to any political office either important or insignificant have been preaching independence the people engaged in political activities have taken their cue from their leaders like seflor quezon and seflor osmefia and have vigorously promised the people to work for independence furthermore these candidates for office have promised the people that when the democratic party secures control of the american government philippine independence will at once follow independencia immediatiste has recently been preached with redoubled vigor it was my belief when i left the islands that real trouble would follow consequent upon this they greatly overtrained in their independence talk in fact i told some of the leaders i believed trouble would follow it would follow because they knew and 1 knew that the democratic party would not could not grant independence to the islands during any period near at hand furthermore immediate independence would be shunned like the plague by the leading thinking filipinos if there was real danger that it might come at once so it seemed to me then that when the ignorant among the filipinos who had been so liberally fed on independence promises found there was to be no redemption of those promises now their disappointment might not be curbed except by the use of force that is exactly what happened disguise it as you will there has been keen bitter disappointment among many filipinos especially in and around manila over the failure of the jones bill now pending to grant independence outright the better class of filipinos are not among them the real able leaders of the filipinos are not among them they are almost devoid of leadership hardly armed at all but outbreaks of this character may be expected in different parts of the islands theie is another lesson we should not overlook we here all minimize this insurrectionary movement and why because there is in the islands and over the islands today a strong stable beneficent government that will protect life and property that will preserve peacethe government of the united states were that government not there what chaos might result i was very glad that the gentleman from the philippine islands today did not repeat what he is credited in the press as saying that this insurrectionif you want to call it that although i do not wish to dignify it by too vigorous a namehas been stirred up by american interests in the island

offense of this character nor the effort to postpone the speedy trial of offenders then the district attorney says in these cases two girls were taken from cultured homes bullied and frightened into going into a foreign state and were ruined and debauched by the defendants who abandoned their wives and infants to commit the crime and then after a reference to the western fuel directors case which has no insinuation or reflection in it the district attorney says before i could send my resignation i received another telegram from the department ordering me to postpone the case against certain defendants of the western fuel co and not to try them unless ordered by the department no reflection or imputation of base motives there no accusation of wrongdoing at least in bitter humiliation of spirit i am compelled to acknowledge what i have heretofore indignantly refused to believe namely that the department of lustice is yielding to influence which will cripple and destroy the usefulness of this office it must be upon this statement that the president says the district attorney accused the attorney general of wrongdoing and the attorney general says the district attorney accused him of base motives i am compelled to acknowledge what i have heretofore indignantly refused to believe namely that the department of justice is yielding to influence which will cripple and destroy the usefulness of this office he makes no accusation of wrongdoing he imputes no motives in the statement but says that he now believes the department is yielding to influence which will cripple and destroy the usefulness of his office is that true there is nothing else in the telegram of the district attorney sending his resignation making accusation of wrongdoing or imputing motives the district attorney stated certain facts he was ordered by the attorney general to postpone the cases that order now they find will destroy the usefulness of the office out there and they run to cover to change the order frightened rabbits never got away quicker than tile president and the attorney general when this matter was brought up but they might have excused themselves to the world if they had said the attorney general acted under a misapprehension a little carelessly perhaps and then withdrawn what they have done and commended the officer uder him who dared to call the attention of the public to the facts that would have been a manly course we all of course excuse mistakes and we all admire manliness but we all hate hypocrisy and this action now taken is pure hypocrisy what did the district attorney do that he is objectionable he called the attention of the president in the only way it would have received attentionthrough a resignationto the fact that the attorney generals office had been imposed upon they now admit that it was imposed upon they now vacate the proceedings which had been taken they now revoke the order of postponement they now admit that the cases demand speedy trial but unfairly unjustly and with pure hypocrisy they accuse the officer who called their attention to the circumstances and say that he is at fault manliness such as i would have expected from the christian moral gentleman occupying the white house would have required him to ask the district attorney to withdraw his resignation and try these cases he being most familiar with them they have now accepted the resignation of the district attorney and have dismissed the whiteslaveact officer who worked up the case i suspect the elder caminetti and possibly the junior caminetti may be quite willing to have the case speedily tried when the few men who were familiar with the case and who have worked it up are fired out of the service before anyone else has time to learn all the circumstances of the case but what was the excuse offered by the attorney general for his order the attorney general admits that he received a report from mr mcnab stating that there might be attempts to interfere with the due course of justice by improper influence he admits that he has such records on his files if he had admitted the truth complete he would have admitted that he had several letters as i am informed from mr mcnab to the same effect and tenor but he received a telephone message from another cabinet officer mr chaihlnan it is one of the peculiarities of service in the house of representatives that members here after a while take all public officials as somewhat in the nature of a joke and never give too serious importance to the man and his office with the possible exception which i hope is generally true that of the office of the president and the man occupying it because we all bow respectfully before the office of president and the man who occupies the place whoever he may be though usually it is better for a man occupying the place not to give out too many newspaper statements or interviews if he does not desire to be criticized but the new cabinet officers up here seem to have an exaggerated importance in their own eyes and an exaggerated idea of tile i nfluence of each and when a former member of this house a distinguished member who might telephone to 40 members of this house and then go and see them if he wanted tothey would be treated upon terms of equalitylie telephones to the attorney generals office and the attorney general says thatwithout stopping to go through the files and so refresh my recollection concerning any particular circumstances of the case i sent the following telegram to the district attorney ordering him to postpone the case what sort of a department of justice is it what ind of an attorney general is it who having on file from the district attorney statements to the effect that people were endeavoring to thwart the administration of justice and to bribe or buy tile witnesses of the government on a telephone message from so great a man as even a cabinet ollicer without investigation without reference in his department without stopping as lie says to examine the files orders the case postponed which in all probability would have meant to have the case dismissed or ended no doubt the attorney general is a great lawyer and a great man but if the democratic administration intends to proceed upon the theory that when a cabinet officer telephones the attorney general or when some wealthy defendant as happened in the western fuel case walks into the oflice of the attorney general and asks to have a case postponed it is lone there will not be many democratic administrations in the next hundred years we demand the enforcement of these laws we demand that the attorney general before he sends an order to drop or postpone a whiteslave case or other case shall stop to examine the files in his office what kind of an excuse would that be if offered by a clerk in the law office of one of the gentlemen here what kind of an excuse would it be for one of the gentlemen here practicing law to give to his client i dismissed your case i did not stop to examine the files in the office to see whether you had a good case or what the circumstances were the excuse offered is worse than the offense and offered for the purpose of casting ignominy upon one official in the department of justice who has had bravery who has had courage who has known how to do things this district attorney might have sent a letter to the attorney general as he suggests reiterating what he had already said two or three times and he would have been dismissed for refusing to obey the directions of the attorney general but mr mcnab rising superior to place looking up to more lofty heights than drawing a salary knew that the way to attract the attention of the country and to obtain c gnsideration by the administration was to do what he did flash his resignation over the wires to the president calling attention to the facts not imputing motives not accusing the office of wrongdoing but calling attention to the facts which he had already reported to the department of justice and by so doing he has made the president and the attorney general not only to beg the question

afternoon to call your attention to some of the importations during the four months following its enactmentoctober november and december of 1913 and january of 1914onethird of a year i take it that i will not underestimate the importations for the year if i assume that they will be three times as great as the amount received during those four months and upon that basis i have made some calculations to which i invite your attention now gentlemen i suppose no political party can frame a tariff bill that will be satisfactory in all particulars to all of the people of the united states or even satisfactory to all the members of the party fashioning it there are things in the recent tariff bill objectionable to me the bill was made for the entire countryfor the west and the east and the south and the north the state of minnesota differs in many respects from other states it has different interests and naturally they appeal strongly to one who comes from that state for instance during the last three years both in quantity and in value more than onehalf of all the iron ore produced and marketed in the united states came from the state of minnesota it by far outranks any other state in the production of iron ore minnesota too is a great agricultural state not so great as the greatest agricultural state of all illinois but a state that ranks high i notice that in the production of oats last year illinois stood first iowa second minnesota third in the production of wheat north dakota stood first kansas second and minnesota third in the production of barley minnesota stood first i speak of these things simply to indicate the importance that a representative from minnesota may attach to the particular things in which that state is so prominent it has been called the breadandbutte state of the union its flour fron which the bread is made is sold all over the world and its dairy butter is famous throughout the country the largest flour mill in the world is located in the metropolis of the statethe pillsbury a flour mill with a capacity of 15 000 barrels a day and actually making 11 000 barrels of flour every day onefourth of the entire flour output of the united states goes out of the city of minneapolis i spoke of its being the leading state in the production of barley the enormous amount of 49 727 130 bushels of that cereal were produced there in 1913 more than the total production of canada i said that the tariff bill was made for no particular state but for all of the states of the union of course there were a great many people who were dissatisfied with it because some privilege or some benefit or some favor that they had enjoyed under former tariff laws had been taken away some of us may have unduly exaggeratted its importance because it was a measure of our political party others were bound to find fault with it bound to quarrel with it because it was a measure of our party and not of theirs it has its enemies and while i would not charge anyone no matter how partisan he may be with desiring panics hard times and business depression in order that some political advantage may be worked out of them i can not but believe that the persistent attempts to decry the bill and to misrepresent its effects cause apprehension and distrust throughout the country and apprehension and distrust usually breed industrial stagnation and disaster out through the northwest it has been stated repeatedly that it is a bill which discriminates against the north and favors the south i take it no one really believes that the persons who made the bill attempted to favor any particuilar section of the country or attempted to injure any section of it an examination of the items of the bill gives little color for any such charge for instanceand i siall refer to this but briefly for i have other matters to discussan effort was made to put upon the free list the things entering into the production of manufactured productstheraw

brains simply because we did not have a proper currency system one that could supply currency to sound banks and through them to sound industries in such a crisis those financial institutions that the secretary of the treasury was able to reach and those that the clearing house cared for were saved many that were not assisted were ruined public opinion demands changes in the national monetary system changes broad and sound that will create a system that will carry the business of the country and prevent the recurrence of panics like that of 1907 we need a more elastic currrency but at the same time it must be guarded against inflation it seems to be generally conceded that there must be some agency controlled or at least supervised by the federal government that can increase or decrease the outstanding volume of currency as conditions in the country actually require and that the circulating medium so issued shall be secured by sound banking assets such as gold and shorttime commercial paper guaranteed by solvent banks limited of course to such percentage of commercial paper as sound judgment will justify in time of panic it is currency and credit that banks and through
