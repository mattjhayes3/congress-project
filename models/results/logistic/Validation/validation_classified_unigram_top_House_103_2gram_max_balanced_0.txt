it is really kind of reflected in this map which is shown over here he asked the question why should we take the brunt of it why does not president salinas lower the rates the tariff rates in mexico the fact of the matter is of course tariff rates have been coming down substantially from a top rate of 100 percent to a top rate now of 20 percent and from an average rate of 50 percent to an average rate of 10 percent in mexico the result of that as i am sure the gentleman from ohio must know because you could hardly escape the statistics they are so dramatic is that united states exports to mexico that is that sale of goods from the united states to mexico has increased in 1987 from 16 billion to 43 billion in 1991 that is a 180percent increase in the course of 5 years now economists may differ and you and i may differ on exactly how many jobs are created by each 1 billion of exports but i do not think there is ank disagreement that every 1 billion of additional sales to mexico or to any country creates jobs so the fact of the matter is that we have had a dramatic increase in the number of jobs created in this country as a result of the additional trade that we are doing with mexico the estimate is 400 000 that is direct jobs not indirect jobs but 400 000 jobs since 1987 have been created in this country as a result of the additional business that we are doing with mexico
