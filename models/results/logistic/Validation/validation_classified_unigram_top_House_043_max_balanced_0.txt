whole rangeof subjects relating to the expenditures of the government can be legitimately discussed and as i stand pledged then to show wasteful extravagance in expenditures i will avoid now as carefully as i can all reference to the questions as to which i then intend to be heard and confine myself to what i consider the legitimate and proper means of supplying the wants of the government and the people with such suggestions thereon as may occur to me my remarks will of couso be somewhat disconnected and i ask pardon for not having a speech prepared i think it was well for the chairman of the committee on ways and means to pursue the course hdid when he laid this little tax bill before the house it was due tot only to himself but to his committee that he should lay before the country not only the condition of the treasury bt the means by wicich our revenues were behig sqnandered i agree with muchthat lie said i think he proved reckless extravagance and wasteful if not corrupt administration of public affairs against his political associates and he certainly proved that he and others who have for years controlled legislation backed as they are and have been always by an overwhelning party majority have been either false to the great trusts contided to them or incapable of managing properly interests so vast when he had to confess before the country and the world that the whole management of public affairs is going from bad to worse year by year why arc these things so i because as the party leaders on the other side can no longer conceal and hardly deny

chnngo ill the administration of public afairs or that their materitl prosperity would be preserved antd maintained notwithstanding tall they ga w au felt of maladministratiou the party leaders were sccure but when the panic of last summer brought poverty to their doors in the midst of bountiful harvests whe tile workshops were closed and the wives and children of men ready atd willing to labor were cryiig for bread people began to look into the cauusas which produced cjainities and sufferings like these in a way they had never looked before and they began to understand that great and flagrant wrongs had been done and grievous evils heaped pon theiim by the mesi they had trusted with power the letaders of the party may welt quail they may cry aloul now for retrenchmeni and reform they cannot reform if they would and the corruptionists who control even tie party leaders would not if they could after ill the extltations and laudations which the partisan presspaid of course liberally for its flatteryhad from day to day for years poured out in praise of the nagnificeatliscal policy whereby the national debt was being reduced with such wonderful rapidity a clap of thunder from a cloudless sky culd not have startled the country more than the announcement not only that the national debt was bchlg increased but that the treasury of the united states was in imumient diauger of bankruptcy nosooner had congress con vened than the secretary of the treasury rushed to the comnittee on ways and m ans with a demand for secreased taxatiou 4 000 000 was the amouni suggested if not distinctly demanded and the fact was developed that the secretary without eonsnlting congress was rcissuing legaltender notes which by law lie had been required to retire and when retired was peremptorily orderedto caiiel the committee was thus met at the very threshold of its proceedings and deliberations with serious embarrassmen3s i may not speak fur all the members of that committee each will by speech or vote declare his purpose but for myself i determined after as full investigation as i could make that it was not necessary either to increase the burdens of the people by taxation or to create aiy more interestbearing debt and i avowed my determinatio promptly on the floor not to vote for either while that was so i did not see my way clearlyin what i greatly desired the redution of taxation except in such cases as by the rmoval of protection the revenuewouldccrtainly beincreased byreduetion that did not apply to internalrovenue taxation so that i was forced to report against the removal of the taxes on matches and bankcheck stamps much as i desired the removal of them because i could not see how 95 100 000 the amount which would be lost to the treasury could be supplied by any act congress would be likely to pass and i was not prepared to say that it was safe to reduce the revenue even to that extent in that form unless it was otherwise supplied a careful examination into the condition of the finances developed to my mind that time secretary hald lost his head he had not rallied from the panic of last september he had been demoralized by the failure of what he thought were mighty efforts to restore confidence his grand scheme to return to specie paymetsnts by the distribution of a few bags of silver was a miserable and discreditable abortion while the 14 000 000 he thing into the maelstrom of wall street in septcember to stop the paiie was like pouring water from a cup to produce a flood in the missisxippi frightened by his failares his last resource was to cling with a misers grip to the gold he had in the treasury and in order to save it he reissued as his necessities required it 25 00d 000 of the 441000 000 of legaltender notes which had been retired and had been canceled by the act of april 12 1s66 he facetiously calls it a reserveas if any congress or any set of men fit to be out side the bounds of a lunatic asylum would trust any secretary of the treasury with despotic power over 44 000 000 of the currency of the country as a reserve to be used or not as be saw fit i was in congress in febrimary 1863 when the law prohibiting further cotrabtion was passed and 356 000 000 were thereby fixed as the volume of legalsenders sowre rmany of you the rclations of president johnson and his cabinet to congressat that time were anything bit confidential articles of impeachment were being nrged against the president his cabintat least his secretary of the treasurywas his friend will any man pretend that congress intended in the then condition of things to give the president or his secretary power to contract or expanl the currency to the extent of 44 000 000 theletter ot the law negatives such

beneficent exercise of the power cooutlded to government to protect sai foster every legitimate scheme of popular education but the grave question is presented of tic power of the federal covernment

the ruins of free government the unification of the nation one by one the safeguards of republican liberty perpetuated by our federal system have vanished the war power of the governmment was claimed as the warrant for the gross usurpations which have made the executive arm strong enough to set aside the will of the people and make a state subservient to the illegitimate aithoriry of a governor

yielded to the remorseless demand of centralization snd despotism i am led to these remarks at this time when appropriations are sought to perpetuate this bureau because i desire to reprobate and condemn the policy which seeks to accomplish by acdirect means the centralization aud consolidation at the capital of all authority over the first and strongest incentive to liberty the right of the citizen to free education the precedents of the past history if our government do not binsd the republican party and through its avowed leaders it claims the right and assumes that the power of the general govermnent is ample to say how thepeople of a state shall be educated no such authority was ever chdmed bythe fathers among the constitutional grants to the federal government no authority was given to establish a bureau or department to manipulate the institutions of learning and concentrate the authority to educate the people in the agents of the federal power in the great

whatever the ef0ct of other measures which have been introduced into congress looking to the control of the railroads commerce the telegraph and savingsbanks and to what greater or less extent the governmental control of those vast interests would enlargo its funcrions and be daugerous to the reserved powers of the states there can be no pretense or object in centralizing the authority to

publio mind has overwhelmingly tended to the assertion of theories of government that were contrary to all my convictions of right a terrible civil war had swung the country from its old moorings and left a its legacies a long train of evils detrimentally affecting the morals of the people and the policies of the country while passion was triumphant the tongue of a prophet would have had no power the conviction that their passions had cooled that they now realize existing wrongs and that they are willing candidly and without prejudice to consider the state of the country is explanation of my departure from a past line of action it will be my effort to prove that the present chaotic condition of our business interests and the unsettled and dangerous situation of many of the states is attributable to nwise legislation looking to the overthrow of the power of the people and the assumption of their rightful authority by the central government that the policies of the republican party proceed upon false theory which instead of leaving the people free to as great an extent as is consistent with public safety have resulted in aggressive restraints upon them antagonistic to republican institutions and violative of all the fundamental maxims of free government the lethargic state of the public mind superinduced by false assumptions of authority by those in power has enabled monopoly built by class legislation dictated by the enemies of the people to take control of their affairs and their substance is being absorbed and their liberty imperilled the most common but at the same time one of the most profound maxims is that necessity is the creator of development to make a people great we must impose responsibilities on them must bring the aggregate human mind upon the theater of thought must make it their interest to carefully deliberate upon the public welfare every law that nuiiecessarily relieves them of responsibilify is a law against freedom and intellectual progress a people little governed are greatly blessed the teaching of the republican party is that thi central government shall think for the people every energy of my life has been devoted to the assertion and vindication of the great troth that the people to be free must think for themselves the father who assunes control of the mental movements of his child and by superior experience and mistaken affection destroys his selfreliance ruins his child a government that relieves the people from thought is an enemy to intellectual progress and the ally of despotism the law of competition in thought is the foundation upon hich progress and freedom rest class legislation clothes its beneficiaries with the instrumentaities of power facilitates combinations of capital erects monopolies and is the cornerstone of despotism and its creature protection whether exhibiting itself in paternalism in government or the erection of classes is the delusive snare that is held out to entrap the people one of the maxims of bismarck is that those who hold the moneybags are the masters of the people the protective legislation of republican rule has forced the moneybags to the control of the hanker who by education and interest is the enemy of labor it is my purpose in as fair and impartial a manner as history will justify to present the record of the republican party since the conclusion of the war and to the extent of my humble ability point out its errors and indicate remedies in the hour of conflict public servants may be excused for departure from law and principle for that reason a generous judgment would not hold them responsible for their action during its existence but when it has passed away the highest duty of those in authority is to allay the passions it begot and conduct the people into the pathways of peace and security has the republican party who have had unrestrained control of the nation since its conclusion been governed by this simple inflexible rile of public conduct is it not true that a policy of hate and proscription in every recurring political contest is promulgated by their leadeis to excite the passions of the people and divert the public mind from the encroachments of the money and political despotisms during the war the people of the northwest the section i have the honor to represent were educated by the morbid demand for their products the wax created and its attendant prosperity to believe that republican administration would nake that prosperity permanent what is now the condition of the northwest an inquiring man entering one of its rich regions desiring to know time condition of a people so bountifully blessed by providence would ask what is the debt private and ptblic andwho constructed and own the vast systems of rail that cross the country at every point he would beanswered that the private debt all created since the war was immense that it was represented by loans made by capitalists of protected districts that it was secuied by mortgages oii the homes of the people and that the crop of mortgages were rapidly encroaching on the bounty the fields awarded to the constant toil of the laboring and agricultural class that the railways were built hugely by subsidies donated by the people that burdensome indebtedness had been assumed by the counties for their construction and by some nysterious process the bonds of the counties had drifted to the possession of the capitalists of protected districts at the conclusion of the war the people of tile northwest were out of debt after ten years of republican administration in peace that people occupying gods richest heritage are impoverished their energies crippled and their property depreciated in value further investigation shows that the control and ownership of the vast system of rail of the northwest was in capitalists of protected districts in distant states that they were by them consolidated and centralized the time was when western lines of railway were independent were instrumental in competition between the lines for the markets and secured living rates to the people for their labor but consolidation being accomplished competition is crushed and the roads instead of responding to and sympathizing with the prosperity of the west answer the greedy demands of capital centralized and produced for classes in distant states by protection it may be said that the publication of the truth tenls to sectionalize the country that its utterance is unpatriotic how much more unpatriotic are those who use all the instrumentalities that party or money can afford to fasten a system on the country that robs those upon whom its prosperity depends to fatten the stockjobbers and gamhlers and to deposit power over the whole producing and labormg classes in numberless diverse petty and soulless despotisms the consolidation of our railroads could not have been accomplished in so short a peritd without the rapid production and centralization of money protection is the author of both evils the redundancy of money produced by it for a class in a section sought avenues of investment and stocks being the most available the different lines of railroad were swallowed up by that class mid consolidation followed let it not be charged that i am actuated by hostility to any section the agricnlturists and the laborers of the sections in which these beneficiaries of the government reside representing as they do a large preponderance of the population are as much the victims of the system as the people of the same class in other sections investigation will demonstrate that theproducing and laboring interests in those localities are in no more flourishing condition than in the past and that the centralization of money in the few has erected class distinctions founded upon wealth built by the toil of the people proscriptive and degrading in their character and unrepublican in their spirit that protection is as well the enemy of the people in the protected districts as elsewhere my hostility proceeds not against a section bat a class not against the people but against their legalized robbers one of the results of the unbridled control of this class is the continued oppression of the people of the lately rebellious states they realize that so long as they can by force artifice or fraud prevent an expression of the intelligence of those states so long as those states are represented by adventurers having no interest in their prosperity just so long can they perpetuate wrong against the whole people the rebellion was bred by a wrong that was created and legalized by the nation slavery consolidated the hostile action of the people of the south for the perpetuation of slavery and through the passions its assuned interest and menaced authority developed the south was precipitated into war against the government the present is no appropriate time to discuss the rights or the wrongs of those engaged in the conflict happily for humanity its deadly recitals belong to the past deeds of heroism equaling if not surpassing any written or unwritten were daily occurrences in both the hostile camps those who measure a people by their martial spirit or tme skill of their commanders will on either side find that high courage and genius they admire i confess i have no admiration for war that it is my pride and i believe my highest duty here and everywhere to use every endeavor to avert it the war having passed away and the people being again reunited in a common interest my effort in the past has been and in the future will be to still the unholy passions it begot the south and the northwest are allies by every physical financial and political interest before the war unimpeded natural laws had established reciprocal relations which protected and enriched ehch of the sections the producer of cotton and tobacco was the consumer and competitor with the world for the products of the i northwest but the war with all its attendant horrors was less destructive of the moral and material welfare of the whole country than subsequent administration of southern affairs it will be my attempt to demonstrate that the passions that have been brought into play since the conclusion of the war have been used by the despotic interests that now have the people under their feet as one of the instrumentalities for the perpetuation of their power they shrewdly calculated that it could only be secured by dividing those who ought to be friends by warring on that reciprocity that the almighty by natural law has made eternal they realized that the genius and nobility of a people were never crushed by hostile conflict in the open field that the slow processes of a degrading despotism established over a prostrate people were the instruments to crush their souls and destroy their patriotism and rising energy the generosity that soldiers proclaimed at the conclusion of the war was unsuited to the mad passions of the home patriots the unholy ambition of political adventurers and to the deadly avarice of the moneychanger who hoped to fatten through the continued misery of the people of the rebellious states adventurers flocked to the south who instead of attempting to accommodate society and labor to the new order of things instead of encouraging the people to a combined effort to resurrect their country from the ruin of the conflict instead of attempting to inaugurate a feeling of confidence between the lately freed black population and the white people of the south exhausted every artifice to divide them professing friendship for the black they plundered their states and robbed their people it is a grateful task to testify to exceptions many went south seeking homes and inspired by an honest desire to aid its people eminent among that class i may be allowed to refer to governor walker the old state of virginia has been blessed by wise and patriotic administration her credit has been preserved and ber treasury protected elected a jeffersonian republican he could only preserve her people from the rapacity of plunderers by offering defiance to the mandates of the spurions republicanism of thepresent undergreat difficulties he foughtanoblie and suceessfflfight and hasadded another brilliant page to the history of the old dominion and has won the admiration of his countrymen but the general policy of the past ten years has been through carpetbag rule directed to the protection of one raceto the effort to change every moral social philosophical christian and political principle thereby subjecting the superior to the control of the inferior race let us test the wisdom of the system by a trite question what man is there if he had business to transact of a private character in any one of the states beleaguered by carpetbaggism who would submit its control to the negro if not why wiling that the highest considerations affecting the present as well as future generations should by the exercise of national influence be deposited with him the answer of republicans may be that they have no faith in the white people of the south have not these people signalized their greatness in the past in the field the forum and the closet their ancestry largely contributed in the creation and protection of those manifold blessings that embellished our country until factions took the place of parties and passion instead of reason assumed the empire of the public mind do you not realize that there must be harmony in the south between the races before prosperity can be assured and does notthe nation suffer when any of its sections are impoverished the white people of the south are without arms without money and without organization they have in their midst a large population of a different race with equal political privileges all believed to be loyal by the most fanatical is it not true that rebellion against constituted authority is not only impracticable but impossible let me further test the wisdom of the system will it be denied that the debts of those states without corresponding benefits have been increased near 100 000 000 that their people black and white are manacled by them not only for the present but for future generations that fleeing governors and plundered states are the visible evidence of its operations will it be denied that if after the war the people had been remitted to the control of those states that if the beneficent influence of our institutions had free from national interpositios been allowed to take their natural course the scoundrels who robbed their treasuries and divided and corrupted their people would have been purged from their bosom i have been too long in public life not to be aware that the enuneiation of the truth in regard to the administration of southern affairs will be a pretext for numberless calumnies that all the machinery that hate supported by the power of the monopolists will be put in ifotion for the destruction of any man who has the boldness to avow it that the war with all its attendant horrors will be vividly portrayed and elaborated by the moneygluttons and the political and religious pharisees that have cursed the south and through that the country for the last eight years i believe however that the time has now arrived when the suffering that the general system of public administration has entailed will justify a full exposition of its ruinous tendencies the people have awakened to the reality that there is an invisible dagger being plunged into their vitals that the rising energy and patriotism of the south is crushed under the heel of faction sustained by the power of the government that the prosperity of the south and the nation axe relative and that both are victims that their energies and their labor their products and their natural resoures are bound in the manacles of political and money centralization erected into a despotic colossus by the insidious but iron grasp of protection tie career of protection in its political and financial aspects carries with it the most valuable instruction to mankind its mission has been to perpetuate fraud encourage ignorance and establish despotism its history is written in the galling despotism it erected over the french relieving the nobility and the priesteraft from the burdens of government until the smothered discontent of the people resulting from ages of oppression volcanolike burst its chains and appalled the world by its violence in the grasping avarice and inhuman control of england over hereast iudiacolonies enslaving a large portion of the human race without pretext toseerothe perpetuation of her protected kings and nobility impoverishing a people who were rich reducing to misery those who had been happy while export duties from and import ditties to her colonies filled the coffers of her country is written in the history of the last ten years in this country by the overflowing treasuries of the protected elass and by the poverty of the agriculturist and laborer by the tendency of the times to the establishment of monopolies and the destruction of private enterprise by the erection of colossal fortunes in the few and the impoverishment of the many in till its career in every department crime stalks ia its companionship and injustice and fraud are its results the next subject to which i desire to direct the attonion of the house is the management of our financial affairs the authors of the policy of exemption of the public debt from taxation claim that it was necessary to float the securities and provide the means to carry on the war certainly nothing but the most vital necessity could ever have justified it the manifold evils that have flowed from this legislative protection of capital should forever admonish mankind that war however successful in its element of force is always dangerous to the liberties of a people the tendency of such a debt is to draw capital from its legitimate fields retard the development of all the material interests to raise the value of money cheapen labor and destroy the power of the people centralize capital make it dangerously remunerative establish classes and overthrow liberty these are the general tendencies that have resulted from the exemption of the public debt from taxation let us for a short time consider in detail its practical operations upon the people and our system of government assuming that it is conceded that competition lies at the foundation of material development it centralizes two thousand millions of capital exempted from all public burdens and diverts it from all the channels of public usefulness compels the people from their hard earnings to pay a higher rate of interest to its holders than is paid by any civilized or respectable nation on earth it was wrung from those in authority by the shylocks when thcgovernment was in extremity the national banking system a creature organized for the protection and centralization of capital the security for the issue of which are these ekempted bonds another creature for the centralization and protection of capital was summoned from the public portfolios as a panacea for all our financial evils a calm exposure of the practical workings of which in my judgment exhibits it asa plan for universal robbery by the money power centralized by republican legislation it submits the control of the finances to the bankers whose education and whose interest it is to make money high and labor cheap it centralizes three hundred and fifty millions of our circulating medium withdraws it by legislative protection from legitimate competition with the remainder of the circulation drives from the field all competition by private enterprise in the sale of money to the people absorbs not only the cash but all the credit business involving an amount many times greater than the business accomplished by the circulation forces near half the reserves by the operation of the laws controlling its organization to the money centers by authorizing certificates of redemption banks to be held by the country banks as reserves thus presenting to the banks represcrting the agricultural districts the necessity of sending their money to the centerto o make it profitable the result of which is to make money redundant in the centers and deplete all the localities from which our wealth is derived forces the money thus sent not demanded by legitimate business interests into stock gambling creates watered stocks on railroads to pay the interest on which higher rates of transportation are charged against the people develops what are known as corners against pork corni wheat and every other product by locking up the money and making them cheap when the producer holds them and after their purchase locks them up against the consumer and thereby exacts an additional and exorbitant toll against the halfstarving and poorly paid laboring population brings the people engaged in the production of wealth in competition with reckless gamblers on wall street for the use of money raises the rates of interest against all the va1lable classes by creating fancy stocks and fancy corners competitor for the consumption of the circulation and finally after withdrawing according to the report of the comptroller of th he c e fro gte contdry districts 113 000 000 of the money of the people into this shameless conspiracy against their welfare this republican financial bubble bursts and leaves the people orsaa te aiyc t to the innocent amusement of holding their empty moneybags and the redemption banksthe pets of tiss pet socalled republican system of financeto which morally the faith of the government is pledged by republican legislation refuse the payment of the pittance deposited for safekeeping by the laborer a paternal government in their fatherly kindness have centralized all the circulation and all the credits of finance in the moneydealers have destroyed by their legislation every vestige of competition in the sale of moneyto the people have kindly given the moneydealers first 6 per cent in gold payable semiannually of the money wrunig by taxation from the blood and sweat of the producers of wealth and given to the moneydealer 90 per cent of 395 000 000 of nationalbank notes without interest which the moncydealer loans to the people at the rates governing in the locality in which the bank is situated have independent of any explainable necessity established a combination of middlemn authorized by national paternal republican legislation to receive as a bounty for their robbery of the producer and the degradation of the laborer the annual stipend out of their hard earnings of 23 700 000 in gold payable semiannually the national batks centralize money the centralization of money if it does not result from the demands of legitimate business creates wild speculation wili speculation creates stockgambling stockgambling produces watered stocks and watered stocks in railroads eanding their interest call on the firmer mechanic merchant and laborer to pay his proportion to maintain a policy of paternal protection boards of brokers are established in the city of new york whose bnsines4 it is to sell and buy government securities as well as fancy stocks on margins and these securities exempted from taxation are used by the bankers to withdraw a large portion of the other personal wealth from state county and municipal taxation a few days before assessment the holders of money in banks and otherwise telegraph to their brokers in new york to purchase for them governmot bonds to an amount nearly equal to all their capital and when the assessor comes they return him about onetwoitieth of their real capital for taxation and the other nineteentwentieths in government securities by this scheme of finance fostered and practiced by the national banks full onehalf of all the other personal property in credits and circulation is drawn from local support and the farnmer the merchant the mechanic and the laborer are required to make lip this dishonest subtraction of values from time assessor by the additional tolls that are imposed on their goods lands and stock the honorable senator from the state of indiana ill the course of remarks lately made by him i suppose sounded the battlecry of his followers he says the facilities and bonefits of ihe national banking system should be orented to all the states alik thus relieving it of its present sectional character and that the restriction umon the ataount of mtionalbank circulation should be removed to relieve it of its monopoly feature and afterward in explanation of what he deemed its objectionable feature says i am a frienl of ti national banking system believing it the best the countrylhas ever had and wish to relieve it of a bleniish which is fast making it unpopular and if sont inued will make it odious this is its monopoly feature and those who seek to preserve this feature are the worst tnemics of the system even if the national bankiag facilities hal been divided anmeg the states according to thoprovisions of the aw it would be a monopoly but when the law was violated annl a few states seized upon time greater part almost to the exclusion and to the great detriment of others there is added to themonopoly an injustice which it is the part of wisdom in the friends of ihe bmiks to abolish as soon as possibl he lays down tle proposition in substance that its only defect results from the restriction upon its general adoption and assumes that when that is abolished the elasticity in currency which he so much admires will be accomplished let us for a limited period investigate the results of this scheme i undertake to say that its only object is to force the greenback which costs tie people nothing out of circulation substitute nationalbank issue therefor and perpetuate the authority of bankers sustained by legislative sympathy and legislative bounties that it is a scheme of the moneyholder to further monopolize control over the capital and credit of the country and further dominate the laboring agricultural mercantile mind mechanical classes that its result will be to force our people first to pay off a noninterestbearing obligation if the elastic fiancimal currency policy umeans anything it means that in times of scarcity it will increase iia times of redundancy contract is there any man wild enough to suppose that after banks are establislied under the national banking law with the general privilege projected by the senators plan that the national banker to accoimnodate public necessity will in the case of redundant circulation patriotically close the doors of his bank and quit business 7 is it not apparent that this scheme means that on each recurring redmimdant period the government will retire and pay off greenbacks nmd that oi each recurring period of scarcity more patriotic bankers will be called to the front to meet public exigencies and that tle whle scheme when utripped of the mysteries in which its authors enaelop it is to compel the people to pay first ai non interestbeariigdebt and relieve capital of the competition that its circulation affords the national bankers taking advantage of the distress among the people created by their own manipulations are attempting to further centralize the circulation and the credits to so manacleall the industries and control labor that all effort to throw off its fatal embrace will be futile and ineffectual assuming that there can be no question that it would force greenbacks out of circulation what is its direct result upon the people if the governmen retires interestbearing bonds the people are saved the interest there are four hundred millions of greenbacks costing nothing if an additional four hundred millions was issued and devoted to the purchase of bonds now deposited for the security of bank circulation it would save the people twentyfour millions annually the senator has rather a narrow view of the term monopoly if a system of national legislation that gives 6 per cent interest in gold paid by the people on f394 000 000 and 90 per cent of that amount of a circulation without interest and only subjected to a tax of 1 per cent on the circulation is not a monopoly in its broadest and most dangerous sense i fail to understand its meaning the project of the senator if carried out increases it to eight hundred millions in a short time forces the people to first pay off a noninterestpaying debt when interestpaying debt is existing destroys all competition in the circulation and places the whole finances of the country in the hands of middlemci pensioned if free banking is established out of the sweat and labor of the people to near fifty millions of gold annually if an inquisition of lunacy were summoned to determine the state of a mans mind who when it was optional with him to postpone the payment of 10 000 either by the execution of evidences of indebtedness bearing 6 per cent in gold interest payable semiannnally or the execution of evidences of indebtedness without interest and that man should select the interestpaying security ts the most expedient to promote his financial welfare are there twelve men on this broad earth who would not decide him a man of unsound mind and appoint a conservator the senator manoging the business of the people proposes to pay off first the noninterestpaying debt the senator further says bfut i dispute the proposition that the measure of the depreciation of currency is the measure of its redundancy the depreciation dots not depend open that caunoe but chiefly upon the fact that it cannot be used in the payment of the public debt principal or interest or in payment of duties i suppose it cannot be denied successfully that the measure of depreciation of currency is the measure of its redundancy when natural laws are left free to control it but as the senator says it canoot be used in payment of the public debt why is this f there are twelve hundred millions of the fivetwenty bonds now in existence which are by their terms payable at the option of the government and until republican legislation otherwise construed their meaning it was understood by the people that the principal was payable in legaltenders this legislation upon the basis of the present premium creacs against the people an additional debt of over 150 000 000 but there are other artificial causes to which he fails to allude the national banking laws drive over folty millions of the reserves to the redemption cities by providing that certificates of redemption banks eanbe held to represent threefifths of the reserves of the country banks and certificates of the new york banks can be held to represent onehalf of the reserves in the other redemption cities it is centralized by operation of law it can be put to no use cannot be made available elsewhere not being called on by any legitimate demand of trade it has sought stockgambling and is the creator of the wild speculation and recurring disasters that annually threaten our people and destroy our valses the comptroller of the currency reports that at the commencemet of the crisis the high rates that stockgamubling had created for money had drawn over sixty millions into the hands of the brokera from the country to the city of new york alone over forty millions more was in the other redemption cities the most of which was beyond question absorbed by the same unhealthy influence stockgambling depends for existence on the distinction between gold and currency it enables rings and combinations to inflate or contract values at will the national banking system by creating stockgambling is the causo of the depreciation of our currency n signal proof of which is that when the national banks were broke and the stock boards closed it appreciated to 6j per cent discount and when the banks resumed and the stock boards opened it gradually assumed its old standard of depreciation the national banling system throws over one hundred millions of the money of the country districts to the stock board the combined power of the whole of which was and is now used to perpetuate the distinction between gold and currency i voted but a few days since authorizing the secretary of the treasury to pay out what are falsely called reserves 26 000 000 of which he paid without authority for numerous reasons one was that it did not result in adding additional annual burdens upon a people already sorely oppressed by protective legislation another that it to some extent robbed the advocates of national banks of a pretext for accomplishing their expansion another that it would save the people from the imposition of additional demands resulting from the extortion of the national banks another that it cripples the policy of the money centralizers and threatens the lines of the advancing money despotism were it not that stock gambling created by the national banks and the national bankers policy of reserves falsely held out to the people as a sure protection of depositors absorbed near two hundred millions of the circulation and withdrew it from all useful pursuits into channels destructive of every legitimate interest my belief is that the currency would be amply sufficient for all the demnds of trade but so long as national bankers control the circulation aid credits of the country it makes but little difference what the volue of circulation is it will be drawn into the gambling vortex rates of interest will be high and all useful development retarded the senator refers to the fact that our huports are vastly in excess of our exports and in the course of his speech says we have told the people of the south for years that they teust accept the situalien let us try to practice what we preach we too must aceept the situatioa did the senator consider that it might be thought that the severest trials the people of the south as well as all the other agricultural districts have had to contend with results from protective legislation since the war that the effort to raise the laboring class of the south that has embellished repnblican legislation since the war that resolving all that class instantly from the condition of laborers into statesmauship that the translation of a whole race from cotton producers to legislators and the subordination of the experienced and the intelligentin connection with the beauties of carpetbag administration that their protective legislalon begot to which was soperadded the beneficent influence of national bankers administration of financial affairshad anything to do with the condition of our export trade is it not true that the chief southern products are always valuable for export is it not true that carpetbag administration robbed tile southern people of one hundred millions and so mortgaged their energies and absorbed their capital that they are this day poorer than they were when peace was proclaimed at appomattox y is it not true that national banks are charging them from 15 to 25 percent per annum for the use of the nationalbank circulation that a kind republican administration gives those bankers for nothing is it not true that near ten years have elapsed since the conclusion of the war with un bridled control assumed by the republican party that a large nunber of those states are in such unsettled condition politically that it is thought wise to introducethe beneficent influence of the bayonet to maintain the authority of the carpetbagger and is it not further true that development of vast resources of export wealth has been retarded that the investment of capital has been prevented by the madness and fanaticism aid the selfish ambition that have sustained such a policy against a brave and a generous people is it not true that their lands are worth less and that their values have been decreasing ever since the conclusion of the war yoor policy has sartially destroyed the resources of the south has largely contribute to the excess of imports over exports for the reason that instead of encouraging the production of the great export staple of the south it has robbed the producer instead of reconciling all classes to the new order of things it has divided those who to promote the general welfare should cooperate has made an uneducated class represented by reckless adventurers thie rulers and attempted to reduce tie organized intelligence of the south to serfdom in the pretended interest of the colored race but in the real interest of centralization and despotism each session gives birth to projects to harass the southern people mir speaker before the accession of the republican party our people elected public servants who understood that encouragemcnt of immigration was one of their highest duties that the public wealth was increased by it that it would result in more rapid development of our great resources what has been the policy of the republican party in regard to the foreigner the martin koszta ease under mr marcys administration of the state department had settled the principle that after declaration of intention to become a citizen of the united states the foreigner was entitled to the protection of the flag i have lately had shown me the instructions of the state departwent under the republican administration of mr fish in which it is declared that no foreigner is entitled to a passport tmtil he becomes naturalized this decision i suppose was made upon the demand of the crowned heads of europe and the result is that republican rule denationalizes every man of foreign birth until he becomes a citizen tie senator would do well to inform the german and the irish and till other nationalities who desire to share our heritage that they too must accept the situation it appears to me that a rightful inscription on their banners would be protection of capital it iatnifectures and money protection to the colored american citizen of african descent and war on all the balance of peoples industries and interests having made a hasty investigation of the policies of the republican party it will now be my effort to exhibit the remedy for their defects the letter of the federal constitution and the theory of our government is that all officers of the national and state governments are the servants of the people how far the theory atd the law have been departed from it has been my effort to show every right or responsibility not delegated by the constitutioun is expressly reserved to the people and the states and every eteroachimnt on that principle is an aggression upon the people atd war on our institutions the whole theory of the government rests on the proposition that the people are capable and have the right to govern themselves assumption of paternalism in finance relieving the people from responsibility is dangerous in a twofold aspect first it tends to overthrow free institutions second it relieves the people from responsibility atd it so doing proportionately disqualifies them for control the edicts of necessity are the authors of progress and the handmaidens of mental development to make a people capable of governing you ittitot impose tile responsibility of governnmnt on them one of th profoundest errors that marks the course of repiblica party adiiistratio is that it is necessary to make laws establshinig banks and thereby cotsoidating the money interest money independent of all laiws for its organization has inherent power of combination that is dangerous to the public welfare the reason of this is obvious it is the representative of value merely by its constitution it antagonizes is at war with labor which is the real foundation upon which all values rest its constant effort is to override and subject labor to its control every written law establishing money combiiations adds to the inherent tendency it possesses to dominate the people the war between capital and labor is a conconitant of all organized societies aned when capital gets rite control flesh blood and brains are the victims the most important of the many necessary refoins therefore is the total abolition of the socalled national banking system it has none ofthe qualities of a pine and unselfish nationality it is the organization of iniddleien who represent ani infinitesmna fraction of ourpopulation who through wealth which in the main has been accumulated by protective legislation not subject to the control of the people are made the rocipieots of bounty extorted from their earnings all laws that look to and encourage combinations of capital are laws in the interest of despotic control every expedient for its diffusion is in the interest of fimucial stability results ill a more tqual distribution of our resources more equally and more justly divides it among the people and is a ladmtark of prosperity and liberty by the abolition of the national banks and the purchase of the flivetwenty securities to an aniutequal to the nationalank issue with greenbacks the people will be saved 6 per cenct in gold annually oil the amount of bonds deposited for security of their issue resulting iui the saving of the sum of twentyodd million dollars gold each year the money issued will go into the shands ef the people they will beremitted to the power that of right belongs to themto select their own fiinanciers in doing which the mst couservtstivo ecocomical and upright wili be made their depositories tme result of which will be that all tle accumulated surplus will be devoted to legitimate pursuits and the healthy developimment of the locality in which it is produrcel ont of the glaring faults of national banking to which i have not before adverted is the absence of individual accountability to the people the officers of the bank are the clerks of the directors and te directors are the appointees of the stockholders and when it the late crisis the banks broke there was no one depositors could hold personally responsible no such system without the indorsencut of tie government could ever have secdred tie confidence of tile people the people having too much faith its paternal control abandoned the inquiry that belongs to their character when responsibility is imposed on them if they expect to preserve intact their liberties they must assucne and demand control of their material interests party spirit forgetting the ge mrc welfare in devotion to men or factions is one of the producing causes of that confidence in central infallibility that endangers the authority and tile liberty of the peoile the passions begotten by civil war are the most potent istrumentalities of bad men to breed those party hates and persdual attachaseuts and resentments that mislead the people and induce them to surrender their rightful authority the greatest misfortute tut etn befall a free leopile is to submit their reason to the control of passion the despotic

cotssistent with safe organization to submit everything to their control burke a very great mail in the zenith of his intelligence proclaimed a great truth when lie said the treasury was the state i propose to intrust the control of the money to the people they will select in their neighborhoods and their counties the wisest most conservative and most responsible of their citizens for agents in its management economy and reform legitimate business and stablo values will follow the instrumentalities thati are now brought into play to create stock gambling and all the direful influences that follow it will be swept out of existence the man selected with wisdom by the people and responsible to them for the safe control of capital will embark the money only iii ligiti isiate pursuits insteadof being an organization for the centralizatio of money each agent so selected will be watchful of the conditioi of other agents and those in control instead of organizin raids oms the producer will be guardians for the people of financial security and the credit and cash business of the people will be establisbcd on a sale permanent and free basis the greenbacks issued from the treasury will pay off a debt now annually costing the people over twenty millions in gold will go to them independent of any central authority diffusion of capital will take the place of contralization of capital the monopolies will be dethroned and tile people will be reinstated jackson whose genius foreshadowed the ruin that would follow the centralized power of money appealed to the people against its encroachments and fought a gallant and successful battle the people are rising in their might to burst its shackles many of their friends may fall by the wayside but they will win the victory and once more and i hope permanently we will commence our career in the interest of freedom an overruling providence has marked this country as the theater on which man dud shall demonstrate their equality of rights and their power of selfgovernment another remedy demanded byevery consideration of justice against class distinctions and therefore in the interest of and for the protection of liberty is that such change be made in the federal constitution that values instead of representation be tite basis of taxation the legislation of the republican party has imposed internal tax directly or indirectly rcsultiug in the absorption of the earnings of labor for illustration let us take two articles tobacco and whisky the tax and licenses imposed on the raw material leaftobacco drives the producer from the market in the sale of leaftobacco by retail and compels him to sell to capital consolidated in tobacco manufactories submits the value of the product and therefore the value of the labor engaged in it to their control has decreasedthe volume of its production by the imposition of so heavy a tax that it drives our producers out of the fields of competition in sale abroad the imposition of tax on whisky is a tax on corn and directly and indirectly subtracts from the value of labor directly and indirectly decreases the value and general usefulness of the unparalleled expanse of fertile fields that are the peoples inheritance the measure of the material condition of a people is the relation of their export and import trade if the import trade exceeds the export trade the people are becoming impoverished if the reverse is the rule the exports exceed the imports they are becoming rich under republican administration our imports have largely exceeded our exports that is although our producing capacity has been increased by an addition of over four millions of population during their retention of power the whole people are poorer than they were when these selfanointe t apostles of equality took possession of the government by the imposition of tax on tobacco and tax on whisky every dollar of which is wrung from the producer of tobacco and corn they not only impose unequfnl tax to defray the public expenditures but they prevent legitimate demand for the surplus and discourage their production in respect to the two urticles named the people are unequally taxed by what may appropriately be termed the moral dodge of the financiers in power no man more deeply deplores the frailty that results in excessive use of liquor but the way to prevent it is by appealing to the sense the pride the moral characteristics of its victims laws regulating its sale as a beverage are doubtless to sotne extent reformatory but it is demanded in the useful pursuits and will aways be manufactured and consumed tho cheaper it can be manufactured the cheaper the articles of which it is a constituent can be sold to the people the greater time number of consumers our cornraisers can reach the more valuable their products and the greater the value of their lands i hold it to be true that for the good of all classes property ought to defray public expenditure i will go further and say that ill all wellorganized societies it will pay them what is the relation of capital in lands stocks or any of its multifarious represeutatives to labor what value would capital in the hands of the rich possess if labor did not develop its fruitfulness the holders of capital are the dependents of labor by the legislation of the republican party the landholder and the mechanic the merchant and the professions and the laborer are the only classes who contribute to the maintenance of the government while the protected manufacturer and the money and bondholder are not only exempted from the burdens of government but are made the recipients of exorbitant tributes from their rightful gains the effort of the republican party and the result of protection are that the whole burden of government is collected without regard to property all their legislation looks to imposition of taxes upon the people a man may be worth 100 000 iln property without an individual dependent on him his neighbor having a large family dependent on his daily labor for the necessaries of life cousunption of supilies being the measure of revetne recovery the poor man pays more for public support than the rich one lie pays it in the shoes and the calicoes the cotton and woolen goods in the stoves and the kitchen utensils he pays it out of his hard earnings whenever li purchases an article any of whose constituents are the subjects of protection time revenes necessary to defray the expenses of our state governments are collected oe prolterty suppose time revenue system of the government under republican legislation should be attempted in the states is there a state in the union the peoplo of which would not rebel against it let me take the state of illinois for example if the people there could have tile practical realization of the systemif the poor man with ten children realizing that the revetues were measured by the consumption of necessaries and not by tie value tf property and that he in maintaining his family was compelled to pay more than his millionaire neighbor whose property was protected by the lawshow long would that people of which the poor man is the representative stand the oppression which the system begets they would not nor either ought they to tolerate it protection is the expedient that capital uses to relieve property from taxation and imposes the burdenson the masses who are poor by compelling them to pay the public revenues to secure the necessaries of life for their families and themselves assuming it to be true that land would not be valuable without its development and its development would not be possible without labor the value of land must proceed from labor the same rule is applicable to all tle constituents of wealth labor being the foundatiot of wealth the hardships you impose and the extortions you exact are directly or indirectly subtracted from the wealth of the people and from the avalue of the representatives of wealth the protective legislation of the republican party makes not only the landholder merchant mechanic and professional man pay iore for the necessities that civilization demands than free trade with direct taxation exacts but in proportion to consumption its influence reaches tle laborer and makes higher wages necessary to maintain life although rates may be higher the compensation is not adequate to their wants for the reason that time values of their products are decreased their employers and themselves being compelled to pay out of their rightful gains the extortions of class legislation and the additional burden imposed by the withdrawal of mtold millions of money anti bouds from public support the farmers many of whom have itt the past been the most determied enemies of direct taxation are by the manipulations of rings organized and made effective by republican legislation and the laborer the merchant and the meclnic who are their allies are compelled to pay off tle revenues from payment of which centralized capital it protected banks manmifactories and railroads claim vested rights by virtue of legislative exemption and legislative protection the first decree of free trade and direct taxation the constitution being so changed as to make values instead of representation tle basis would be the abolition of the civilservice system and the cnstomhouses aud by their abolition the coutless offlceholder who are the minions of poweran army in the interest of established anthoritywould be swept from existence and the states through their local officers would collect tie national revenues all history teaches us that the more distatt and the less responsible public servants are to tle people tlte more corrupt and more despotic becomes the administration of public affairs utder the itlinonce of direct taxation and free trade thelocal collectors under the immediate eye of the people subjected to their watchful supervision would collect the revenue it would be the business andinterest of every citizen to see that officers were honest and that faithfulness and economy should be the rule of public conduct the national government would through their representative branch make known their money necessitics and equalize the burdens between the states imi proportion to their wealth the hope of protectionists is that direct taxation in its operation upon the landholding class will be unpopular so long as tile stupidity of that class who by protection are robbed of dollars where cents would suffice under the equalizing influence of free trade and direct taxation justifies the hope just so long will protected classes wield the lash over the people of this country a fair estimate of the cost of protection to the people basing the calculation on the consumption of protected articles the profits of which go into the pockets of a class ad a section will exhibit the fact that it costs the people fourfold the amount necessary to defray all public expenditures the impoverishment of their country by protection ruinously reduces the value of their property and the subsidies of protection that they imperceptibly expend largely exceeds the cost of direct taxation one of the most serious misfortunes that has resulted from the war is the destruction of the trade relations that existed between the cerealgrowing regions of the northwest and the cotton regions of the south and the highest duty of congress is the adoption of some policy that will conduce to the reestablishment of those relations for the benefit of the whole country the energies of the people of the cotton states should be directed to and concentrated in its production the step necessary to accomplish this great result is to place commutinication on such a footitg that they can secure the cheap s irps breadstuffs and meats of the northwest independett of every benefit that would result to each of the sections named independent of the vastly increased production of export wealththat would result from it the gravest political considerations demand that the two peoples be tied together by cheap lines of transfer although i have never believed in the policy of internal improvement by the general government there can be no question that for the general welfare it is now imperatively necessary that the great rivers of the northwest and south be improved and brought into commuuication by such means as will prevent the breaking of balk its the traisfer it is imperatively necessary that we also tlirough some proper artificial connection between the ohio ri er and the navigable waters of tite tlantic should forever put it out of the power of carrying interests to govern the values of the property of the people of the mississippi valley and the south iniprovement of the ohio and mississippi rivers improvement of the tennessee and its connection with the vast system of navigable rivers that traverse a large portit of the cottongrowing regions andempty into the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean aitd the construction of canals to secure water communication from the ohio to ite

cnable us with ease to carry and finally pay oft the imenose burden that the unfortunate conliet between the sections created and unito our1 whole people in bonds of interest and brotherhood that no sectinal clamor can ever disturb it may be objected that largeoutlay is requiredto accomplish these objects a superficial investigation has satisfied me that the highest estimate of the outlay is but small when comipared with the great benefits that would result from it not only would it create new home demands but we would become successful competitors in sale of breadsttffs its europe and throughout the world where demand exists two contending ideas are presented to the people one that they have not capacity to govern themselves wisely and therefore need toasters the other that public servants shall obey their behests and that their will secures wise administration of public affairs it has been my attempt to prove that the first is represented by the republican party that the second is the author of civilization that progress and freedom are its results the leaders of the repubhican party have exhibited their want of confidence in the people this session byusing the morbid sentimentality of zealots to foist a socalled civilrights bill on the country the tendency of which is to centralize authority in the general government and destroy the rightful power of the states and people the colored people are already with the republicau party and their only possible object is through this legislation to establish precedent against fredoto they have further exhibited it by using a rightful demand of the people for cheap transportation to justify assumption of central authority over all carrying interests which fron every consideration of sound policy should be uader the control of the people in the states the two paths and their end and results are apparent to the most common understanding party republicanism is the embodiment of the despotic idea of government real republicanism as inculcated by our fathers aud ingrafted in the ftmdamental law is the idealization of progress the law of advancing civilization and the monuntentalizing of those principles that have been forged for midnkind by countless battles and by the brains of intellectual and humanitarian titans whose naumes have emblazoned the history of christian civilization fdr the past five hmdred years in conclusion i desire to say thnti if republican legislation had not created an unnatural financial condition i should now be for hard money believing as i do that we should be confined to the express stipulation of the constitution and that all credit contrivances different from the money standard of the world are in the interest of plunder unwise legislation has however in my judgment made it necessary that we shoul gradsoally dismantle the strongholds built against the people lest in their immediate overthrow all might be involved in ruin policy and principle are allies sound policy is the highway by whlchpriiciple is applied as illustrated by republican rule it looks to the soastenauce of moncychangers to the protection of monopolies and to the organizing of rings as

whatever duty may be levied upon it but this bill does not affect that rice at all the citizen who consumes rice in this country that comes from the east indies is in no way affected whether it pays

that is now largely supplied by great britain it is imported in its unclean state from the east indies into great britain and cleaned by machines in operation there and is then transported to the west

rice in return cargoes from the east indies and clean it with the machines which we have in this country not only for consumption here but also for reexport again if that can be done without their being obliged to pay duty on it the only question that could arise as to this measure would seem to be whether under the system of such bonded warehouses as it proposes the government would be liable to the frauds suggested by the gentleman from massachusetts that question was submitted to the secretary of the treasury and his answer you have heard from the letter read that there would be no

privileged to live at a time in the history of this country when the development of its industries is so extensive and so rapid and its wants are so pressing and imperious that we need to be constantly on the alert constantly pressing forward and studying the wishes and necessities of the people and their vast and complicated industries or there is great danger that we shall fall behind in the race of progress and instead of promoting it become an obstruction acud a burden the people expect much of the present congress and they are not in a mood to suffor their wants scnd wishes to

the people a stable and clastid currency ice volume sufficient to facilitate commerce and reduce the rat of interest to the average profits of the various branches of industry the other great and pressing need of the country and especially of the west is cheap transportation it is to the ltter subject that i shall address my renarks today i hold sirthat it is one of the first and most important of the duties devolving upon the government of a great nation to improve every avadlable channel of internal commerce to keep those channels open to the fullest and freest competition and thereby to snake the exchange of cominodities as cheap as possible both to the producer and consumer this duty is enhanced a hundredfold in a country like the united states whose people are scattered over a vast extent of territory and with industry and productions the most diverse and i say in such a country as this considering our vast extect of territory diversifded industry and productions and the alost incalculable importance and amount of our internal trade this government will be hold to be flagrantly recreant to its duty if it longer permits the channels of commerce to remain under the unrestricted control of huge and voracious monopolies which prey upon the industry of the country plunder the people and oat out their substance that such is the present condition of the internal commerce of this great nation no one who is in the least degree acquainted with the facts will pretend to deny and that such will be the just verdict of condemnation passed bythe people upon us if welonger neglect that pressing and imperious duty no one who is at all acquainted with their temper and feelings can doubt this condition of our internal commerce has been the work of time but chiefly of the last twenty years at first the encroachments of these monopolies were so gradual as to be scarcely noticed but within the last decade their rapid extension their widespread combinations maling competition impossible and the proficiency of their managers in all the tricks of corruption and intrign lave made them at once the wonder the terror and the shame of the country it it because the oppression of these monopolies has become intolerable that the people from maine to california and from the lakes to the gulf now demand of congress that it shall exercise for the protection of their industry the power conferred upon it by the constitution of the united states to regulate commerce among the several states the only excuse that can be found for neglecting this duty heretofore is the want of experience in regulating ca new and wonderful power in locomotion the development c f which hs been more rapid tha the wisest could foresee prior to the year 1850 the greater part of our internal commerce was conducted upon natural and ertificial waterrtes and the policy of the state and national governments was to encourage and assist such enterprises but about that time the development of the railway system became more rapid and has ever since absorbed almost entirely the public attention to the exclusion and neglect of water communication and railway enterprises have been the recipietts of nearly all govecamental mnmicipal and individuel aid everything has been done for encouragement until our railway system by the vastness and rapidity of its development has become the wonder of the world nothing has been done for restriction until that railway system has developed into monopolies the most gigantic and the most powerful for good or evil that ever existed upon earth these monopolies exercise an absolute and despotic power of practically by their freights fixing the value of the products of the industry of a majority of the people the people of the eastern states who reside near to the seaboard and to the great markets of the country do not feel the crushing weight of this power as do the people of the west the people of the western states who are chiefly engaged in raising grain and cattle who reside morethan athousand miles from the seaboard and are entirely dependent upon the railways for transportation during the winter season have been plundered until their patience has become exhausted and they are preparing to resist further extortion it is obvious that the northwestern states suffer more than any other section of the country from

practical question which now presents itself is in iwhat manner cait it be exercised so as most speedily to accomlplish the desired results to give not only immediate but permanrent relief and to interfere as little as practicable ivith the legitiaute business interests of the country sir i am fully conscious that this question is surrounded by great difficulties but i do not think that they are by any means imsurniomtable there are three measures of relief at least two of which i am satislied that we must tand will adopt one measuiro that we must act upon at the present session is the regultion of iserstate commrerce upon railways and here at the very outset ive must not fail to romemtuber that laws do not generally execute themselves a remark which i think we shall soon find by experienc applies very properly to the present subject no matter what laws may be enacted upon this s bject they will be practically a dead letter unless we provide a wise and systematic phn for ciforciig them it iwill be absolutely necessary inm my judgment in order to accomplish this cul to create a raisway bureau or commission the dity of which asill be to collect information upon this subject enforce the regulations which cengress may make and exercise a general supervisory control over the railhays of the cosuntry withouit atteallpting at tlis time to go into the detals of those regulations iwhich i trust will be done by the proper conmiittee at an early lag i am free to say that my opinion is formed as to the general objects which we should seek to accomplish these railways having been created under a grant of the sovereign power made not for the private emoument of individuals but solely for the public good they arc in no senseprivato enterprises and they should in all cases be limitet to a reasei able profit upon the capital actually invested it the work charges for transportation in all eaoes whether for loigor for short distances should berestricted to te reasonible and uniform rate the outrage now so coaition of discritninatieg against places and individuals should be absolutoely prohibited one of the very greatest evils of the present systein is the outragoous extortion whih is practiced upon places in the interior which are wholly dependent upon one railway for transportatioii it is very ctlllllito charge as antllh or snor fo trliaspotation thirty tur forty ioiles as is charged over the same road for teli tiles that distance tei thousand instances oc this kind might be cited for there is scarcely a railway in the country which has not been guilty of it not occasionally but as a constant and systematic practice the superintendent of a imassacisetts railway frankly anod iunocently if a seared conscience could be regarded as an evidence of inneice acknowledged to the railway commissioners that when if carload of freight was hauled only tenumiles on his road he charged twenty dollars more than the rate over the whole road of one hundred and tel miles in other words he charged twenty dollars for not hanlheg it 01e hundred miles as a further illustration of the injustice and inequality of the present system take the following faets as reported by a meeting of tlhe business nu of rochester new york in 1872 coods were shipped from the city of new york to tndiana for twentyfive citt pr hundred oinds whionfrom

greaterfrom ochoter to bufllo than it is front buffalo to minnesota this nnjust nnaequ antiid oippressive system of chargcs necessarily trives almost every species of indastry except farming to competing points and favored localities maiufacturing in their midst so much desired by agricultural communities can never be made successful so long as this system is suffered to continue it is unjusa to all but by far the most oppressive to the iuhabitants of the agrieniltural districts equally unjust is the practice common on alt railways of giving special cheap rates to certain favored individuals tlin helping tbm to monopolize business and prc eut the farmer and smaller dealer front shipping their produce and right here i desire to call attention to a nether of the vcy worst features of this ontrageous system nameely the power which it gives to railway companiesand they have not neglected to use itof discriminating against the waterroutes so that they cannot be used except by those who can reach them without the aid of raihays a notable instance of this kind fell under my observation a few months ago in september last i was passing through the state of minnesota and i found the people everywhere indignant at the then recent action of the leading railway companies in raising the freight upon wheat three cents per bushel it was estimated that that increase robbed the farmers of minnesota of 900 000 you may imagine that their just indigmationwas not lessened when the general superintendent of one of the leading railways made the explanation that the increase was not intended to apply to through freights by rail but only to shipments to points on the mississippi river therefore it view of these facts i say that it will be of very little benefit to the people of the interior to improve the navigation of the great rivers if the railways are not prevented from discriminating a ginst them it is sometimes easier to illustrate the workings of a system by talcing an example confined within comparatively narrow limits than to view it in its broadest application i noticed during last september that a cry went up from the farmers of the umpqua valley in oregon oii account of air advance of the railway tariff of seven cents per bushel upon wheat the simple fae was that there had been an advance in the price of wheat in the iiarket aud the railway company proposed that the benefit of that advaueo should acerne to the common carrier instead of the farmerwhoso hard labor had produced the wheat and who upon every principle of fairness ald justice was entitled to the advance the editor of the portland oregonian in commenting upon these facts aptly remarks it would seen a if the railwa ey coipany sitoply wtched rite fluctuations in the price of wheat and ajustd its tariff so as to draw to itself every cent tctat the tarmer could possibly eetand sir this practice bas a broader field and more numerous victims the farncrs of the whole northwest are robbed in the same way and the aggregate of their losses amounts to a sum so enormous that we can no longer woider that the gaeat trinlr lines of railway are able to pay large dividends notwithstanding their reckless management and the vast sums paid for salaries and purposes of corruption when navigation closes each year the railway tariff rpon grai between saint louis or chicago and new york city is advaneed from tela to liftecen cents per bushel to show nore clearly what the farners are losing by higlifrights take the following table of the irmber of bushels of wheat corn onts rye barley nd buckwheat produced in the year 1871 in the northivestcrn states as given in rite agricilturai reports estinste the loss upon the entire crop at tel cenrs per bushl which is

moderate statement of the depreciation of value of those crops in the states nained and the direct loss to those states would of course bo in proportion to the anmonnt sold inl other markets but if we ivere to tdd to the above the losses upon other crops i believe that two hundred millions would be a moderate estimate of the yearly losses of the people of the north western states from railway

262 700 but not to pursue these details further it is evident what are the wrongs we are called upon to redress and what must be the leading features of the regulationis to which railway companies should be sub jected the evils of railway management under tie present system are great and the remedy to be applied must be thorough radical and coextensive with the abuses to be removed it will be necessary to subject railway companies to a system which shall compel honesty aol economy in the administration of their affairs which shall provent the paying of princely salaries and the squandering of misoiney for purposes of corruption and intrigo which shalt restrict their earuings to a fair percentage upon the capital actually invested which shall require their charges to be reasonable for

injurious to tie ublie or to the holders of railway stocks or bonds the project of buihling a government railway exclnsively for freight between the atlautic ssaboard and the mississippi rivei rais iany advocates invarions parts of thecountry 1 amnot coummitted to that project because i do notthink there has yet bien a srliicicnt expression of the publiejudgmnt in regard to it to justify 515 in 1itdertaking a project of that kind and magnitude if we com ence building government railways it is not easy to see exactly where we shall stop but it is usdoubtedly trite that such a railway managed in the interest of the public wnold accomrplish results of incalculable good which it will be dihlicilt and prhalps may be impossible to attain hi any other way the first important result of a railway so irraraged woruili ie to restore competition under the present system there is no competition anong railways and never will be except upon extraordinary occasions anti for sihort intervals not a

but give us one railway betwccni the east am tire west which will not combine with the others and conlpetition is instaitly restored give us a government railway that will carry wheat from tire mississippi river to the atlantic for ten cents per hushel itand every one of the railways between those points must and will carry ot tire stne rate give us a government railway with charges so lwuv that with honest and economical management it will pay only 6 per cent interest on the capital invested and the oter railways will be cornpolled not only to make the samne low charges but breitrg deprived of the chaoe of levying an inlimited tax upon the inidustry qf the country they will also be compelled to piactice honesty and economy in their management i am satisfied that reasonable and equitable rains just both to the people and the railways can be better and more surely secured inthis way than any other and i am sum it is the only way in which competition can be secured while the waterroutes are closed inl winter and we should riot forget while discussn g this sib jece that no tnatter how good the water communications may bothlre will ahways be a vst amouutof business for which the waterroutes can iever cnsnrpete with the railways i refer to tirat irntntrse comrrerce which considerations of time and convenience will alwarys give to the railways in preference to any less rapid means of corvcyaucc mixed ownership or the ownershipof apart of the raihsaysby the govermient and a part by private corporations is not an untried experiment in belgiun the governmenot owns about onethird of iho railways and experience ia that country has fully justilied the system and demonstrated that the ownership and operation of a part by the goveniment in the interest of the people absolutely prevents combinations and maintains the most active corepetitiol and if we find it to be impracticable to secure cheap and erpitable rates in this country by laws regulating the managaement of such railways as we already have we shall be compelled to resort to the system of government ownership of a part wlinch has proved so succossful it other comitris various objectiors are raised against connectiog the government in any way with the manageriert or ownership of railways the strongest opposition eomies from chose who are opposed to what they term paterniat govermnnit or the meddling of the government with the business affairs of the people but certainly there has never been a government of a civilized people which did noti meddle with theh business if the regulation tf commerce can ire criled meddling and there is not necessarily any difference in principle bretween the building of a railway by government ir the interest of corrnrere ard the bilding of a canal the most strenuous opponents of government interference must adroit that the necessity nry arise in various branches of business where it would become the duty of the government to interfere for the protection of the eople against tmonopoly or overwhelming combination and oppression perhaps there is no rrewspilpe ir the cotntry more determined it its opposition to paternal govcrnmen than the nation of new york yet in its issue of february 6 1872 it admits the principle which would justify such irterfercnce in an article opposing the postal telegraph as follows there is bto case wich

believe thaf the language above quoted is now fully applicable to our railway system that that bwnch of the business of the comtry is so monopolized that citizens can no longer share in or control it and so misuanaged that they can no longer endure it the railway system is a monopoly in its very nature each railway iucompany has a grant of certain exclusive rights and privileges with which no other person or corporation can interfere being a public bighway its rights are held to be ouperior to all private rights and in case rf corflice the lcter irusi yiehl the railway which obtains the irst grant and location is presumed to occupy the shortest and best rorte between its terminal points to the exclusion of all intriders and this of itself amounrts to a nronopoly lint even if the businss is so great as to justify the building of a parallel road tihn combinatiot takes place and destroys competitiot competition will orever as a rule exist in any business except in tire presence of comrtpeting forces too raunmeanm to conmubine and it must be perfectly evident to the most casual observer that this can never be the case in respect to railways it nver has been the case oven at the great railwry center but even if that could be it would result irr no betnefit to the tells of thonsands of other places which are not so favorably situated again it is nrrged byotlrers i l lrr great solieitade frr the welfare of the railwavs that the building and operation by the governent of a railway which should alord creap transportation to the people would interfere with the vested rights of railway companies alrnody created would depreciate ther property and rerder them balekruipt this argument certairly adirits one thing namely that the people would get cheap transportation as the proposition is trot to build a government railway to dobnsiness for nothing but for a reasemale lirolit it is difficult to see what vested rights of the railvay compnics awould be distrbed nnless

promote that great cual i trust that we shall trot iesitate to give it our approval sir in conclusion for i see that my tie is ahready exhausted let me entreat tse atteution of the house to the best the surest the most permanent means for securing cheap transportation for our internl janquary 31 commerce by the improvement of the great rivers the channels conmnecting the great lakes and by the construction of such canals as are absolutely needed and are of national importance that vast section of country known as the mississippi valley unequaled in fertility which now contains nearly onehall of the population of the united states and which is destined at no distant day to contain an immense majority of that population which is unrivaled in the production of the great staples of agriculture and contains mines the extent and wealth of which cannot be estimated is also most abundantly supplied with natural facilities for cheap transportation bounded on the north by the lakes and on the south by the gulf and with great rivers stretching throughout its entire extent comprising in all nearly ten thousand miles of navigable river the mississippi valley possesses the grandest system of water communication which can be found in any part of the world but those lakes and rivers like everything else upon earth are imperfect and require improvement to fit them for their highest uses time improvements heretofore made have qenerally been of a temporary nature and such as the bare necessities of the case demanded liut the time has come when a change of policy is absolutely temanded by the necessities of the people of that section within the last twenty years the population and products of the mississippi valley have increased with a rapidity and to an extent heretofore unparalleled in the history of the world and the means of transportation that were adequate ten years ago now fall far short of meeting the demands of the immense commerce of that valley in regard to the natural and most obvious remedy for this want the views which i expressed in the speech to which i have heretofore alluded i have found no reason for changing and i therefore reproduce a few sentences although the mississippi river is navigable for more than two thousad miles and has a channel usually deep and broad enough to meet nil she requirements of the immense comemerce if this valley yet obstructions are found at various places and at others are constantly formed by the shifting sands the greatest difficulty is found at the mouth of the river where the sediment carried by the current set ties and accumulates leaving the channel so shallow as to require constanbdredging situ even that affords but s small part of the relief required and ocean steamers leaving new orleans loaded with grain for the great narkets of the east mnd of enrope are constantly stranding upon the everaccumulating sands at the moth of the river and are compelled to unload and reload their carg es at great expene before they can finally start upon their ocean voyage all ths adds greaily to the cost of transportation and is all a tax upon the producers various projects are nowin contemplation calclated to relieve th internal comnerces of the country from ralnoad monopoly by a system of canals to be constructed by the government and free to all m1anyoftese are doubtless impracti cable or would be too expensive to justify their construction but others are not only practicable but woeld be of soch inestmablevalue that 1 is almost uiaccictalule that they have been so long neglected in my judgment the first in impeftneo and in its perfect practicability is the project known as the fort saint philip canal wih starting from the tississippirivcra few miles above its month wo l run six and a half miles through a counitry perfectly flat and lower even than the river in high water and but little higher chan the galf and into the gulf of stexico at a point where its depth is always sufficienttfor the largest vessels a single lock at the point of convergence from the river would shut out the current and the sand lily this route i belliev that your grin could be shipped to the city of itew york r 50 cr cent loss than it can ever be done by railroads and more than 100 per cent lcss than the railroads charge at preoet this canal of such inestimabl value to the millions of people who inhabit the great valley of the mississippi would cost less than the postoflfico in the city of now york 1perhap eceond in importance is the prqject of uniting lake michigan with the mississippi river through the medium at the mllinois river and a shipcaial thus ctnlectin the navigation of the mississippi and missouri rivers with the grea lakes thesaint lawrence and hudson rivers and the erie canal and affording facilities for internal commerce ncqualed in any other part of the world i do not by any means assume or take it for granted that these works to which i have referred are the only ones of the kind which should be undertaken by the government for i feel assured that after the fort saint philip canal which i regard a first there are several others of nearly equal merit and importance all of which i trust will receive due consideration when presented the constniction ofthefort saigt philip canal andthe imapovement of the navigation of the mississippi and missouri rivers and their tributaries which must be the logical sequence of that work will furnish a cheap and safe outlet to the ocean for that which is desined at no distant day to be the greater part of the commerce of the united states and it should in myjudgment be among the very first subjects to receive the attention of congress great and not unmerited praise has been bestowed upon the fortyth i d congress because it has inaugurated this grand system for providing cheap transportationhas appointed cimmittees to investigate to collect facts and to report upon the subject with a view not only to the regulation of railways but to the construction of canals nd the improvement of rivers the work of preparation has been far advanced and we are now near to the time when the work of legislation must begin if we fail in our duty we may retard but we cannot defeat the will of the people nor change the destiny of this great nation the edict has gone forth these improvements must and will be made the grasp of monopoly must be loosened from our commercee the nightmare of corruption must be shaken off if we fail we shall receive the just condemnation of the people and wiser men will be sent to take our places and perform thoseduties which nve have neglected but i feel assured that we shall not fail that we shall catch the spirit of the peopri whose will it is our duty to obey and who have spoken emphatically thongh with deliberation upon this great question and let economy go hand in hand with these improvements instead of squandering unnecessary millions upon palatial postoffices and customhouses let us cut off every extravagant expenditure and devote the surplus revenuesto the great and beucticucv work of providing cheaper traansportation to the end that the

greatest care and labor showingthe tribal distributioi of the indian nations one hundred antd lifty or two hundred years ago without feeling himself instructed as to the condition of indian affairs then if this would eiable is to get such a mass now if it would enable us to obtain it so we would have at one view a picture of what their condition is and a trief chronological history of these tribes we woald be able to know something mre about them in this connection lot me say we have treated the indians as though they were a reperition of the same unit we tet as though ai indian is an indian wherereryon fild him failing torecognize there is a marked difference between them the hill indian an indian born with all his associations among the mountains is scarcely able to subsist himself upon the plains the indian on the staked plains of the south hardly knows hew to live in the timber lands or in the mountains yet we undertake to gather a whole miscellaneous group of tribes of indians and put them upon one reservation where if one tribe can live because the surroundings are what they have been accustomed to the others are unable to thrive because they are surrounded by nothing they have been accustomed to it is like taking a tropical plant and planting it in the snows of maine or taking a hardy plant of the north and planting it under the equator now if we tre to behave intelligently to these indians we ought to know something about the locality of their tribes and their history and i believe this small appropriation will help ns i am in favor of it"],

to this appropriation it is all proper enough for this government to take care 0f these orphans in this district but this provision contains within it what may properly be termed a bill of attainder it can be nothing else i have been relieved of my disabilities as have thousand of others yet here is a provision in this bill appropriating money out of the common treasury of tho country for the support of aninstitution excluding certain class of children from it because of the crimes or penalties of their fathers that is in effect a bill of attainder and the constitution of this country if it ho regarded at all at its very inception in the very outset contains as one of the most cherished principles of this government that congress should never pass any bill of attainder from the day when our rebel ancestors cut loose from the alleiance to the crown of great britain to this no such thing has ever cbn attempted but here against the orphans of those who fought against that flag who
