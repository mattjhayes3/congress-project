foreign aid it is my information that secretary acheson in testifying before a congressional committee recently stated that in the next 3 years the united states would be called upon to spend 25 000 000 000 in foreign aid those of us in the congress who are responsible for putting the 0 k on these expenditures are aroused over the program of this administration for foreign expenditures which in the judgment of most economists is reaching the breaking point the united states alone cannot feed the world neither can it finance its economic or military operations in order that my position may not be misunderstood i want to say that i have supported all legislation for appropriations for national defense believing that we should keep our nation militarily strong to enable us to defend our country against any attack thus far i have also voted for foreign aid i also favor a payasyougo policy and am opposed to deficit spending and believe that we should not saddle the debts of one generation upon a succeeding generation except in cases of great emergency i feel that this nation cannot feed finance and arm all the world outside the iron curtain and for that reason it behooves us to reappraise our resources and financial ability and make drastic reductions in government expenses particularly in all programs for overseas expenditures where the same are not absolutely essential the time has come to give some consideration to our own people we are providing finances for public works of all types river and harbor improvements flood control hydroelectric development waterworks public buildings and a myriad of other public improvements overseas while we are drastically curtailing similar improvements here at home which are vitally needed for our own economy i believe the time has come to use some of these billions of dollars we have been spreading around the world for the development of our own economy and the protection of our people here at home the american taxpayer is being bled white there are millions of our old people and lowincome groups who are finding it difficult to make ends meet and keep the wolf from the door with the meager incomes they are receiving and the swollen prices under inflation for the necessities of life many of the european nations to which we are furnishing substantial foreign aid are in a better economic condition than is the united states many of them have an overall per capita indebtedness less than ours and they are able to balance their budgets whereas we have been operating in the red almost continuously since 1932 the total expenditures of this government have reached such staggering proportions that we are brought to the realization that a break must be put on our spending if our financial structure is to be held intact the late president roosevelt said in an early campaign that any nation like any individual who continually spends more than it receives was headed for the poorhouse and bankruptcy how ominous those words are when we consider what has been spent by the roosevelt and truman administrations since the words were uttered the following tabulation vividly expresses in dollars this startling expense program period receipts expenditures debt all presidents to 1933 91 586 076 130 112 203 367 065 22 538 672 154 roosevelt administration fiscal 1934 to 1945 165 760 825 357 372 235

000 in arms while europe can scrape up less than eight billions the administration forces now tell us we must arm all of western europe yet europe is in the center of the4war danger zone and sitting on the powder keg the nine nations allied in the north atlantic group have 175 000 000 people western germany 48 000 000 the industries of those nations are turning out 44 percent more goods than they did before world war ii but yet these nations in the year ahead plan to spend only 8 000 000 000 on its own defense while the administration is calling upon the united states with only 150 000 000 people to spend 45 000 000 000 for arms even though we are far removed from the battle area and certainlymuch more remote from danger than the nations of europe the communists have boldly proclaimed that the united states will spend itself into disaster russia is sitting by biding its time while we are well along the road on our spending spree as reported in the august 10 issue of united states news and world report in the year ahead the united states will spend on its armed forces 40 500 000 000 and will make available in military aid to europe five and twotenth billions the allies of the united states in europe will spend on their armed forces seven and ninetenths billions the postwar loans and grants to europe prior to the marshall plan cost the united states nine and sixtenths billions marshallplan aid to europe to date has cost the united states eleven and seventenths billions the proposed 3year plan of military and economic aid to europe would cost 20 700 000 000 as reported in the united states news and world report the president is planning an overall expenditure for the fiscal year of over 71 000 000 000 it will probably be nearer a hundred billion if he has his way if the congress authorizes the present request for foreign aid the total authorized gifts loans and credits in the past 10 years will aggregate 124 000 000 000 the united states has only 6 percent of the population of the world yet we are attempting to feed finance and equip for war the entire world outside the iron curtain it is high time for the taxpayers to call for an accounting and a stop to the flagrant waste of our resources the people of the united states are entitled to known why it is that those in control of the government since 1933 have kept our country almost continuously in war and made it possible for the communist government of russia to extend its domination from 170 000 000 people in 1945 to 800 000 000 today and to spend more than all other administrations in our history combined and why it is that we lack effective forthright farsighted leadership at home and abroad and why it is that notwithstanding billions appropriated for national defense we found ourselves inadequately prepared to meet the korean conflict this lack of leadership and the willingness to accept political expediency has left us confronted with exorbitant prices mounting taxes dwindling savings and insolvency we are attempting to substitute billions of dollars for effective and forthright leadership and to substitute bullets for statesmanship no armed force

macarthurs brazen disregard for the truth when in his chicago speech on april 26 he blamed the slaughter of american boys in korea on a national policy he called unrealistic the truth is that the gross incompetence and inefficiency of general macarthurs intelligence headed by maj gen charles willoughby was directly responsible for the frightful and needless slaughter and horrible death by freezing of thousands of american soldiers in korea last december in those 2 weeks in december our casualties were perhaps greater than the total of the previous 5 months of the war in korea i do not know of a single instance in modern military history where a main striking force was ordered to advance in such a spreadout fashion in enemy territory by a command which was so unbelievably ignorant of enemy disposition striking power and intentions as was the case last december the american soldiers were ordered into what amounted literally to a valley of death for thousands of them only the courage and superior mechanization of our troops enabled them to avoid a complete annihilation and to fight their way out of the trap in any case it was one of the most disastrous military setbacks received by our forces in american history the shocking incompetence of macarthurs intelligence staff first came to light last june when he had no more idea of the north korean military potential or intentions than we did at home 6 000 miles away later in the home for christmas offensive both french and british intelligence warned on the basis of their information that the chinese might strike if our troops approached the yalu river reservoirs but macarthur ignored these warnings i have had enough experience with guerrillas behind enemy lines in northern yugloslavia during world war ii to have some idea of what can or cannot be done in this type of campaign i know that it is possible to infiltrate agents into enemy territory and obtain a reasonable knowledge of enemy buildups and to calculate the possibility and nature of a sudden offensive it is a fact that north korean agents and later whole combat guerrilla units constantly infiltrated into south korea and kept their command informed of all developments i know that it would likewise have been possible to send south korean agents into north korea to obtain needed information upon which to base our military decisions but apparently general macarthur and major general willoughbys intelligence was confined to presumptions and guesses made in the sheltered vantage point of tokyo rather than field intelligence work it was their duty to secure proper information and they failed in their duty the loss of men in combat is always terriblebut the needless waste of brave men in unsound military moves based on faulty intelligence due to grossest kind of incompetence and stupidity is more ihan terrible official reports show we have lost over 62 000 americans killed wounded captured and missing in koreainasmuch as official reports are always behind time and the total does not include such noncombat injuries as frostbite it is probable that our actual casualties today exceed 75 000 the horrible thing about this situation is that thousands of these men would be alive today if it had not been for macarthurs illfated drive to the yalu last december it occurs to me that congress should make a full investigation of macarthurs conduct of the war and his colossal mill tary blunder of last december it also seems to me that special emphasis should be placed on he examination of the inefficiency and incompetence of major general willoughby upon whose intelligence work macarthur relied and which makes them jointly responsible for the mistakes of last winter it is my understanding that both general macarthur and major general willoughby are free to appear before congressional committees and that macarthur has already been scheduled to appear before both the house and senae armed services committees it seems to me that the following questions should be put to both of them first why did willoughby and macarthur completely underestimate the strength of the north korean armies last june second why did these two officers miscalculate the strength striking power and intentions of the chinese armies when our troops were ordered to advance to the yalu last december third why was the advice of french and british intelligence ignored completely when they warned that the chinese would attack if our troops were ordered to move to the yalu fourth why did macarthur throw the flower of the american army of the far east into an indefensible and untenable military position during subzero weather with overextended supply lines and without proper equipment last december fifth how will it be possible to cut american casualties now being suffered in a limited war by extending the scope of the war into china these are some of the questions that i would like to see asked and i am sure that other members

try to fight your way through the 30 000 who serve on the general staff over there where top brass is a dime a dozen i never saw so many people looking for something to command at last their grand strategy has taken form and gone into action it is a classic in military deception the only fault i find is that it has picked the wrong target an enveloping movement designed to capture all fit 18yearolds in the united states so that the inflated military hierarchy may be guaranteed permanent employment at the expense of american youth will only succeed in becoming known as operation backfire it is true that many of our young men when they get out of high school or reach this employable age are anxious to make a start in life but they do not relish the prospect of being impressed into military service as a routine matter in time of peace they would much rather graduate from any other institution than umt knowing this the pentagon has tried to sugarcoat the whole deal so that we will swgllow this bad pill and bad bill before we realize its consequences to start off it has such an innocent label when i first heard of the national security training corps i associated it with the unification of the boy scouts the 4h clubs and all the summer camps that are conducted for the benefit of our young men i soon learned that the project under wraps that is vaguely outlined in h r 5904 bears no resemblance to the fine voluntary organizations i have just mentioned the fact that the military bureaucrats are trying to slip this one over in disguise is a confession that they are being somewhat less than honest with the american public they try to water down its drastic break with our nonmilitary tradition by avoiding any specific date for umt to begin but h r 5904 would permit what is called a small experimental program just to get a foot inside the door that protects the united states at large from the exponents of a garrison state i think that we have done pretty well according to the record with our present system in two world wars one of them global in its problems and demands we were able to field large and effective armies after a period of training because we had a good professional core to build upon but now even with a much much larger standing army than we ever had we are being asked to approve of a total military influence over the lives of our young men in perpetuity and after they are placed in a reserve tatus what then they will still reluire refresher training to make them ombat ready i believe that a volunteerbased mfliary establishment of sufficient size and lways ready is the best answer to our ailitary needs and one that does not stablish as a national policy the reginentation of this nations youth a striking force in being is our best defense and on the alert not in a mothball civilian reserve without this everready frontline of professionals 20 000 000 reserves might never get the chance to be called up for the fir t blow will be the deciding one if there ever is another major war complete and overwhelming surprise is the one great danger with jets and guided missiles on the way the leisurely methods based on the nineteenth century military experience of europe will not be of much help it seems to me that the department of defense which should be prepared to intercept and defeat the swiftmoving dangers of today and tomorrow could do better than to offer us this soupedup version of an old and discredited theory a backlog of 5 000 000 french soldiers was no match for the blitzkrieg of a few welltrained panzer divisions the pentagon tries to alibi our early reverses in korea by deploring the lack of reserves it almost broke their hearts to call the national guard units and veterans of world war ii back to active duty according to the pentagon now and this is the booby trap if we only had umt at the time this would not have happened in fact this is but a shabby coverup we had reserve units but the military failed to give them proper training they were not brought up to date in the handling of weapons or in the experience that comes from working out problems in the field even regular army service troops scraped together for shipment to korea were as green as recruits because they had never been trained to fire a mortar i submit that the old standby of getting there fustest with the mostest men which has dominated military thinking belongs in the ashcan for the first few precious months or weeks after a war or as they say a police action occurs i would rather depend on a dozen besttrained and hardhitting divisions than a horde of militia what protection would we have with an air force of 15 000 obsolete planes in mothballs if we did not have fleets of bombers and fighters ready for the takeoff it is a wonder they have not learned something from the tested program of the united states marines who prove that quantity is never a substitute for quality desk soldiers and paper training will never deter an aggressor and a home guard will not do it the military defense of this nation is a fulltime job and it is getting to be a highly technical one we cannot rely on amateurs the central core of our military organization is good it simply needs some professional expansion i have every respect for our military leaders in their field but when they step out of line and try to extend and perpetuate their influence over the lives of all american youth i say it is time to call a halt why why was this measure proposed in the first place when it will not give us any real military security six months would be inadequate training and in event of war it would still take time to retrain reserves and form them into units judged by the past performance of the pentagon we already have several million americans serving in the armed forces the selective service system can provide for replacements as needed and both can be scaled up or down depending upon future developments in the world situation the people through congress will still maintain civilian control over the powercomplex from which many generals and admirals suffer but if universal military training ever gets a compulsory toehold on this nation it will never let go even in principle our forefathers thought they had put 3 000 miles and more between themselves and this hated form of regimentation which is symbolic of old world tyranny here it is breathing down our necks again and there is no welcome wilderness to which we can escape we can understand up to a point the ambitions of the high brass but we do not intend to satisfy them by handing over american youth on a platter with all the trimmings the chain of command has its place but not all over the place this

russia under a trade agreement that the plants could not produce equipment for british rearmament it is apparent that immediate and drastic action must be taken if we expect the american public to

many points which argue for its construction but in my judgment the amendment offered by the gentleman from kansas is not the proper way in which to approach the initiation for construction of this

the total which this bill authorizes for all construction under flood control the method used by the gentleman from kansas would deprive 5 000 000 from the total funds for 55 other projects in the bill the real way to join the issue on tuttle creek is to offer an amendment to increase the bill in this particular by 5 000 000 then you are not involving any of the other 55 projects which under

gentlemans contribution because it is in line with my own observations here i appreciate the gentlemans comment i may add there that blueprints do not shoot and you are not going to win any future combat in the air unless you have those jets off the drawing board they are not going to get off the drawing boards unless we get these particular metals on hand and coming along in sufficient quantity then we shall see a mad scramble to reshule authority over mineral production a rush of new programs intended to bring out metals and minerals and no doubt a myriad of explanations as to why this action had not taken place before and further when this starvation diet of metals occurs it will be accompanied by layoffs at industrial plants the migration of labor to other jobs a loss of payrolls and howls by labor for action action which should have been taken months ago another illustration i could add here at this point of my own is this we wrote the stockpile act into law and it was signed by the president on july 23 1946 we set up a 5year program intending to acquire enough of these strategic and critical materials so that when war should strike we would not be caught entirely short after 4 years of that on july 23 1950 the stockpile had acquired only about 34 percent of that yardstick or goal and after the war started in korea we found the officials in charge of that program suddenly upped the yardstick to nearly double of what it had been prior to that that is exactly contrary to what we had in mind when we wrote the stockpile law in 1946 we intended to have enough acquired by the time that war came so that we would not have to do that very thing but at that time they had only about 34 percent of the stockpile program on the smaller budget or yardstick that they had set prior to the korean war i could cite numerous examples of the bottlenecks in the minerals and metals program but i shall not bore you with their details many of you are more familiar with specific cases than i am however i would like to point out some of the stumbling blocks that hamper the minerals program and make mining men throw up their hands in disgust i have literally run around in circles from one agency to another vainly trying to get accurate information and effective action i might add at this point the observation that in my opinion those of us who wrote the stockpile act recognize in paragraph i of that act which is public law 520 of the seventyninth congress that the health of the domestic mining industry was of greater importance than the stockpile they are both important but the health of the domestic mining industry is of greater importance to our self sufficiency national defensewise than the stockpile itself in the first place there are no clearcut requirements for metals and minerals the munitions board has not figured out the military requirements for these raw materials goals set by the munitions board were retained at less than 4 000 000 000 total throughout the first 4 years of their administration of public law 520 of the seventyninth congress the stockpile act then after the korean war broke the goal vas raised to 8 870 000 000 by december 31 1950 the uncertainty and confusion is rampant that is a serious indictment of failure of the munitions board to grasp their responsibility and their duty under that act therefore the other agencies are somewhat at a loss as to their goals despite this fact however they have not made any real concrete progress because of inertia policy tifts and outandout jealousy over their various prerogatives the defense minerals administration staffed by mining industry men anxious to get a program going has been hobbled in its efforts by a group in the secretary of the interiors office who have become masters of the tactics of delaying important policy decisions and minerals development programsalthough none of them have had any experience in mining at the present time this group is still sitting on programs submitted by dma months ago programs that are not bottlenecked at this point become pigeonholed in the general services administration where at the present time many longterm purchase contracts lie dormant while the nation cries for the materials these contracts would bring out another agency equally guilty in preventing mineral development is the office of price stabilization failure to face up to realities and set ceiling prices for metals and minerals in line with the world markets has caused muchneeded metals to flow to other nations and has kept mines closed in our own country that only need an adequate and firm price to unlock their hidden wealth is it therefore little wonder that a mining official recently said anything thats been accomplished by the metals industry in the past year has been in spite of the government and not because of it it is high time that congress forcibly express its views on what needs to be done to bring order out of this chaos in the minerals program to remove the uncertainty that exists and stimulate our domestic mining industry in my own mind the simple solution that can be readily arrived at under existing law is for all mineral policies and program to be developed by one agency directed by that agency and brought to conclusion by that agency it is my suggestion that a top mining man be made responsible for development of mineral policy and programs to aid him in this work the policy and program functions as they apply to metals and minerals now dt dged in the interior department should be divorced from that department and placed under this one responsible man who should be given full authority to direct the various other major agencies participating in any minerals program to carry out dpa policies and get the domestic mining industry into full production this top minerals staff which must be manned by experienced mining personnel could be placed directly in the office of defense mobilization gentlemen we are at the crossroads in our mineral preparedness even now it may be too late to salvage our production program but there is an outside chance that we can get our mineral program on the right track let us hope that for our national security that those in chat ge of our defense will quickly see the light and take the needed steps now to insure a strong domestic mining industry"],

except 25 i could name case after case literally hundreds of them but time does not permit mr owen lattimore has been the most successful operator in the country in milking these foundations of money

to any member of that committee democrat or republican liberal or reactionary i say to you that some of the foundations as they are now being administered represent to some reasonable extent the lattimore school of thought now an effort has been made to show that the work of this proposed committee would encroach upon the committee on ways and means there is nothing in the resolution that would make it possible for this committee to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means nobody would want that an effort has also been made to prejudice the committee on unamerican activities against the resolution by contending that the committee as it would function would encroach upon the jurisdiction of that committee i introduced a similar resolution last year and it was reported out by the committee on rules but i considered broadening its provisions in order to get into the educational field and that is the field where congress should go to make some investigation i knew the committee on unamerican activities had done some work on this subject so i took it up formally with them i addressed to the chairman a communication and called his committees attention to the fact that i was considering broadening the provisions of the resolution so as to make possible inquiry into the infiltration of communism into the textbooks that are being used in the schools throughout the country that communication was read before the committee and the committee reported that they had several years ago done considerable spadework on this subject and i know they did they have made a record that is very valuable they reported that they contemplated getting back into the field at an early date therefore i abandoned the idea of broadening the resolution i simply reintroduced it with the date for making report changed the foundation idea is not new there were foundations a thousand years before christ the egyptians had them the romans had them they have come on down they spread into england to the extent where they administered a fund of more than a million pounds a year 150 years ago in 1918 a royal commission was formed for the purpose not of taking over the foundations not of prosecuting the foundations but of investigating in order to be certain that the foundations were functioning in accordance with the purposes of the donors and not against the public interest so in the instant case that is all that is requested the english set up a commission to supervise the foundations the foundations here have never been investigated there has never been any sort of governmental supervision there is a conflict of ideas as to their virtue i remember mr frank walsh in the congressional investigation of another subject took the position that foundations were a menace to the public welfare and he was reasonably supported to the extent that they could become so by mr walburg by mr justice brandeis and by a great many others who took the position that a foundation should not be founded in perpetuity mr walsh took the position that the government ought to recapture the money that had been filched from the people through the foundation device i do not agree with that i think that when a man comes to die it ought to be his right to make disposition of his funds as he sees fit so long as it is consonant with the public interest"],
