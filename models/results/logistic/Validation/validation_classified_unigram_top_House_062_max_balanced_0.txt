laws regulating land in the united states are not in force in alaska we have special laws for them and they might not be effective i do not know whether they would be effective or not i do not know whether the mining laws would be effectivei do not know whether anybody else knowsunder the provisions of this bill i do not object to the passage of the bill although it is perfectly plain that it either will not accomplish what the people of alaska want it to accomplish or else it will go away beyond what congress intends to confer upon alaska i have no objection to the people of alaska controlling themselves in the ordinary police control that is local but the resources of alaska do not belong to the people who now happen to be there most of whom are not there for their natural lives most of whom do not intend to remain there any longer than is necessary to accumulate a little and then come back to the states in the control of the police matters it may be fair to give them power although everyone knows that if they were given unrestricted powers over police matters it would not be to their interest this bill recognizes that fact by proposing to take away from them or by not conferring upon them the power over gambling and lotteries and things of that sort the bill when enacted into law and the legislature when it meets will be a disappointment both to the people of alaska and the congress it does not meet the problems which ought to be met in relation to alaska think of it with great coal fields there they ship coal in from outside we have not attempted by legislation so far to properly meet those questions i am not criticizing anyone because it is a great problem which possibly no one yet has solved we ought to sit down seriously and solve it does the gentleman from alaska or anyone else think that we are more likely to develop the railroads in alaska which is a very important matter after giving to a legislature authority over the matter we give a legislature to alaska but provide in the bill that no municipal corporation may issue bonds it can not make any improvements the territory can make no improvements and having given the authority to a legislature congress is much less likely to make the improvements which would the people of alaska prefer to have a legislature for a toy or to have the real development which may come with a transfer of a part of the implements now upon the panama canal to alaska to help develop that territory you may say they will get both the chances are they will not the two do not go together when we give to the local legislature authority over these matters we do not pay much more attention to them a provision in the bill which has been frequently referred to provides that congress reserves the right to set aside any law that is passed that right was reserved in connection with new mexico and arizona and possibly various other territories i have been here 15 years i remember only one time when we set aside a law i passed by the legislature of one of those territories it was a law that did not amount to anything did not affect anybody which was rushed through both houses of congress as though it was the most important thing in the world it was of absolutely no importance except locally as to the location of ai country or its boundaries i think that is the only case where congress has done anything of the sort not because they have to approve the law but because having given the responsibility to the people there they let the people exercise the responsibility often at their own expense

the construction of public buildings heretofore authorized the bill appropriates as stated the sum of 8 053 517 92 in the regular estimates for public buildings transmitted in the book of estimates the treasury department proposed a new method of appropriating for such public works heretofore there have been appropriated at various times large sums for construction under existing authorizations of public buildings at least 10 000 000 of the sums heretofore appropriated for specific buildings can not be expended upon the particular projects for which the money is available during the ensuing fiscal year the secretary of the treasury set forth in the book of estimates but did not carry into the totals estimates for projects for which the sum of 13 109 701 20 would be required instead of asking that this sum be appropriated he proposed that legislation be enacted which would make one fund of the various specific appropriations heretofore made and in addition that 3 000 000 be appropriated to be added to such fund and asserted that with the control of the 13 000 000 thus made available for use in the discretion of the department upon buildings heretofore or hereafter authorized that equal results could be produced during the next fiscal year as if in addition to the 10 000 000 heretofore appropriated and unexpended specific appropriations aggregating 13 109 701 20 be appropriated the committee did not feel warranted in adopting the reconmendation of the department it would have revolutionized the present method of providing for work upon authorized buildings under the present system specific appropriations are made for particular projects and those interested in any building are able to ascertain definitely the money available for use on the particular project to change that system and to put absolute control over the appropriations in the department to be allotted in the discretion or according to the caprice or prejudices of some official would very greatly increase the irritation discontent and dissatisfaction which appears to be inevitable even under the present method the committee in its recommendations follows the prevailing custom the estimates set out in the book of estimates but not carried into the totals would necessitate appropriations for construction work during the entire ensuing fiscal year aggregating as already pointed out 13 109 701 20 appropriations for the construction of public buildings are excepted from the provisions of the covering in act when made they are available at once and continue available until expended the custom for many years has been to accept the estimate of the supervising architect as to sums required for particular projects and to recommend appropriations strictly in accordance with the estimates in 1910 it was ascertained that as at present large sums had been appropriated in excess of the amounts that could actually be expended in an attempt to prevent the unnecessary segregation of funds in the treasury and the tying up of moneys that could not possibly be used the committee in that year requested that the estimates be revised so as to indicate the various suins required for authorized projects until the 4th of march 1911 the date of the end of the sixtyfirst congress at which time the sundry civil appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1912 would become law such revised estimates were prepared by the department and submitted to the congress and the committee recommended appropriations in accordance therewith the same course has been pursued at this session and in compliance with the revised estimates the committee recommends appropriations aggregating 8 053 517 92 which amount includes appropriations for every site and building which the treasury department states can be expended by the 4th of march 1913 when the next bill carrying such appropriations will become law this practice is not unusual it has been applied to appropriations for river and harbor improvements under contract and has been eminently satisfactory if any other policy were followed it would necessitate the appropriation of 5 056 183 32 additional to the sum recommended in this bill and would result in increasing the appropriations of money for buildings which must necessarily be idle and unused to 15 056 183 32 to do so would be indefensible from any standpoint and the committee has declined to follow such a course it may be of value to state some facts relative to public buildings which at times are overlooked publicbuilding acts were approved june 6 1902 march 3 1903 june 30 1906 may 30 1908 and june 25 1910 under those acts 427 sites for buildings were authorized to be purchased 185 buildings were authorized on sites then owned by the united states 482 sites and buildings combined were authorized 124 additions to existing buildings were provided and the limit of cost was increased on 359 buildings which had been authorized in some act other than the one in which the limit of cost was increased all of these sites and buildings were authorized in bills considered and reported by the committee on public buildings and grounds or placed in such bills by senate amendments the committee on appropriations has no authority to recommend new sites or buildings extensions or increases in the limit of cost of buildings heretofore authorized it has not attempted to do so in this bill the authority of the committee is limited to recommendations of appropriations to carry out projects authorized by law it has not attempted to exceed that authority but has rigidly adhered to the estimates of the treasury department recommending every dollar that can be utilized until march 4 next requests have been made for appropriations that the department states can not be used prior to the enactment of the next bill for authority to exceed the limit of cost for appropriations for buildings that will not be reached unless advanced out of turn over other buildings the committe has not been able to justify such action and has not made such recommendations under date of march 15 1912 the supervising architect submitted the following statement which shows the status of the various authorizations for sites and buildings heretofore printed 1 there are 203 contracts for buildings now in force of which 179 are new buildings and 24 extensions this work is carried out under the direct supervision of 94 superintendents of construction the drawings for g of thc buildings have been prepared by private architects 2 there are 130 projects for which drawings and specifications are in various stages of completion but for which contracts have not yet been awarded of these 97 are new buildings and 33 extensions drawings for 121 of these buildings are being prepared in the office of the supervising architect and for the other 9 by outside architects 3 there are 194 projects all new buildings for which no drawings have yet been commenced 4 there are 172 sites authorized for which no buildings have been provided to complete the buildings heretofore authorized will require 27 750 100 the supervising architects office is so organized as to perform annually about 13 000 000 of work in this bill there is carried 831 920 the amount requested by the department to enable the present speed to be maintained there are at present 652 public buildings owned and used by the united states for the transaction of the public business 128 buildings are under construction and 106 will be completed during the present year the value of the original construction aggregates 169 675 396 including enlargement of buildings 185 000 000 including alterations repairs and maintenance to june 30 1911 201 337 229 including sites which have cost 46 000 000 247 337 229 for the maintenance and upkeep of these buildings the sum 5 172 000 is carried in this bill every building completed adds to the permanent fixed charges upon the treasury and can not be ignored nor evaded this committee does not determine the order in which buildings are placed under construction the supervising architect states that buildings are planned in regular order whenever a site is acquired it is given a number in the office and the preparation of plans proceeds in the order in which the projects are so numbered the secretary of the treasury states that no sites nor buildings authorized under the act of june 25 1910 have been advanced out of this order except as hereinafter stated and the reasons for such advancements are herein given namely 1 austin tex tie reason for this advancement is that it is located at the state capital no contract however has yet been let 2 bangor me advancement is on account of the destruction of the old

indian should select 160 acres as a homestead the osage indians have been in their present territory now for over half a century many of the indians had actual homesteads before the time of allotment

which was in the bottoms or he went somewhere else and selected a valuable bottom 160 acres now the law of 1906 also provided that after the first allotment of 160 acres the indian could select a second parcel another 160 acres that after he had made the second selection he could make a third also of 160 acres and that thereafter he could have his share of the residue remaining after the

climbed to nearly 100 in the shade about everything that can possibly be said on the subject has been said many eloquent speeches have been made and under these circumstances late saturday afternoon it is somewhat of an embarrassment to attempt to discuss the matter even briefly had it not been for some things which have been brought out luring the debate i should not have entered into the discussion at this time on the 24th of last february the president of the united states communicated with congress in the form of a message in which he transmitted the proposed constitution of the state of new mexico and informed us that he had approved the same on the first day of march following this house without division or dissenting vote approved that constitution at that time the proposed constitution of the state of arizona had not reached the capitol but it arrived here later and at the beginning of this session the committee on territories very properly took up the consideration of the question of the approval of the proposed constitutions of these two states the result of their labors is before us in the resolution now under consideration in which it is proposed to admit both territories but submit to the people of each for their consideration at the time of their first state elections certain proposed amendments to their respective constitutions the amendment which the people of new mexico are required to vote upon relates to that portion of their constitution which provides for amendments to that instrument the proposition presented to the people of arizona is an opportunity to eliminate from their constitution if they see fit to do so the provision for the recall of judges both these propositions are in the nature of referendums and both territories are to be admitted as states without regard to how their people vote on the propositions presented the objection to the constitution of new mexico as stated by the majority of the committee is that its provisions for amendment are such as to make amendment difficult and all sorts of sinister and unworthy motives are attributed to those who are responsible for that provision in this condition of affairs it is pertinent to inquire what has occurred since the 1st of march last which has so radically altered the view of the gdntlemen on the other side of the aisle touching the proposed constitution of new mexico at that time from anything i have heard to the contrary that constitution was held to be a most excellent instrument one under which that new commonwealth could very properly be admitted into the union what has come over the spirit of the dreams of the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber since that time there has been some criticism of a certain provision in the constitution of arizona and i am of the opinion as i believe many others are that if it were not for the criticisms that have been made of the provisions of the arizona constitution touching the recall of judges we never would have heard the philippics hurled from the other side of the aisle against the proposed constitution of new mexico but arizonas constitution has been criticized in one particular and having been attacked it became necessary for the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle to present a new mexico roland for the arizona oliver and so for a week we have heard the chamber reverberate with most fervid denunciations of this awful instrument this reactionary constitution of new mexico which on the 1st day of march last according to the vote of the house was an altogether lovely and proper instrument gentlemen on the other side of the chamber are much disturbed in regard to this constitution as to many of its provisions i have not the time to go over those provisions i understand that the gentleman from pennsylvania who preceded me referred to some of them at length but having read that constitution with considerable care it strikes me as being one of the best under which a state has ever proposed to become of the sisterhood of states gentlemen on the other side are particularly disturbed with regard to the provision of the constitution relative to amendmentthat is the provision with regard to amendments to most of the provisions of the constitution what are those provisions first that the legislature shall by twothirds vote propose amendments i think 22 of the states of the union have a similar provision and some 6 or 7 states of the union require threefifths so that more than a majority of the states of the union have practically this same provision with regard to the initiation of constitutional amendments when it comes to the ratification of a constitutional amendment the constitution provides that it shall be by an affirmative majority of the votes cast on the amendment providing that majority is not less than 40 per cent of all the votes cast and in half of the counties and this is the provision that the gentlemen on the other side are particularly disturbed over forgetful that about a third of the states of the union have provisions with regard to the ratification of constitutional amendments which render such ratification much more difficult than this provision of the new mexico constitution i think there are some eight or nine states which require a majority of all of the votes cast at an election for the ratification of a constitutional amendment whereas the proposed constitution of new mexico requires only 40 per cent of all the votes cast the constitutions of iowa and georgia require for the ratification of a constitutional amendment the affirmative vote of a majority of those qualified to vote for members of the general assembly which i assume means an affirmative vote of a majority of all those registered no one can deny that these provisions of the constitutions of states of the union render the amendment of their constitutions much more difficult than the provision of the constitution of new mexico referred to renders that constitution and yet against this provision the gentlemen on the other side have thundered with more eloquence than logic for a week it seems to me it is highly important that the states shall have such constitutional provisions that the fundamental laws can not be amended by a minority vote the gentleman from colorado opened the debate on this resolution and i am reminded of the fact that in his state under a provision by which a constitutional amendment may be adopted by a majority of the votes cast on the question an important constitutional amendment was adopted several years ago by an affiriiative vote of less than 7 per cent of the electors of the state the resolution before us which the democratic majority ask us to support proposes to call upon the people of new mexico to vote on the question as to whether they shall modify their constitutional provision with regard to general amendments so that an amendment may be proposed by a bare majority of the legislature and ratified by a bare majority of those who vote on the question those who have given any attention to that sort of thing know that in the presence of a noisy clamorous and insistent demand even though it be backed by an infinitesimal minority of the people a legislature may finally be worn out and working along the line of least resistance prevailed upon to present an amendment for the ratification of the people which a majority of the members do not approve we also know that it has frequently occurred that amendments thus presented have been adopted as in the case of the amendment i have referred to in colorado by a small minority of the people of course it can be argued that if the proposed amendment is really seriously objectionable the people will take the trouble to vote against it but this does not necessarily follow the indifference that often characterizes a vote on a constitutional amendment is quite as likely to arise from the fact that the evils that may lurk in the amendment are not appreciated as from the fact that the amendment is considered innocuous certainly there is no crying need for an amendment to the fundamental law of any state the necessity for which is not realized by a majority of those who vote at an election personally i am inclined to favor the iowa and georgia provisions which require that a majority of all those qualified to vote shall give their assent to a constitutional amendment before it shall become part of the organic law this is but a logical application of the rule of majorities and those who insist upon what they are pleased to call more liberal provisions with regard to amendments are clamoring not for the rights of the people but for the opportunity of active and possibly illadvised minorities to write their views into the organic law but if the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle were consistent in their demand for the liberalization of the amendment provisions it would be an entirely different matter but consistency which is a jewel shineth not in this report or in the resolution now before us there are objectionable features in the constitution of new mexico touching the amendment of four of the articles of the constitution and this same majority which is so fearful that the people of new mexico shall not have a right by a minority vote to repeal the bill of rights still leaves the matter of amendment of these articles in such form that if the people of new mexico want to grant the franchise to women the better half of mankind if they want to do away with the teaching of alien language in all the schools of the commonwealth they must have the vote of threefourths of the legislature threefourths of the voters and twothirds of the electors in every county of the state and that is the sort of consistency we find in the proposition before us if the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle are honest and sincere in their demand that constitutions shall be easily amended why do they not demand an amendment so that the franchise may be granted to women that the teaching of spanish in the schools may some day be dispensed with and thus a dual civilization and language pass away without compliance with requirements which are practically prohibitory article 7 section 1 of the constitution of new mexico relates to the qualification of electors section 3 relates to the rights of citizenship and section 10 of article 12 provides that the children of spanish descent shall be granted equal privileges in the schools with other children and that separate schools shall not be established for them for reasons which seemed good to them the people of new mexico provided that so far as these articles were concerned the constitutional provision relative to amendments should be practically prohibitive and gentlemen on the other side clamorous in their demand that the people of new mexico shall have the right to amend their fundamental law leave the provisions of amendment of these sections just as written by the people of new mexico ah more than that the gentleman from colorado the other day when i called his attention to the matter said well we did not change that well that would not have been a very good answer if it had been entirely accurate but unfortunately it was not entirely accurate section 8 of article 12 of the constitution provides for the training of teachers in spanish in order that the spanish language may be forever taught in the schools of new mexico and thus an alien population permanently maintained there the people of new mexico were perfectly content with the provision in their constitution to the effect that an amendment proposed to change this section should only be submitted upon the vote of threefourths of the legislature but they were perfectly willing to leave the ratificationof that question to the people on the general proposition of ratification of 40 per cent of the electors in half of 0e couities but the gentlemen on the other side claiming to i so anxious to liberalize this constitution so anxious to give the people of new mexico an opportunity to amend their constitution by a minority have in the case of this particular section of article 12 made it much more difficult to amend in their proposed change than was provided in the constitution adopted and this is the consistent position which the gentlemen on the other side expect us to follow if the constitution of new mexico relative to amendments ought to be amended it ought to be amended in toto and yet in regard to those provisions which are practically prohibitive the gentlemen on the other side have either left them as they were or as in the case of the article that i have referred to they have made it more prohibitive than it was before well i suppose there was some reason for this in the first place the spanishspeaking people of new mexico are not altogether unacquainted with what the democratic party has done to the colored brother in the south and it would not have done for the democratic party to have changed those provisions intended to safeguard the rights of the spanishspeaking people otherwise my friend from colorado could not have made that impassioned appeal in his speech which sounded like a stump speech to a meeting of his spanishspeaking constituents in which he assured them that the democratic p arty did not propose in any way to affect those guaranties which tend to maintain in new mexico a dual citizenship"], [0.028540730476379395,

the matter comes in the same way that it does in respect to the reference of a bill to the house calendar or the union calendar if this bill as introduced into the house was a house calendar bill carrying no appropriation when reported back it would go to the house calendar if however the committee on the judiciary had proposed an amendment to the bill carrying an appropriation that amendmlent would carry the bill to the union calendar oil the other hand if the bill as introduced had carried an appropriation that would carry it to the union calendar nor would a committee amendment to strike out the appropriation take it from the union calendar and refer it to the house calendar either by way of comirttee amendment or by way of original provision in the bill if an appropriation is involved it must go to the union calendar i maintain that the same principle relates to senate bills called up fromi the speakers table that if there is a provision in the house bill which the committee proposes to strike out by way of amendment or if the committee proposes to add by way of amendment a new provision either one of which is substantially different from the provision in the senate bill then the bill can not be taken froml the speakers table the speaker will notice the taking of a senate bill from the speakers table is an exception to the general rule and ought not to be

of the government had been exceeding its expenditures by a large amount the government was collecting more revenue than it needed to meet its fixed charges and the question was what tax should the government reduce in order to prevent a further accumulation our protected interests objected to a reduction of duty on imports and were successful in preventing a reduction of the tariff the internalrevenue tax on tobacco was adopted as the easiest and most satisfactory way of reducing our large and then growing surplus this was the sole reason for the reduction made in this tax at both of these dates it was not because the government or congress regarded the tax as too high it was not because the consumers of tobacco were objecting to the tax it was not because the farmers who raised the tobacco demanded or requested it it was done in each instance solely for the purpose of cutting down the revenue it was cut down for this express purpose and this amounted to a notice to the world that it would be and should be restored whenever the governments needs required no man can complain if the government restores this tax when it should be restored who would complain if the tax of 1883 or 1879 on tobacco were restored and the whole tax on sugar could be removed sugar is a prime necessity tobacco a luxury tobacco is bought by those who desire but who do not need it sugar is a necessity on every mans table the government gets all the tax it levies on tobacco the government gets only 52 cents out of every 1 39 that is exacted of the consumer of sugar on account of tariff 52 cents going to the government and most of the remaining 87 cents going to the sugar trust and our island planters the lion green b raum then commissioner of internal revenue protested against the reduction of the internalrevenue tax on tobacco in a special report to congress after stating the amount of money required by the government and the amount of its revenue he showed that we were collecting from 70 000 000 to 80 000 000 more than we needed and then says it is an old and sound maxim that no more revenue should be raised than is necessary for an economical administ ation of the government and a gradual reduction of the public debt therefore it becomes obvious that a reduction of from seventy to eighty millions in the annual revenues of the country could be safely entered upon and in my judgment such a reduction is urgently called for i respectfully offer some suggestions for your consideration in this regard the great bulk of internalrevenue taxation is deri 7ed from distilled spirits about ninetenths of which are used as a beveragemalt liquors tobacco and cigars these are no articles of necessary consumption but are articles of luxury the taxes upon which are readily paid by the consumers and no one need consume them i am strongly of the opinion that so long as the principle of deriving part of the revenue of the government from internal taxation is retained these articles and the dealers therein are proper subjects for taxation there is no demand on the part of consumers of these products for the remission of the taxes imposed upon them there is no public sentiment calling for their repeal on the contrary the general current of public opinion seems to be in favor of their retention this is a strong argument against the reduction of the tax in 1879 his advice was not heeded and the tax on tobacco was reduced from 24 to 16 cents a pound in the annual report of gen raum for the fiscal year ending june 30 1879 the report bearing date november 24 1879 referring to the reduction of the internalrevenue tax on tobacco in this report he says experience has shown that no material advantage has inured to the consumer of tobacco in the reduction of price by reason of the reduction of the tax what is more unequal and unjust what is more of a pitiable parody on our taxing system than a law that taxes 25cent cigars at 1 2 per cent of its retail price and sugar 36 per cent of its retail price is it not wickedly unfair let us remember when we come to revise these laws that these charwomen who on their knees scrub the floors of our office building and our capitol building who work late at night and early in the morning and perform work of the most menial and laborious character and at a small wage pay 12 times as much tax for every dollars worth of sugar they buy as we pay for every dollars worth of 10cent cigars that we buy would an i clieasn in the intennalrevenue tax injure th farmer one of the arguments that has been raised against increasing the internalrevenue tax on this luxury is that it will injure the farmer who raises it the opponents of the indrease of this taxthose who do not desire the government to obtain any other large source of revenue which will enable congress to reduce the tariffwarn us solemnly and with greatunction that if we raise the tax on tobacco the farmer will be greatly affected if not ruined to one who has not made a study of this question this argument may seem very plausible but in fact nothing is further from the truth history shows us over and over again that a large or small tax on a luxury of this kind has no effect on the price of the raw ingredients used in the production of such luxuries or on the amount consumed the history of tobacco since america was discovered when tobacco came into use shows conclusively that the tax on tobacco has nothing whatever to do with the price paid to the farmer the average price of tobacco on the farm has been quite as high when our internalrevenue tax has been one two three four five and six times as high as our present tax whenever we have made the heaviest reduction in our internalrevenue tax on tobacco the price of tobacco on the farm has not been increased a fraction of a cent in 1879 we took off 8 cents a pound the farm price of tobacco prior to that time was 8 cents per pound did the farmer get this 8 cents that was removed from the internalrevenue tax not at all though the tax removed was equal to the price of the farm product in 1883 we again reduced the internalrevenue tax on tobacco 8 cents per pound the then prevailing price of tobacco on the farm was about 8 cents a pound did this increase the value of the tobacco on the farm not a particle the farmer did not receive one penny advance nor a fraction of a penny advance for his tobacco the average price of tobacco from 1875 to 1883 was 7 7 cents per pound the internalrevenue tax on tobacco for the first four years of this time was 24 cents a pound for the last four years it was 16 cents a pound the average price of tobacco from 1885 to 1895 was 8 cents a pound while the internalrevenue tax on tobacco was only 6 cents a pound as compared with 24 cents and 16 cents a pound from 1879 to 1883 the average price of tobacco from 1895 to 1905 was 7 2 cents a pound with an internalrevenue tax of only 6 cents a pound the farm price was onehalf a cent a pound less than from 1875 to 1883 when the tax was 24 and 16 cents a pound the average price of tobacco on the farm from 1900 to 1905 was 7 1 cents per pound it will be seen that the farm price during these five years was sixtenths of a cent less a pound than it was from 1875 to 1883 when the revenue tax was 24 cents and 16 cents a pound from 1865 to 1872 the tax on tobacco was 32 cents a pound the highest tax ever placed by the united states on tobacco during these years while this tax was in force the average price of tobacco was 9 8 cents per pound on the farm the highest average price in the history of this country except during the war from july 1898 until may 1901 the tax on tobacco was doubled that is to say it was raised from 6 cents to 12 cents a pound in 1901 it was reduced from 12 cents to 9 cents a pound and in 1902 it was restored to the prewar tax of 6 cents a pound the farmer received as large a price during the years the spanishamerican war tax was in force as he did the three years preceding the war or the three years following the war if we compare the prices of tobacco for the years mentioned it will be observed that the farm price of tobacco was as high and even higher when the revenue taxes were the highest we ship our enormous surplus abroad the price of tobacco raised in this country is controlled by the price abroad as is our cotton the price is fixed by the law of supply and demand the tax of 74 85 and 93 cents levied by the countries who consume the major portion of tobacco that we export no more determine the price of the raw article than does our tax of 6 cents a pound"], [0.914500892162323, 0.914500892162323, 0, "i desire to repeat further what i said the other day that when bills are referred to the regularly

complainant and that the giving of notice of the application or the delay incident thereto would probably permit the doing of the act sought to be restrained before notice could be served or hearing had thereon the court or judge may in his discretion issue a temporary restraining order without notice every such order shall be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance shall be forthwith entered

by reference to the bill of complaint or other document the act or acts sought to be restrained and shall be binding only upon the parties to the suit their agents servants employees and attorneys or

the absence of such dispute by any party thereto the protest against the abuse of the injunctive process has become national in its character it is too respectable to be denounced as unreasoning clamor and it is too insistent to be ignored as temporary discontent throughout the country there is a confirmed conviction that the equity powers of the federal judiciary have been employed not exclusively to preserve property from destruction but frequently to compel the settlement of industrial disputes in his annual message to congress submitted december 3 1906 the president recognized the situation in the following language there must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder but there must likewise be no such abuse of the injunctive power as is implied in forbidding laboring men to strive for their own betterment in peaceful and lawful ways nor must the injunction be used merely to aid some big corporation to carry out schemes for its own aggrandizement it must be remembered that a preliminary injunction in a labor case if granted without adequate proofeven when authority can be found to support the conclusions of law upon which it is foundedmay often sittle the dispute between the parties and therefore if improperly granted may do irreparable wrong again on january 31 1908 the same high authority declared in a communication to congress it is all wrong to use the injunction to prevent the entirely proper and legitimate actions of labor organizations in their struggle for industrial betterment or under the guise of protecting property rights unwarrantably to invade the fundamental rights of the individual it is futile to concede as we all do the right and necessity of organized effort on the part of the wage earners and yet by injunctive process to forbid peaceable action to accomplish the lawful objects for which they are organized and upon which their success depends while the recommendations of the executive are not as matter of course to be adopted by the congress they may be accepted in this instance as establishing a widespread dissatisfaction with the practice obtaining in the united states courts this body in house bill 23635 which i have just read undertook to enact legislation to remedy the evils complained of that measure if it shall become effective will make impossible the issuance of injunctions a without reasonable notice to all concerned b without including the names of all persons affected c without abundant indemnity against damage that may be sustained d without specific detail of acts and conduct enjoined by the order these provisions are of general application and encountered but little opposition when they were under discussion in the house but the concluding section 266c relates particularly to the interference of equity courts in labor controversies and provoked elaborate discussion it provides that in such disputes no injunction shall issue unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property or property rights and that these rights must be specifically defined by verified application and it crystallizes into the law the most intelligent opinions of the most authoritative tribunals concerning those things which in the enlightened judgment of this age are permissible to be done by workingmen in a labor disagreement i have the honor to represent on this floor many thousands of wage earners

proper officer on lawful process or upon the affidavit of sone credible person or by information filed by any district attorney that there is reasonable ground to believe that any person has been guilty of such contempt the court or judge thereof or any judge therein sitting may issue a rule requiring the said person so charged to slow cause upon a day certain why he should not be punished therefor which rule together with a copy of the affidavit or information shall be served upon the person charged with sufficient promptness to enable him to prepare for and make return to the order at the time fixed therein if upon or by such return in the judgment of the court the alleged contempt be not sufficiently purged a trial shall be directed at a time and place fixen by the court provided however that if the accused being a natural person fall or refuse to make return to the rule to show cause an attachment may issue against his person to compcl an answer and in case of his continued failure or refusal or if for any reason it be impracticable to dispose of the matter on the return day he may be required to give reasonable bail for his attendance at the trial and his submission to the final judgment of the court where the accused person is a body corporate an attachment for the sequestration of its property may be issued upon like refusal or failure to answer in all cases within the purview of tms act such trial may be by the court or upon demand of the accused by a jury in which latter event the court may impanel a jury from tae jurors then in attendance or the court or the judge thereof in chambers may cause a sufficient number of jurors to be selected and summoned as provided by law to attend at the time and place of trial at which time a jury shall be selected and impaneled as upon a trial for misdemeanor and such trial shall conform as near as may be to the piactlco in criminal cases prosecuted by indictment or upon information 880 f if the accused be found guilty judgment shall be entered accordingly prescribing the punishment either by fine or imprisonment or both in the discretion of the court such fine shall be paid o the united states or to the complainant or other party injured by the act cstituting the contempt or may where more than one is so damaged be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct but ifi no case shall the fine to be paid to the united states exceed in case the accused is a natural person the sum of 1 000 nor shall such imfrisonment exceed the term of six months sac 268 c that the evidence taken upon the trial of any person so accused may be preserved by bill of exceptions and any judgment of conviction may be reviewed upon writ of error in all respects as now provided by law in criminal cases and may be affirmed reversed or modified as justicj may require upon the granting of such writ of error execution of judgment shall be stayed and the accused if thereby sentenced to imprisonment shall be admitted to ball in such reasonable sum as may be required by the court or by any justice or any judge of any district court of the united states sec 268 d that nothing herein contained shall be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ process order rule decree or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of or on behalf of the united states but the same and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced within section 268 a of tils act may be punished in conformity to the usages at law and in equity now prevailing se 268 e that no proceeding for contempt shall be instituted against any person unless begun within one year from the date of the act complained of nor shall any such proceeding be a bar to any criminal prosecution for the same act or acts but nothing herein contained shall affet any proceedings in contempt pending at the time of the passage of this act this measure which is designed to regulate the procedure ii prqsecutlons for contempt must be considered as complementary to 1 r 23635 to which i have just referred controlling the issuance of injunctions if they are both finally incorporated into our system of law it will not be possible in the future for the process of injunction to be invoked and abused in labor controversies as it has been in the past no court then will be authorized to entertain an application for the restraint of men in the adoption of all lawful and peaceable methods to secure a redress of grievances against their employers they may assemble they may engage in discussion they may strike they may persuade their associates to unite with them they may refuse to patronize any party to a disagreement they may provide for strike benefitsin short they may do any and all things to promote the success of their struggle so long as no statute is violated all these rights are guaranteed to workingmen by h r 23635 and no equity court may interpose its power to deny them the bill now under consideration extends the measure of their protection although by omitting to render all indirect contempts triable by jury it is not as comprehensive as the friends of the reform desire in some respects however it is an improvement over the bill i introduced seeking to effectuate the same purpose and for that reason it commands my earnest support it simply provides that if the violation of the injunction be alleged and the act constituting the violation be criminal in it character then the defendant shall be entitled to trial by ai jury of his countrymen the authorities which have been cited by the eminent lawyer who presides over the committee reporting the bill remove all doubt that congress possesses the constitutional power to enact this legislation the remaining question is one of expediency is it necessary is it wise is it approved by high considerations of public policy the practice which we seek to correct is of moderr development and the abuse which we hope to remedy is of recent origin as was said by judge henry clay caldwell one of the ablest of the many able jurists produced by my own state the modern writ of injunction is used for purposes which bear no more resemblance to the uses of the ancient writ of that name than the milky way bears to the sun formerly it was used to conserve the property in dispute between private litigants but in modern times it ias taken the place of the police powers of the state with it the judge not only restrains in punishing the commission of crimes defined by statute but heproceeds to frame a criminal code of his own as extended as he sees proper by which various acts in a suit of law and morals are made criminal such as standing walking or marching on the public highway or talking speaking or preaching and other like acts in proceedings for contempt for an alleged violation of the injunction the judge is the lawmaker the injured party the prosecutor the court and the jury it is not surprising that uniting in himself ll these characters he is commonly able to obtain a conviction the conditions described by judge caldwell are admitted to exist and it is to terminate them that this legislation is necessary i am sure we were all much diverted by the discussion indulged in by the gentleman from illinois and by the supposititious case which he conjured up out of his fertile imagination he advanced the novel notion that no defendant accused of contempt could avail himself of the provisions of this bill unless he first establish his own guilt of a criminal offense i was surprised that a lawyer of his reputation and a legislator of his experience should submit a proposition so essentially unsound and insist upon it with apparent seriousness no difficulty whatever will be encountered in the administration of this measure if it shall be enacted into law where an injunction has issued and a complaint is presented that the order of the court has been violated the complaint itself will of necessity disclose the character of the act constituting the alleged contempt if it is not criminal in its nature the court will proceed to adjudicate the issue if it is criminal in its nature the defendant will be entitled to trial by jury precisely as if he were indicted for the offense and this because his liberty is jeopardized in the result of the proceeding"]], "top_unsure": [[3.635883331298828e-06,
