the national congress of the united states in the last generation so that with a high sense and due appreciation of the convincing and unanswerable arguments that have already been presented against it i am constrained in response to the general demand of my constituents for its defeat to urge my strongest protest against the enactment of this measure that interest is not confined to any one class of individuals but alike to the farmer the mechanic theikrtisan the manufacturer and the business man and all are presenting their prayers and petitions to this honorable body that the safeguards of their progress and prosperity the foundations of their blessings and contentment be notexposed to the ravages of underpaid foreign labor and the degrading effects of foreign competition the year ending in october 1892 has gone down to history noted as being the mostprosperous year in every branch of human activity on every hand were felt the abundance of prosperity and the beneficent results of a tariff that fully protected the american home and the american fireside the farmer was rewarded by full demands for his products the manufacturer was compelled to bend all his energy to supply his trade while the artisan and the mechanic realized their hopes in the value of their labor and incessant opportunity for their skill and workmanship the avenues of commerce were in full operation in every direction widening the fields for the products of the farmer and the manufacturer bringing to every branch of enterprise the fullest compensation for the energv expended and the labor performed on the 8th day of november 1892 it is a matter of regret to all classes of our population at the present time by some mysterious influence or hallucination by a strange commingling of various elements and classes of the body politic having every conceivable theory of governmental policies all united under a democratic platform susceptible of various interpretations as manifested by those most prominent in its authorship by the carelessness of those satisfied with their prosperous condition or their temporary conversion to the glowing predictions and eloquent theories of those students of maxims and not of markets the people decreed that there should be a change in the present tariff constructed upon the lines of protection to american industries and that there should be substituted for it a tariff law formed solely with reference to revenue without consideration for the factory and laborer the farmer and the mechanic from the moment the result of the election on that fatal day became known when its purport and inevitable consdquences to our agricultural and commercial enterprises began to be suspicioned by the people there seemed to be a mighty awakening throughout the domains of our land and we were brought face to face with the full realization of the fears and distrust that would be occasioned by any tinkering or remodelling of the present tariff laws this excusable distrust and uncertainty began to assume serious proportions the manufacturers fearing the evil consequences that might follow a tariff revision not knowing what particular articles would be affected by the changerthe committee on ways and means had not been designateddared not prepare for the supplies of the coming year and were compelled to shorten the time of labor and finally to close their factories the employds being thrown on their own resources were forced to draw their savings from the banks and building association4 or as was largely the case in my district to sacrifice what they had invested in their homes in order to procure the necessities of life widespread consternation was manifest in every corner of the land within a short time after the inauguration of the present administration yet no effort was made to check the impending dangers until after six months commercial desolation and oppression had opened the eyes of the new rulers with the possible exception of an unsuccessful effort to attribute them to the money question particularly the purchase clause of the socalled sherman bill while the great empire state has at times seemed to be on the side of tariff reform in the great political issues in which national questions have been at stake for discussion and determination during the past thirty years let it be said to the credit of the thirtyfourth congressional district of new york which i have the honor to represent that it has always been found in the forefront of the battle bearing aloft the banner of protection to american industries and american homes we have been told that the present condition of affairs has been brought about as the result of legislation enacted by the republican party from which there was no relief except the tedious process of legislation which would wipe out our industries without any hope or promise of any substitutes for them it may be an easy task to hamper or even destroy the industries which have been built up during a generation of unprecedented national prosperity but it will be a most difficult undertaking when once you have them destroyed to build on their ruins and bring about a condition of affairs such as existed prior to november 1892 then every man was at work the product of his labor bought more of the necessities and luxuries of life than ever before known in any part of the worldnow he joins the countless army of the unemployed whose tramp can be heard in deafening volume in all the walks of life and seems to threaten the very foundation of the nation then every furnace and factbry in the land was in full operation furnishing remunerative employment for millions of free prosperous and happy workers whose wages were invested in homes which they were yearly improving and whose lot was shared by faithful and loving wives and the children whom they were bringing up blessed with all the opportunities such as prosperous parents could extend to themnow all the industries are closed or are working on short time and reduced wages and these same workingmen are waiting in vain for the once welcome and neverfailing factory whistle to call them to their daily labor many of these persons whose condition i have endeavored to depict voted for a change in 1892 and they certainly ought to be satisfied to the fullest extent and i believe the prevailing condition of affairs has succeeded in making them so and that they are now thoroughly repentent for their misdeed and are praying to be delivered from their socalled friends the democratic party i will leave to others better prepared than ito discuss the constitutionality of this question of protection to agricultural and manufactured products and fully concur with the unanimous opinion of the republican party and various of the foremost leaders in the democratic ranks that it not only comes within the privileges and rights of this body to enact laws for protection but is as essential to the developmentof our nation as any other measure that we will ever be called upon to consider when i recall that this principle is and has been sustained by state and national courts when i see here and there many of their strong free traders rising and earnestly endeavoring to have some particular products of their own districts protected i am more firmly convinced of its justice and necessity mr chairmani stand on no selfish grounds on this question if i ask for the retention of the duties on any articles produced in my district or state i am equally earnest and cheerful in granting protection to every other congressional district in the union standing on the broad principle of protection toall i view with contempt the endeavors of those advocating so strenuously the principles of free trade for the entire nation except in the product of some article largely the staple of their own districts i heartily approve of protection to the iron and coal industries of alabama kentucky pennsylvania and west virginia the fruitgrowers of the pacific coast the lumber grown upon the shores of the placid waters of pugetsound throughout the north and the great northwest to the lead ores of the rockies and the cascades and of missouri to the woolgrowers of texas as well as montana and ohio to the sugar producers of louisiana vermont nebraska and the dakotas to the manufacturers throughout the entire country and to the agriculturist wherever he may be found within the bounds of the nation i am narrowed by no sectional feelings and would spread the beneficent results of protection to the whole union these are my sentiments and convictions relative to this great question and with this statement i may be pardoned if i enter mostly into the merits of the argument as it affects my own district it is nearly evenly divided between its agriculturhl and manufacturing interests i hold in my hand a pocketknife manufactured in my district it is the product of one of the many institutions of manufacture that sprang up all over the land contemporaneous with the passage of the mcinley bill i am advised by those who are judges of this class of goods that its quality and make are inferior to none the manufacturers of this knowing its superior quality and usefulness have named it the major mckinley knife and its blade bears his name as a just tribute to the wise policy of this economic measure this industry located at little valley n y furnished employment for many laborers who were consumers for the surrounding farmers and the merchants of the town it is proposed by the measure pending our consideration to exterminate this industry by reducing the duty on this class of goods to 45 per cent ad valorem and thus transfer the manufacture to other lands i can not

after the very full explanations that have been made by my colleagues on the committee which can not have failed to impress themselves upon the members of the house i feel it necessary now to touch only one point involved in the original elements of discussion that is called to my attention by inquiries put to my friend from alabama whose attention i now crave that related to the question whether or not this cost of street improvement was not assessed against the abutting propertyowners and if so it should not also have been taxed in part against the railroad company i ask the attention of the house to this point the doing of this work began more than twenty ago it began in 1871 and was completed in 1875 at that time there was here in this district a different form of government from that which we now have a territorial form of government and the streetimprovement work was managed by a board of public works now back in 1871 the territorial legislature voted an appropriation of 4 000 000 to the board of public works with mr hepherd at its head for the purposes of street improvements and it was under that legislation that this pavement was laid as has been stated here at that time this railroad companys line extended from seventeenth street to the capitol and it is affirmatively stated in the pleadings in the record which we have heard discussed today that the railroad company had paved according to the provisions of its charter and kept that pavement in repair the board of public works under the authority which it then held took possession of and paved those streets entirely and how did they assess the cost they assessed it as the laws then directed and required not against the railroad company but onethird against the abutting propertyholdersonesixth one ach sideand twothirds against the district it was not contended by mr shepherds board or the territorial government that this railroad company was liable for that work there was no attempt made by that government which did this work to tax the railroad company for it had no authority to but it assessed this tax onethird against the abutting propertyholdersonesixth on each sideand twothirds against the district then what in 1878 the congress changed the form of government and in the act of 1878 extinguishing the territorial form and establishing here the commissioners form of government which now exists remitted the assessments against the abutting propertyowners who had not paid but affirm2d the validity of the assessment in 1879 by a supplemental act of congress it was enacted that the taxes having bcen remitted against those who had not paid therefore those abutting propertyowners who had paid should have their money paid back and the act of 1879 gave to the propertyowners who had paid under that taxation their money back in the form of rebate certificates therefore it was by act of congress of 1878 and 1879 that the taxes which had been assessed by the board of public control rightfully and according to law were remitted to the propertyowners against whom they had been assessed and the whole burden put upon the district of columbia that was years after the work had been done some of it and it was not until two years afterward in 1880 that the succeeding form of government sought to make a claim against the railroad company for that which had been done by their predecessors the territorial government which had no right to tax the railroad company and had not asserted any such right but had in pursuance of law assessed the cost against the district and the property owners which assessment as before stated congress by acts passed in 1878 and 1879 remitted putting the burden upon the district those are the facts of the case now that is the only point connected with that original controversy that i intend now to discuss"], [0.024346720427274704, 0.024346720427274704, 0, "certainly there was an attack made upon the

investigation forwe believe that it can be made a very important industry it may be of interest to yourreaders tolearn the progress of developments in theimportant lnvestigationsin flax and hemp culture in wbatcom county which 1 have been engagedan for the past two years as i have fully demonstrated the perfect adaptability of our puget sound climate to the profitable cultivation of both flax and hemp of the highest quality it is a matter of importance tocompare the yield and profitof the flax crop raised in whatcom county with the average results in europe a matter upon which i am now in a position to express in definite figures having personally weighed and measured some of the crops of flax raised in the course of this investigation and having found them to surpass my most sanguine expectatiens it must be remembered that my investigations have been carried on with thick seeding for the sake of securing a fine quality of fiber regardless of the yield of seed in fact in the north of ireland in thegreat flax district around belfast the yield of seed amounts to so little that it is entirely ignored and in many cases no attempt is made to save it being left to rot in the ponds consequently the yield of such in my investigations in no way represents the yield of seed that could be obtained in this climate by thin seeding and making the seed product the primary object as in other states of the union in the flaxgrowing states where large tracts of flax are planted for seed the straw is frequently burned up or wasted as of little value while on puget sound the straw is of so fine a quality that the seed is of little consequence compared with it yet even then our puget sound grown seed surpasses that grown in any other part of the world both in yield and quality in europe with the same heavy seeding that i used of 1 to 2 bushels per acre the yield of seed averages from 2 to 5 bushels per acre while in my experiments it ran from 9 to 17 bushels per acre and had my seeding been with a view to grow as large a crop of seed as possible regardless of straw i have no hesitation in saying that over 20 bushels of seed would have been secured while 11 to 14 bushels only is the average for good crops in dakota minnesota and illinois it is not however to the seed yield of flax that the puget sound grower need confine his efforts the value of the fiber so far overshadowing it that it need only be considered a side issue or a waste product although of greatvalue in itself the yield of flax straw in the best crops in europe amounts to from 1 to lj tons per acre only rarely reaching 2 tons while the straw grown for me the past season ran from 21 to 4 tons per acre a yield that must be regarded as almost phenomenal and hardly would be believed in europe or the eastern states to enable your readers to realize the enormous profit to be derived from the development of the flax industry in whatcom county i will reduce the above showing to figures based upon actual working results in european flax districts in charles richard dodges official report to the department of agriculture in 1890 on his return from europe where he had been sent as special agent of the department fiber investigation page 23 he says if the straw is properly rotted and of fair length the yield of clean fiber will amount to 25 per cent good irish has given 30 per cent and belgian 33 per cent it will be noted that length of straw is an important element and although our puget sound straw is both longer and stronger than the european i will take the lowest rate as a
