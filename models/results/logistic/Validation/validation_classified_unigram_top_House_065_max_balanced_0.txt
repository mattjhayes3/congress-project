under these circumstances increased production can hardly be expected there should have been universal price fixing or no price fixing the food administrator has the same authority to fix prices cn corn and farm implements as ol wheat and pork why has he not done so i tried to find out for that purpose i addressed a letter to both the secretary of agriculture and the food administrator the one addressed to the secretary of agriculture reads section 1 of the act of august 10 1917 commonly called the food bill defines the word necessaries as embracing foods feeds fuel including fuel oil and natural gas fertilizer and fertilzer ingredients tools utensils implements machinery and equipment required for the actual production of foods feeds etc section 5 of the same act authorized the president from time to time whenever he found it essential to license the importation manufacture storage mining or distribution of any necessaries under these provisions of the food bill the price of the 1917 wheat crop and the price of meat was fixed the bill did not confer specific authority to fix the price of any article the iood administrator licensed the elevators one of the provisions of the license was that no more than a specified price should be paid for wheat if the elevator violated that regulation its license was revoked and it went out of business the food administrator also licensed the packing houses and one of the regulations of the license was that a price not exceeding 15 cents per pound should be paid for hogs if the packer paid more his packing house was closed the farmers of the country have not complained at this exercise of authority in fixing the price of their productswheat and meat they have wondered however why the authority to fix the price on tools utensils implements machinery and equipment required for the actual production of foods feeds and fuel has not been exercised and the price of these articles fixed so that they can continue to produce wheat and raise hogs without becoming bankrupt harness plows mowers wagons farm laborpractically everything required for the production of wheat and hogshas increased in price from 200 to 300 and in some cases 400 per cent the farmer has had the price of is products fixed but he has been compelled to pay two three and four times the normal price of everything he used in nmaking possible that production the president pointed out this injustice to the farmer in his address to the congress delivered december 4 last lie said the farmers for example complain with a great deal of justice that while the regulations of food prices restrict their incomes no restraints are placed on the prices of most of the things they must themselves purchase at this time when an increased production is so necessary and when your department is appealing to the farmer to increase the production do you not think it would be wise to remove this just conmplaint by fixing a fair price on those articles required for the actual production of foods and feeds and which the farmers are compelled to purchase i am convinced that no other action you could take would quite so hearten the farmers and stimulate them to increased effort if price fixing on farm products is continued and the farmer is left to the tender mercies of the profiteer in his purchases i greatly fear it will result in discouragement and the consequent reduction of production of farm products i take it for granted that the authority conferred in the food bill is ample if exercised to take care of the situation i have described otherwise i feel sure you would have already suggested to congress the necessity of conferring additional authority congress has always stood ready to give you all the authority necessary and had additional power been requested it would have been granted for the asking in conclusion may i ask if the farmers can hope for any relief from the extortionate prices they have been and are being compelled to pay for tools utensils implements machinery and equipment required for the actual production of foods feeds etc i will thank you for the courtesy of an early reply though the letter was written on the 23d day of february the secretary has not yet replied for that reason i am unable to state tle secretarys position on the matter of price fixing a letter dated january 31 of this year addressed to mr ed hockaday kingfisher okla and signed by arnold p yerkes assistant agriculturist i presume represents the views of the department it reads your letter of january 1 addressed to mr victor murdock care federal trade commission has been referred to this office for reply 17owever the question of prices for farm machinery is one over wihich this department has no jurisdiction whatever syou of course realize that the price of raw material is only one item which is involved in figuring the cost of producing any machine the cost of labor is also a large item and this has increased tremendously the price for fuel and other supplies necessary have also increased greatly it is not meant by this to defend the prices which you mqntlon but merely to call your attention to the fact that it is not fair tq judge the cost of production by the cost of raw materials on the whole while farm machinery has advanced tremendously d1uring the past few years it has not increased proportionately with the price which the farmer is receiving for his products this you can easily prove to your own satisfaction by taking the price of any of the staple farm products for the past three or four years and figuring the number of bushels of corn or other crops it required to purchase any machine today it actually takes fewer bushels of corn or wheat to purchase a plow corn planter or any other machine than it did three years ago or in fact for several years past looking at the matter from this standpoint the prices do not seem out of proportion however if you still feel that some other action is necessary in the matter it is the writers opinion that you should take it up with the legislators for as above stated this department has no authority in the matter i judge from this letter that the department of agriculture believes that tile prices which the farmer is compelled to pay is not out of proportion to the prices he receives on the same day i addressed a letter to mr hoover i said section 1 of the act of august 10 1917 commonly called the food bill defines the word necessaries as embracing foods feeds fuel including fuel oil and natural gas fertilizer and fertilizer ingredients tools utensils implements machinery and equipment required for the actual production of foods feeds etc section 5 of the same act authorized the president from time to time whenever lie found it essential to license importation imanufactue storage mining or distribution of any necessaries under these provisions of the food bill the price of the 1917 wheat crop and the price of meat was fixed the bill did not specilically authorize the fixing of the price of any article the food administrator licensed the elevators and one of the provisions of the license was that the elevator should not pay more than a fixed price for wheat if the elevator violated that regulation its license was revoked and it was no longer in business the food administrator licensed the packing houses and one of the regulations was that not exceeding 15 cents per pound should be paid for swine if the packer paid more than 15 cents for hogs his packing establishment was closed the farmers of the country have not complained at this exercise of authority in fixing the price on two of their productswheat and pork they have wondered however why a price has not been fixed on the manufactured products of their wheatshorts and branand why a price has not been fixed on corn and its productsmeal etcand why a price has not been fixed on oats and rye and barley the food administrator has the same authority to fix a price on llese products as lie had to lix a price on wheat and pork prices on these articles could have been fixed in tie same way the failure to fix prices on these products has resulted in my state in practically the complete destruction of the livestock industry bran is selling to the farmer at 52 40 per ton the farmer is paying from 1 75 to 2 per bushel for corn feeding 13 bushels of 2 corn to produce 100 pounds of pork and selling that pork at 15 cents per pound is not a very profitable business and the same is true of feeding s 2 40 per ton bran the food bill confers ample authority to protect the farmer from the conscienceless greed of a lot of profiteers i am convinced that one of two courses must be pursued the law of supply and demand must be permitted to control and govern when applied to what the farmer sells if it is to be applied to what the farmer is required to purchase may i ask ii conclusion if any action is contemplated looking to the fixing of prices on what the farnier is compelled to purchase will you be kind enough to reply at your earliest convenience to this letter mr hoover replied under date of february 26 i have your letter of february 23 1918 i believe that you have somewhat misunderstood th power conferred by the foodcontrol act in regard to the fixing of prices and the method by which the price of wheat has been stabilized the foodcontrol act does not authorize the fixing of a price even by regulations issued tinder the license system no regulation has ever een issued prescribing the price which elevators must pay for wheat nor has any license ever been revoked because of the price paid for wheat tie result accomplished was made possible only because of the power to purchasa wheat and to enter into voluntary agreements couferred by the foodcontrol act in regard to hogs no regula{ions have been issued forbidding the packers to pay more than 15 cents per pound nor has any packing establishment ever been closed because of the payment of a higher price the price of hogs has in fact averaged more than 16 1 cents per pound during the past three months i inclose herewith a imphlet showing what has been done in the matter of hogs in order to assist the producer you will see from this explanation that the food administrator has no authority to stabilize time price of corn and other grains i can scarcely believe that the price of corn is as high as 2 for the average price paid at country stations in nebraska for instance during the last week has been 1 10 to 1 30 pet bushel in regard to the price of bran our chief difficulty has been to prevent the jobbers and retailers from running tip the price to meet the very high prices of olher feeds as you know we have required all mills to sell bran at not more than 38 per cent of the price pail by thn for wheat and i inclose a copy of the regulations govermnig feed dealers which have been recently issued i have sent a special agent to oklahomna and the southwest 1o investigate the numerous complaints regarding the price of bran and i am very hopeful that we will be able to enforce strictly the regulations as drawn we are somewhat iandicapped in this nmattcr by the absence of control over retailers who are specifically excepted by section 5 of the foodcontrol act from the license provisions if the licensing section does not give him that power what does the last paragraph of his letter mean he says we are somewhat handicapped in this matter by the absence of control over retailers who are specifically excepted by section 5 of the foodcontrol act from the license provisions the food bill conferred no authority on mr hoover to fix prices however he has exercised tile authority with reference to certain products desired for oversea shipmentwheat sugar and porkand it was done not only by virtue of authority coinferred by the licensing section but by reason of the fact that he became the purchasing agent for our oversea allies it does not make any difference to the farmer whether the price was marc a 27 fixed by virtae of authority conferred in tie bill or by manipulation outside of the bills provisions the fact is he has been compelled to accept prices for his product that makes it unprolitable to continue its production mr hioover does not tesire to fix the price of other articles than those i have mentioned here is anr interview he gave out on the 25th of february to counteract the effect of a published statement that the government might st maximum prices on all the farmers products he said there appears to be a good deal of misinformation circulated among the agricultural communities as to the policy and scope of the food administrator with relation to price fixing i wish to say at once and emphatically that the food administration is not a pricefixing body except with regard to certain commodities which are today dominated by wholly abnormal overseas commerdal relations and the surrounding factors with regard to which are such as to project great dangers both against the farming community and at the same time the consuming community the two commodities under regulations are sugar and wheat with the further exception of cases in which it has intervened purely as a friendly intermediary between organized producers and consumers the food administration has no authority and no desire to fix prices on the products of agriculture this interview discloses mr hoover is aware the farmers are not satisfied with price fixing it was intended to reassure them so there would be no decrease in their activities it wiii perhaps have that effect as applied to every farm product except wheat and pork it is likely to have the opposite effect on these two articlestthe most necessary of all when thie farlner comes to plant he will take into consideration two things first that wheat substitutescorn oats rye arid bar leyare not controlled by fixed prices and second that tley command a price which will make their production more profitable than the production of wheat the farmeu is as patriotic as any of us he is sfeady to do his part a few weeks ago the national red cross officers sent down word that oklahoma would be expected to furnish 100 000 red cross inemnbersin the great drive in the week before christmas when the smoke had cleared away it was found that more than 750 000 had been enrolled this is not only foul times the 1n51151 ber expected but it is the largest number in proportion to tile population that was returned by any state the farmers of oklahoma did it there was a great and almost unfailing response in the towns and cities too but listen to this from one of the head officials in charge of the membership campaign the farmers of oklahoma responded even more nobly than the city people there was a greater membership lroled lip in the country than n the cities in proportion to their relative nonulntion many whole country townships furnished as many meinbers as there were people in tle township and everywnere in the country there was general enthusiasm and interest in the great campaign which means so nlich for the relief of the war sufferers i congratulate the farmers of oklahoma the fact is the farm folks did just what they always do when there is a worthy cause that is properly put before them farm stock and home an agricultural paper published at minneapolis mfinn having a ciroulatlon of 140 000 principally in spring wheat growing statesminesota the dakotas and montanaias compared the value per acre at prices prevailing febsnary 10 1918 at minneapolis taking the average pre10year period yield the average yield with present value per 1cre is wheat 11 9 bushels2 2 50 oats 28 bushels 24 77 flax 8 7 bushels 32 80 barley 21 7 bushels 3 32 r1 ye 14 9 bushels 37 1 corn 28 4 bushels 49 70 the farnlers will be guided when they conie to sow by the profits promised by different wheat substittites the result will be a decreased wheat acreage we are spending billions for ships for aimunition for transports for equipmlent and for trainiig ouri men we are opening wvide the doors of the treasury to every war industry except agriculture would it not be well in the midst of these lavish expenditures to make sure of our food supply here is the wily one of the great papers of great britain views the peril tile doily telegram in its issue friday march 15 1918 among other things said we are approaching the supreme test of the issue which depends on tile merchantmen it may be a maettr for serious consideration by the united states government wlhether it may not give more essentil aid at thils monment by holding back temporarily further reinforcement for their army with a consequent increase ill tile quantity of oceanborne supplies the paper asserts that if american soldiers continue to come over at the present rate tonnage wihich miglt be devoted to food will be utilized fbr military instead of economic purposes and while both soldiers and food are required food is the more urgent matter another important item to be considered is the labor situation wheat is a crop that must be harvested immediately whlen ripe it will not stand in the field for a long period like corn and cotton farmers consider this when they sow the scarcity of farm labor and high prices for that available will make the farmer timid about planting wheat lie is not sure he can harvest high wages paid in warindustrial activities manufacturing munition making lumbering carpentry shipbuilding railroading and many others with immunity from military service has stripped the farm of workers farin laborers receive less pay and no deferred classification agricultural experts tell us 2 000 000 workers have been taken fiom farms in the past year for the army and war works it seems to ine this is a colossal blunder it is impossible to increase production with decreased man power the adininistration of the selective service act has not been satisfactory to the people honorable men with dependents men engaged in producing food on farms that now lie fallow have been taken while men without encumbrance have been left at home personally i know of iany such cases and have repeatedly called them to the attention of the authorities these authorities have uniformly shifted the blame to the local and district exemption boards after nearly running my legs off in an effort to get some relief i finally placed the matter before the provost marshals office il record form so that the people might know where the blame belongs on february 23 1918 i addressed a letter to gen crowder as follows i desire to emphasize what i said to yon yesterday regarding the labor situation as it affects the farner and farming industry i regard tile classification given farm laborers as unfair and believe if it is per mittesd to stand will shortly result in a paralysis of the farming industry farm laborers without dependents unless graduates of an agricultural college are classed as nonexpert laborers it may be said anyone can break a furrow but running a furrow is not all there is to farming every farmer must also be a business man and a small stock raiser he must possess if successful unusual intelligence along many lines hie must know live stock their habits their dispositions the diseases that commonly affect them he must know how to care for them how to feed them with the least possible loss and tile greatest economy they must be kept and raised on the farm at the same time the crops are planted grown and harvested the crops must be so diversified as to produce a yield and at the same time they must mature at different periods so that the live stockthe hogs cattle horses and sheepcan be cared for a successful farmer must not only possess great industry and high intelligence but lie must also be a good business man if he avoid bankruptcy ie must kno v how and when to plant how to cultivate and the proper time and method of harvesiing he must also know what to rio with his yield whether to sell to bold for future market or to feed and dispose of the same in live stock this knowledge can not be acquired overnt lt it accumulates slowly and as the result of long years of training you can not nike a farmer out of a doctor lawyer baker nerc halut bank clerk store clerk a railroader a carpenter a psine a factory worker or a day laborer by waiving a wand and repatlng the words presto chance a laige per cent of the persons followiig these different occupations could not stand the physical strain the hours of labor aid the exposure required of the farmer and practically all of them would be compelled to lewn the manifold and changing labors of the farm so oben a farm laborer is classified as nonexpert and sent to the trenches lie leaves a vacant place on the farm that is impossible to be filled when the laborer on tie ralroad in the factory where guls and ammunition are made in the factory where clothes are cut and shaped in the forest where the timber for ships and aeroplanes is cut in the yards where the rivets are driven in the ships aeroplanes motors freight and passenger cars is classified as expert and exempted from military service a situation is produced which necessarily draws the farm laborer away from the farm the farm laborer call by changing is occupation change also his classification from that of a nontxpert laborer subject to military duty to that of an exprt laborer exempted from military duty the proferred classiflcation together with higher wages paid in the factory and ilop over that received oti the felrn has already depicted the farms of their laborers and brought abouta situation which presents a serious national mnace the farmers are not asking to be exempted from militaiy service ihey are quite willing to bear their full share of the burdens of this walr tt is the duty however of those in command to look ahead and see that tile farms are not stripped of their laborers bullets without bread will not win this war i do not think the laborer on the farm should fe preferred over any other class of labor at the same time i do mot think it fair nor in the interest of the public that lie be discriminated against i think the class of work lie is performing is quite as important to the success of our armns as the labor perfonmed by those engaged in any other industry if available i would be glad to have a statistical report showing from what occupations the soldiers already called have come tile per cent from each and particularly would i like to have this information as it affects my home state oklahoma on march 7 lie replied in response to your letter of february 23 permit me to say that your analysis of the agricultural situation as affected by the selectiveservice law ias lad careful consideration with reference to the work of the district boards of your state in classifying farm laborers the attention of the district boards has been invited through tie adjutant general of the state to the fact that the definition of skilled labor is not to be restricted to graduates of agricultural schools or to those who have scientific or highly technical knowledge the adjustment of the labor supply on our farms as related to thle necessities attendant upon the enrollment of oemr amy is the more difficult because of the fact that before the enactment of the selectiveservice law the trend of labor was away from the farms the sclectivescrvice act and tw presidential regulations issued pursuant thereto have placed the problem of relief from military service in respect of industrial and agricultural workers primarily in tie hands of the district boards the rules for deferred classification have been carefully worked out with a view to providing a degree of protectjon t158 for agriciltural interests coextensive with that provided other industries and it is believed that the district boards in general especially in agricultural regions have keen interest in the maintenance of the farmlabor supply however in farming communities it can not be expected that quotas can be raised without interference with farm labor which in individual instances may seem severe as you are doubtless aware a bill is pending before congress which will authorize the granting of furloughs for agricultural workers already in the service for their temporary return to the farms if this legislation is enacted it may afford a considerable degree of relief to many farmers in your letter you requested statistics showing the occupations from which drafted men have been taken permit me to invite your attention to the report of the provost marshal general to the secretary of war on the first draft which gives many statistics on page no 62 of this report you will find a chapter headed industrial necessity as a ground for discharge the tables there given will throw much light on the operation of the first draft in respect of agriculture it is interesting to note the relatively small inroad made on agriculture as shown by these figures it is hoped that this will give you the information desired he continues to place the responsibility for errors on the local and district boards the tragic part is they continue taking the farmers last week in one county in my district 16 out of 19 called were farmer boys if this is continued it does not promise increased food production the committee on agriculture has also reported a bill authorizing the food administrator to restrict the consumption of food in hotels and public eating houses and to prohibit the use of foods in the manufacture of nonessentials and so forth i doubt if it will assist to any appreciable extent in solving food difficulties i shall however gladly support those provisions desired by the administration there is one provision however to which i wish to direct your attention it is the clause giving the food administrator power to ration it reads e prescribing the more equable and economic distribution of foodstuffs and feeds by limiting and regulating the sale purchase and distribution by any manufacturer or person engaged in the business of distributing foodstuffs feeds or materials or equipment necessary for the production manufacture or preservation of foodstuffs or feed provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any farmer or gardener including livestock farmers with respect to the products of any farm garden or other land owned leased or cultivated by him the proviso excepting any farmer or gardener including livestock farmers with respect to the products of any farm garden or other land owned leased or cultivated by him makes it possible for one who can deal direct with the farmer gardener and livestock raiser to evade the law the bill will not affect the rich who can purchase direct from the producer the authority conferred is unlimited he may regulate the sale purchase and distribution by any manufacturer or person engaged in the business of distributing foodstuffs feeds or materials or equipment necessary for the production manufacture or preservation of foodstuffs or feeds if the food administrator can limit the amount of sugar salt or any other food the retailer can sell and the amount a person can purchase lie can ration every man woman and child in the country i do not believe it necessary or wise to enact a rationing statute at this time the effect will not be wholesome if in the future it should become necessary congress will be in session and can act tle president has not asked it mr hoover before the committee said he did not desire such authority rationing has proven a failure wherever tried england france italy and germany so report its enforcement is expensive and irritating it requires an army of petty officers nosing and prying into the kitchen affairs of every household it consumes a large part of the peoples time forcing them in line with bread cards there are two classes of folks who can not be reached by rationing legislation it does not reach them in germanythe producer and the wealthy the producer manages in some way to hold out sufficient for himself and family and the wealthy are able to deal with the producer direct and thus avoid the law the government can not keep a policeman in every farmers door the only classes reached by this legislation are the poor the workers and those unable to sport the luxury of automobiles there is no necessity for such legislation the farmers will produce and produce abundantly if properly encouraged prices that yield a profitable return will stimulate and increase production in this connection it might be well to recall that prices are always high in war times everything is abnormal and prices therefore are out of the ordinary we think prices are high today when we are fighting the war for democracy but they are not so high as in the days vien our forefathers were winning our independence here are a few prices in 1776 meat per pound 1 to 2 rye per bushel 30 molasses per gallon 12 butterine per pound 3 corn per bushel 25 potatoes do 10 flour per pound 5 cheese do 2 sugar do 3 in 1779 sugar sold for 4 per pound in 1780 butter sold for 12 per pound and tea 40 per pound i do not give these figures to justify such prices now and i hope prices will not mount higher as the war proceeds war however is but a manifestation of an unusual upheaval and high prices always follow in its wake if it continues for any considerable time prices will soar far higher than any heretofore known if production is not increased i greatly fear the question will not be so much the price of a loaf but can a loaf be obtained at any price those who

part of the people but by the whole people equitably distributed in england frai ce and italy the people are paying less for flour than the people of the united states where it is produced on the 23d of february 1918 i addressed a letter to mr hoover which in part reads if available i would be glad to be furnished with the following information 1 the price the consumer is required to pay for flour in great britain france and italy on march 1 mr hoover sent me an interoffice memorandum which reads in part as follows in compliance with the request of hon joe b tnomipson in his letter of february
