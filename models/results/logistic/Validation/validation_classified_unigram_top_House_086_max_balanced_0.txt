thorough going over a complete review i only hope that in our deliberations and our recommendations for the amounts to be allowed for the various governmental agencies which are a part of this bill we were as correct in coming to the right conclusions as we were in the hearings if we erred at all we erred on the side of economy for the weight of the budget is heavy this bill calls for a very

recommendation of the bureau of the budget that is quite a cut when you stop and consider the fact that this was supposed to be a very tight budget this year that the president submitted to the
