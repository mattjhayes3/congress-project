been written and which has engaged the earnest attention of the greatest thinkers for ages but as the representative here of an agricultural people the prices of whose products are fixed in foreign freetiade markets and who are not in competition with importers and who are therefore not benefited by a protective tariff but who on the contrary are taxed by its provisions to help other people make a living and what is worse to help other people make fortunes i desire to protest against a measure so anjust and one that in the judgment of the greatest teachers of political science is not only violative of the spirit of the constitution but violative of sound morality in any system of tanation the farmers ought to be treated fairly for several reasons n the first place because there are in this country 8 497 000 persons engaged in agriculture twice as many as are employed in manufactures and in all the mechanical arts combined second because they have 18 000 000 000 invested in farms which are constantly decreasing in value under the protective system from which they receive no benefit and of which they bear far the greater share of the burdens in the next place manufacturers must find a home market for their products among the farmers and it is difficult to understand how you can extend your market by making higher prices when as has been phinted out many farmers are unable now to purchase the fiecessaries of life at present prices impoverish the farmers and destroy theii business and the fires will go out in every furnace and every mill in this country will close but the greatest reason why farmers should be treated fairly is that agriculture is the only industry that is not protected and the farmers constitute the only class not asking the government to help them they constitute the most conserv ative and perhaps tlhe most patriotic of all classes they are always for the maintenance of law and order in time of peace and are always ready to surrender their lives in defense of their country in time of war they ask for no special favors or privileges but only demand that the government be administered for the general welfare of all classes and not in the interest of the fe at the expense of the toiling masses yet instead of the fair treatment they deserve this bill is an insult to every producer of corn wheat and cotton in the land under the present law agricultural implements of all kinds and bagging and ties for wrapping cotton are on the free list and this is the only protection that farmers can receivethat is to be let alone and not tax the implements of their toil under the proposed law heavy duties are imposed on these articles and if this law passes the farmer can not do a days work for the support of his family withou paying a tax to the manufacturer for the privilege of doing so agriculture manufactures and commerce were declared by thomas jefferson to be the great pillars of our prosperity and he said that these were most thriving when left most to individual enterprise this is true for the very simple reason that you can not help one except at the expense of the others no candid man will deny that protection is intended to and does restrain com merce no candid man will deny that the great agriculitural staples of this countrycotton corn wheat and oatshave never had any of the benefits of protection and in the very nature of things can not because after supplying the home markets a large surplus is produced for export and there are practically no irport of these products the result is that under the protective system that has been enforced since the civil war agriculture is prostrate under the heavy burden imposed for the benefit of manufactures that this is true is conclusively shown by the census reports in 1850 twothirds of the wealth of this country was on the farms in 1889 there was only onefifth invested in farms much has been said about mills being shut down and furnaces stopped while no consideration is given to the loss of billions of dollars in farm values which has been brought about by the financial and taxing policies of this government in what is known as the north atlantic division consisting of maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts rhode sland connecticut new york new jersey and pennsylvania the value of farms in 1870 was 3 159 03d 197 in 1880 it was 2 803 443 402 in 1890 it was 2 539 200 537 a decrease in the value of farms of 619 839 660 in new york alono the value of farms decreased from 1 272 857 766 in 1870 to 968 127 286 in 1890 a decrease in valuation of 304 730 480 in the state of ohio there was a decrease in the valuation of farms during the last decade of 77 466 525 in the south and west which have been greatly developed in the last ten years there has been a vast increase in the acreage and therefore in farm valuations but not a corresponding increase in profits in missouri 70 per cent more was invested in farms in 1890 than in 1880 while the increase in profits was only 5 1er cent in kansas the increase in farm valuations for the same period was 138 per cent while the increaso in the value of farm products was only 80 per cent in texas the increase in farm capital was p2 percent and the increase in profits only 71 per cent in indiana the increase in the value of farms from 1880 to 1890 was 119 543 999 while the decrease in profits was 19 948 820 in illinois for the same period there was an increase in the value of farms of 253 376 007 and a decrease in the profits of 19 221 124 in michigan there was an increase of farm capital of 57 087 499 and a decrease in profits of 7 498 468 in tennessee the increase in farm investments was 35 951 203 and a decrease in profits of 7 882 130 in the entire united states the increase in the value of farms during the same period was 30 per cent while the increase in the profits was only 10 per cent and dr spahr an eminent teacher of political science in columbia university declares that the profits of farming decreased 20 per cent from 1890 to 1895 the same author shows by reports of the bureau of labor of that state that the net profits of the manufacturers in massachusetts for the year 1890 was 12 95 per cent these figures are startling and conclusively show that the impoverishing of the masses and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the great corporations of the country have been steadily progressing for thirty years until as dr spahr declares 2 600 000 000 of property have been taken by taxation from the consumers of the country and given to the capitalists and 1 per cent of the families of the country hold more wealth than the remaining ninetynine if it is true as dr spahr declares that the distribution of wealth is under the direct control of laws for which the national conscience is responsible then there can be no doubt that this deplorable condition of things has been brought about by the vicious system of financial legislation and tax legislation it is pretended that protection is necessary to give american workingmen employment mr mckinley in one of his celebrated veranda speeches said what the american workingman wants is a job that means money to him and the american economist the organ of the american protective league quoting this adds and every american workingman who is now idle shall have a job before the end of the year if congress will pass the kind of protective tariff that will suit the presidentelect this is paternalism of the rankest character it is communism that would satisfy the most extreme german or russian socialist edward bellamy in his wildest dreams would have been delighted with the idea the proposition in its last analysis means that there is a vast army of men who are unemployed because the millionaire manufacturers are unwilling to pay them wages and congress must raise a wage fund by taxing consumers and especially farmers it means to say to mr carnegie employ your laborers and we will tax the agriculturists to pay their wages and then you need not employ an army of pinkerton detectives to coerce them to submit to starvation wages at the muzzle of winchester rifles all over the country there are armies of tramps many of whom as i believe are made tramps because they have been taught by the paternalistic teachings of political demagogues that it is a function of government to make a living for them such a policy destroys the individual energy of its beneficiaries and is degrading to american manhood the idea is happily illustrated by a picture in the american economist in which the government is represented by a great mastiff with the collar of protection around its neck holding in its paws a helpless puppy labeled american industry this is the idea of the function of government promulgated by the american protective tariff league in mississippi where we have no protection and every man has to make a living for himself there are no tramps out of a job except those who come there from manufacturing districts and although we feed them when they ask for bread they will not work no man ever heard of a mississippi tramp standing with his hands in his pockets waiting for a paternal government to give him a job with money in it especially when the money that is in it is obtained by robbing some other honest workingman of the fruits of his toil and i extend a cordial invitation to all honest workingmen who have been turned out of employment by the manufacturers and whose places have been filled by the pauper labor of europe to come down and we will give them honest jobs without asking other people to pay their wages but this paternalistic doctrine that it is the function of government to furnish people jobs with money in them would be bad enough if a protective tariff would do it but i assert that as far as labor is concerned protection does not protect before elections the most inflammatory appeals are made to workingmen and plausible arguments are used to convince them that government can and ought to take care of them by protection this is the argument the united states has protection england has free trade wages are higher in the united states than in england therefore wages are made higher by protection volumes of statistics are published to support this proposition statistics are very good evidence but wrong conclusions are sometimes drawn from them as an illustration of this the hon henry cabot lodge in an article published in a recent number of the north american review entitled meaning of the votes shows by his statistics that those states which have the greatest percentage of illiteracy voted for mr bryan in the last election and therefore concludes that many of those who voted for mr bryan have not had the advantage of public schools and have not been taught how to vote intelligently mr lodges statistics were all right but his conclusions were wrong the great mistake he made was that in those states where the percentage of illiteracy was greatest the illiterate voters were all for mckinley and the intelligent voters who were competent to be instructed by the great campaign of education with a few honorable exceptions were for bryan those states were carried for bryan not because of their illiteracy but in spite of it so the fact that wages are higher in the united states than in england does not prove that protection is the cause of it while wages are one and onehalf times higher here than in freetrade england they are three times higher here than in european countries which have protective tariff wages are higher now in england under free trade than when they had protection wages were much higher in america in colonial days than in england under protection wages have always been much higher in some states of the union than in others as dr spahr well says common observation is more trustworthy than statistics of the most unprejudiced experts and common observation shows that labor does not share in the benefits of protection else why the various labor unions in all the manufacturing districts organized to protect themselves and why the numerous strikes among the employees of manufacturers which occurred even while the mckinley law was in force and which were simply a rebellion of slaves against the tyranny and injustice of their masters who invariably supplant the strikers by employing pauper foreign labor this condition of things has continued until as an economist of repute in writing of the new england factories in the february number of scribners monthly says the american farmers daughter who worked in cotton mills fifty years ago has been almost wholly displaced by women of foreign birth all representing the lowest types the object of protection is confessedly to enable manufacturers to sell their products at higher prices not in foreign markets but in home markets in foreign markets if freetrade markets they compete with the world and must sell at freetrade prices if they sell in markets protected by a high tariff they must themselves pay the tariff instead of reaping its benefits so that all the increased costs which protection imposes is borne by the home consumer and one class of our people are benefited at the expense of another class instead of at the expense of foreigners protection not only enables the manufacturer to exact from the home producer a greater price for his products but it enables him to pay freight on goods to foreign markets and sell them in competition with the world because the home consumer pays the costs in other words it enables him to sell at higher prices in home markets and lower prices in foreign markets steel rails have been shipped from this country to japan for 23 per ton when the price to americans at the mills was 29 per ton thus we are taxed to help the japanese to build railroads agricultural implements are shipped to mexico and sold at a lower price than to american farmers and thus the american farmer is forced by law to help the mexicans pay for their farming implements the radical school of protectionists favors a tariff that stops the importation of foreign goods altogether here is another picture illustrating the idea in the american economist of january 1 representing mckinley locking the ports of entry and underneath is the order shut the gate this policy instead of raising revenue destroys it and the only object is to raise prices in opening the canvass last fall in ohio the distinguished gentleman who is now the secretary of state declared that that was the best dollar which had the greatest purchasing power taking this as the keynote orators went everywhere warning the people against a policy that would put prices up and make the consumer pay more for what he buys and now come these same gentlemen and declare that as to everything their constituents manufacture and sell a dollar has too much purchasing power and that prices obtainable under natural laws of trade are not remunerative and the committee on ways and means have spent the entire winter in devising ways and means to increase the price of many of the necessaries of life and now an extra session of congress is called to execute the ways and means devised by the committee and whom did this committee invite to help them solve this great problem with which they were wrestling did they invite from the universities the great teachers of political economy who have devoted a lifetime to the study of the great problems of finance and taxation no it was not wisdom they were after they invited representatives of the great corporations and trusts who had furnished the money to carry the election and said to each how muck do we owe you make out your bill and we will make the taxpayers of the country pay you matci 24 the democratic party offered a policy that would insure remunerative prices by natural and economic laws by furnishing a sound currency through the free coinage of gold and silver on equal terms for this they were denounced as repudiators and anarchists by the very men who now want to accomplish the same end by violating all economic law and all laws of justiceby robbing peter to pay paul in conclusion i desire to repel the assumption of its advocates that protection is an american idea and that its opponents are afflicted with anglomania an argument that in order to appeal to the patriotism of our people is glibly made but one that is not consistent in those who assert that america with all its wonderful resources is not able alone to maintain a sound and correct financial policy and that we must submit to the dictation of england in maintaining the gold standard though in the opinion of many of the great leaders of the republican party it will bring wreck and ruin to the country protection is not an american idea it is an old british doctrine which the awakened conscience and enlightened judgment of that people have discarded when adam smith wrote his great book the greatest book that has ever been written on the subject it was a protest against the extreme protective policy then enforced by the british government and that book probably had as much to do in influencing the british people to abandon a policy so much in restraint of trade and to take the shackles of monopoly off of individual energy as uncle toms cabin had in the abolition of another form of slavery no less inhuman than the slavery of millions of socalled free men which exists in this country today and which has been brought about by unjust taxation protection is not an american idea american ideas do not find expression in the resolutions of american protective tariff leagues which have for their object the fostering of monopolies and trusts the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and at the expense of the masses american ideas do not find expression in the platforms of great national political conventions many of whose delegates are the representatives of these great protected interests and many others coming from the south never had an american idea or any other idea but are the pliant tools of their political masters american ideas do not always find expression in the result of national elections and clearly did not in the last presidential election according to the highest republican authority the hon henry cabot lodge in the article to which i have referred shows conclusively that mckinley could not have been elected without the vote of foreignborn citizens he shows that the percentage of foreignborn voters in the mckinley states was 80 99 and that eight southern states voting for bryan have the purest american blood of any section of the union the percentage of foreignborn voters being only 2 13 mr lodges conclusion is that the foreigners voted the republican ticket or to use his own language took a conservative view of things and it is perfectly clear that the socalled american idea of protection was repudiated by americans a great majority of whom voted for bryan nor is this all the great corporations boldly assert that the millions of laborers they employ have no right to vote against their iasters interests they believe in the feudalism of capital as strongly as the people of the middle ages believed in the feudalism of force they assert that their laborers are their retainers and are not competent to think and act for themselves and they assume the right to exercise a sort of paternalism over them and instruct them how to vote if this does not suffice they say to them yofi shall vote as we direct this policy overthrows the old democratic doctrine that all men as citizens are equal and that every citizen is a sovereign there should be no relation of master and servant when it comes to voting the brakeman on the freight train is the equal of the president of the railway company the clerk in the palatial store on broadway is the equal of the princely merchant who employs him the humblest butcher in armours packing house is the equal of that great millionaire freedom of thought and freedom of conscience should be as sacred in politics as in religion coercion and intimidation are as dangerous in one as in the other either will forever destroy free government neither do american ideas always find expression in laws enacted here which are too frequently the fulfillment of promises made to those who furnish the campaign boodle before the holding of the last national republican convention a distinguished republican leader a united states senator is reported as saying if mekinley is nominated we shall have to meet the charge that we fried the fat out of the manufacturers in the last campaign we fried the fat out of them again to secore his nomination that he is continuing to fry the fat to buy his election and as a result lie will pay his political debts wilt a tariff bill framed solely in the interest of manufacturers it may well be asked whether the bill now before the house is the fulfillment of this prophecy the american idea finds its highest and broadest expression in the american constitution which was the deliberate work of the founders of the american union who had rebelled against unjust and oppressive taxation the american idea as to taxation is fully expressed in section 8 of article i of the constitution the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duiies imposts excisesfor what purpose to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general we fare of the united states there is no warrant i~n the constitution except this for congress to lay duties and imposts and the purposes for which these duties are to be levied are clearly definedto pay the debts not debts due manufacturers by the party in power but the debts of the government economically administered the war tariff which was perhaps necessary to provide for the common defense carried with it such immens3e protection that it corrupted parties corrupted government until instead of reforming the tariff on a peace basis and reduc ng the appropriations to an economical basis it has become the avowed policy of a great political party to indulge in the most profligate extravagances in every department of government in order to justify a tax and to levy a tariff on consumers not for the general welfare but forthe welfare of a favored few the advocates of a high tariff have attacked most bitterly the advocates of the free coinage of silver and an income tax on the ground th at these measures would destroy values and were an attack on ca ital be consistent it is as wrong to take from the mouth of labor the bread that it earns as it is to depreciate the stocks and bonds of the millionaire it is as wrong to take from the toilers of the country the fruits of their labor for the benefit of the manufacturers as it is to repudiate the debts of the government we warn you that the conservative forces of this country those who are in favor of upholding the co astitution those who are in favor of protecting life liberty and property must finally prvail the rights of property and the right of every citizen to enjoy the fruit of his toil must be sacredly preserved the government must not be prostituted to the unholy purpose of laying hands on one class of citizens to make rich another c ss if it is true that a great emergency confronts us and that the government is bankrupt then let us obtain relief by stopping extravagance and reducing the appropriations to an economical basis lt us amend the constitution if need be so that an income tax can be imposed on capital and capital will share with labor the burdens of government"],

not improper to submit some remarks on the condition of the masses who have to pay this and all other appropriations on january 20 page 807 of the record the chairman of the ways and means committee said i think it is a serious mistake for the representatives of the south who oesire to improve their economic conditions to forget that there can be no progress except as it is based on an improvement in the standard of living and an improvement in the earnings of the masses he also said the laws which bind the people of this country tend to the gradual in crease of the earnings of the masses upon which prosperitydepends there is no greater economic truth there is no more profound olitical wisdom than the statement that all prosperity must be ased on the uplifting of the masses who produce all the wealth 6f the country this is the very essence of genuine democracy as taught by jefferson democratic policies and the principles enunciated in the chicago platform the greatest platform embodying more political wisdom than any other platform ever proimulgated are all based on the doctrine enunciated by the gentleman from maine i deny however that southern representatives forget this great princile i assert that they as much as any other representatives on this floor strictly adhere to it the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations the other day said i have never yet seen the constitution stand in the way of any representative when it was his interest to get something for his people i say this is not true of southern representatives they have at all times stood here on this floor and pleaded for a strict observance of the constitution as the only guarantee of the rights of the masses and it was a southern representative the distinguished and honored leader of the minority here who was pleading for the constitution when the gentleman from illinois ridiculed it and made the statement which i have quoted i deny that the laws of this country as they exist today tend to the gradual increase of the earnings of the masses i charge the fact to be that under the leadership of the gentleman from maine laws have been enacted that utterly ignore the great principle referred to and instead of tending to bring about a gradual increase of the earnings of the masses tend to the impoverishment of the masses and the enrichment of the few if there should be a gradual increase of the earnings of the masses there is bound to be a decrease in the accumulation of wealth by the few and we would soon have the ideal state of things advocated by thomas jefferson when he said let us found a government where there shall be no extremely rich men and no abjectlypoor ones let us found a government upon the intelligence of the people and the equitable distribution of property instead of this the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few has been progressing within the past thirty year until 3 000 000 000 of property have been taken by taxation from the consumers of the ountry and given to the capitalists and today 1 per cent t includes marine corps of the families of the country hold more wealth than the remaining 99 per cent i it is said that within sixteenth months from october 6 1896 to january 29 1898 the deposits in the new york banks have increased from 372 000 000 to 722 000 000 and the holdings of legaltender money from 109 000 000 to 216 000 000 and that they now hold more than oneeighth of all the money in the country outside of the united states treasury accepting the doctrine of the gentleman from maine that prosperity depends upon the gradual increase of the earnings of the masses on what does he predicate his assertion that there is general prosperity in the country when all the wealth of the country and all the earnings of the masses are being rapidly accumulated in the coffers of a few bankers as the deposits of great corporations and a few men of wealth especially when everybody knows that these vast sums of money so great that the common mind can have no comprehension of their magnitude are themselves the earnings of the masses of which they have been robbed by the most iniquitous system of taxation that ever disgraced a civilized nation and that the moneyed power has become so great its influence in controlling elections and shaping legislation so irresistible that there is not a law on the statute books today relating to the currency of the country or to taxation that is not shaped with direct reference to the policy of making the rich richer and the poor poorer the fact is that the republican party notwithstanding the conservative and patriotic mass of the people have done everything to avoid it has raised the issue of capital against labor money against blood luxury against toil greed against patriotism robbery against honor sentiments have been expressed here and policies advocated by gentlemen distinguished for their high personal character which show a depravity in political conscience and a want of regard for the rights of property and of individuals that is alarming on the 81st of january in discussing the teller resolution providing for the payment of united states bonds at the option of the government in silver the gentleman from pennsylvania referring to the honor of the nation the highest evidence of which and the noblest manifestations of which as he seems to think are the payment of the bonds in gold when demanded said it is more sacred than the traditions and heroisms of our history more sacred than the memories of our heroes more sacred than the graves of our dead and the record shows that there was loud applause on the republican side this is a clear frank and distinct statement of the attitude of the republican party the bondholders instead of the negroes are now the wards of the nation and their right to demand gold is more sacred than the memories of our heroes more sacred than the graves of our dead although it is confessed that under the contract they can be paid in silver although it requires all the earnings of the masses to pay them although no employee of the government is paid in gold and although no citizen can collect a private debt in gold unless the contract provides that it shall be paid in gold from the statements of representatives of capital on this floor one would think there was no patriotism or sense of national honor except with the bondholders suppose in case of war volunteers should be called for to spill money into the treasury instead of to spill blood on the battlefield how many dollars would be obtained suppose instead of conscripting men there should be a confiscation of money where wouldbe the patriotism of the bondholders the shedding of blood in defense of the country is patriotism the lending of money at a high rate of interest and the exacting in payment of two dollars for one is greater patriotism the trouble is the blood shedders never have any money to lend and the money lenders never shed any blood and the shedders of blood have to pay the interest and in the issue raised of money against blood money has much the best of it and now a word about my own section and the agricultural classes whom i have the honor to represent and in speaking of them and their industrial condition i shall not be intimidated by the agents and representatives of corporations on this floor who cry out calamity howlers when anyone undertakes to show the true condition of the masses whose prosperity is based on an improvement of their standard of living and an increase of earnings i once heard a fable illustrating the point a wolf had fastened its fangs in the throat of a lamb and when the lamb began to struggle and bleat the wolf said lie still you infernal calamity howler i am not going to do anything but suck your blood another thing i wish to express the hope that i will not subject my state to be insulted as it was the other day by the gentleman from madisonville ohio who because i told some unpalatable truths about the corporations which he represents controlling elections took a cowardly advantage of his seat on this floor to utter a base slander against the people of mississippi notwithstanding he had enjoyed their generous hospitality which had been extended to him on the idea that he was a gentleman and then he threatened that railroad companies would be revenged on me because i had told the truth the gentleman also tried to excite the prejudices of railroad employees against me by pretending that i said that they had no comprehension of political principles when the gentleman knows if he has any comprehension of english grammar or of the english language that i said nothing of the kind but i want to call the attention of the house and of the country especially to the cotton producers of the south who constitute a large per cent of the masses whose prosperity as the gentleman from maine says depends on a gradual increase of their earnings the gentleman from maine in the speech to which i have already referred made the distinct admission that as 70 per cent of the cotton production of the world is in the united states the production of cotton and of cotton goods can not be protected or benefited by a protective tariff he also said substantially that the manufacture of cotton goods in new england was being ruined by competition from southern mills because in the south factory hands work eleven hours a day while in new england they are allowed to work only ten hours a day everybody who has the slightest knowledge of the facts knows that this is not true and that the great advantages that the manufacturer in the south has over the new england manufacturer are due to other causes which have already been stated on this floor but what i wish to call attention to is the astounding and alarming threat of the gentleman from maine since he has discovered that his pet theory of a protective tariff is a failure to protect new england manufacturers against southern competition by an amendment to the constitution of the united states so as to prevent southern factory hands from working longer than new england factory hands and the gentleman from maine professes to base his advocacy of this measure on a love for humanity and a desire to elevate the standard of living among the laborers of the south let me say to the gentleman that if it is a sincere sympathy with human toil that is moving him all over the great agricultural regions of the south and west men women and children on the farms are working fifteen hours a day for a bare existence many of these people have few of the comforts of life and none of its luxuries the gentleman from maine talks about the low price of cotton being caused by overproduction thousands of these people card spin and weave every yard of cloth they wear because they have no money with which to buy manufactured goods for the reason that 5 cents per pound for cotton does not pay the cost of production and the fall of the price of cotton to 5 cents is not caused by the fact that more cotton is produced than can be consumed the truth is that many people are unable to buy the cotton goods they really need because cotton has fallen to 5 cents it is valuable to the country that the gentleman from maine has distinctly admitted that so far as the cotton industry is concerned a protective tariff is an unjust tax without any benefit an equally important admission the gentleman has made is that the ruin of cotton manufacturers in new england is caused in agreat measure by the rapid decline in the price of cotton he has at last learned and i hope from his candid statement the country will learn that after all the prosperity of all industries depends largely upon the prosperity of the farmers this being true it is important to inquire what has caused the want of prosperity among this class of our people why is there not a gradual increase in the earnings of the agri cultural classes who form 30 per cent of the masses in the first place a protective tariff brings no benefit to them but compels them to pay an enormous tax not only to defray the expenses of the government but to build up other industries the farmer with a family whose home is not worth over 2 000 pays as much tax to the general government as rockefeller who is reputed to be worth over 100 000 000a man who is worth more than the value of all the farms including lands fences and buildings in either of the states of maine new hampshire vermont connecticut delaware south carolina florida alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas washington or oregon the revenues of the government are raised not by a tax on what you have but on what you do not have and what you are obliged to buy there can never be prosperity in this country until this monstrous system of taxation is abolished and the revenues of the government are raised by a tax on property and not on toil there is not a civilized nation on earth except the united states that has not an income tax there never was a political economist of any repute from adan smith to this time who has not advocated an income tax and we want to warn the capitalists of the country that if they do not cease their anarchistic policy of robbing the toilers of the country of their earnings aud come forward like honest men and pay their share of the taxes they may precipitate a conflict that will make them wish they had never been born in the next place i wish to call attention to the fact that it is now the fixed policy of the republican party to fix more firmly to use the language of secretary gage the gold standard that is to say that gold shall be the only money of the country and all other kinds and forms of currency must be based on and redeemed in gold the absurdity of this proposition is emphasized by the fact that all the gold in the country would not more than pay the expense4 of the government for one year that the government does not collect one single cent of its revenues in gold and if its policy to pay all its obligations in gold when demanded is to be continued there is no possible way to obtain it except to buy it by the issuance of bonds and thus perpetuate the power of bondholders to control the administration of government and dictate its financial policy there is absolutely no gold whatever in circulation in the country currency literally means to run around the only running around that gold ever does is to run into the coffers of the banks we want a currency that will call at the hovel of the workingman as well as at the palace of the rich we want a currency that will call on the laborer who works in the field factory and mine as well as on the banker and bondholder in this connection i wish to call your attention to some remarkable utterances of a remarkable man secretary gage instead 6f going through the country learning the wants of the masses and catching his inspiration from them so as to devise a financial policy that would increase their earnings and improve their standard of living has been junketing over the country being banqueted by bankers and imbibing their financial views as well as their wines on the 18th of march at a banquet given by the chamber of commerce at cleveland mr gage said a change in the money whether that change be to one of higher or lower commercial value than that previously in use would cause a universal derangement in prices and a perfect dislocation in the relation of things to each other the next day at a banquet given in his honor by the chamber of commerce at pittsburg he said whatever disturbs general faiths and confidences unsettles commerce and disturbs industry unhappily the disturbing influences are numerous and by their interposition from time to time suffering and ruin results wars and fears of wars crop failures widespread industrial revolts shocks arising from the betrayal of great fiduciary duties these are some of the adverse influences but none of these nor several of them associated are as harmful as the doubts and fears which arise from the apprehension of a radical change in the money standard to which all commodities and all credits stand finally related if the distinguished secretary and his coconspirators had remembered these great truths in 1873 and been guided by them there would today be unexampled prosperity among all classes in this country there was then a change in the money from a lower to a higher commercial value and it did cause a universal derangement in prices and a perfect dislocation in the relations of things to each other the radical change from the double standard of both gold and silver to the single gold standard and the consequent fall of prices which has continued up to this day to such an extent that in spite of the tariff it has brought about the ruin of even the n ew england cotton industry has to use the language of mr gage been more harmful and caused more suffering and ruin than wars crop failures widespread industrial revolt and betrayal of great fiduciary duties and yet the secretary invokes these great principles to fix more firmly the gold standard upon the country having brought about the concentration of all the wealth of the country in the coffers of a few by a disregard and violation of these principles he proposes now by invoking them to perpetuate the ruin he has wrought and fix more firmly the gold standard upon the country he proclaims now as financial wisdom what he heretofore denounced as financial heresy we want to return to the money of the constitution the free coinage of gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 and legaltender notes issued by the government we want a financial system that will foster not the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few but the general distribution of wealth among the masses so that in the language of the gentleman from maine the prosperity of the masses may be promoted by an improvement in the standard of living and an improvement in their earnings gentlemen you can not satisfy the country by calling attention to the prosperity of a favored few the good of the country will not be promoted except by a general prosperity of all it is vicious legislation to promote the prosperity of certain classes at the expense of other classes it is no function of government to help one class of people to make a living or to get rich by taxing the masses i want to deny that there is prejudice among the masses in this country against capital capital and combinations of capital are absolutely necessary to carry on the great industries of this country and the people are perfectly willing to encourage capital in these industries and are perfectly willing for capital to realize a legitimate profit but we want to warn you that you must keep your hands off the united states treasury which is filled by the sweat and toil of the laboring classes alone of the country we want to warn you that this government must be administered by the people and for the people the masses all over this country are not anarchists are not repudiators and ask for nothing but equality of opportunity so that every man may reap the rewards of his own toil this is their inalienable right to which they are entitled by every law of god morality and justice this right they are determined must be respected and if the time ever comes which may god forbid that there must be an irrepressible conflict between capita and labor it will not be precipitated by the toiling masses who now as ever are willing to shed their lifeblood and spend their little fortunes in the service of their country which they love so well"],

of the committee on territories i will say that the gentleman himself and the majority members of his committee as well as the minority members have listened with favor to this propositioi of mine i thank the gentleman i urged it before him and his committee as the chief and unanswerable reason why our territory should be admitted as a state but they were constrained by political considerations to deny us our rights i then told them that i would introduce a bill asking that congress at this time donate to the territory of new mexico for her public schools for her other educational institutions and for her public institutions generally all the lands she would receive if admitted to statehood and we on our part will cheerfully engage that if congress will do this we will take those lands now ip lien of any additional land which might be granted us when the territory is admitted that is the proposition i am here now for this point chiefly not to go over the details of our claim for statehood they are ample they are unanswerable it is no credit to the dominant party in this country trat for political reasons they deny to a quarter of a million of american citizens the boon of selfgoveinment and the right of representation where they are subject to taxation that is the situation that is exactly where we are placed but i know that you are constrained by political considerations to keep us out of the union i know that we have no chance for admission at your hands therefore we ask that we may save for our public schools some of these valuable public lands lately restored to the public domain if you make this donation now we can make the proper selections and get the ben efit of the donation for our public schools our university our agricultural college our school of mines our asylums and all our public institutions the bill which i shall introduceand taking advantage of the opportunity accorded me by my friend from arkansas i am trying to predispose you in favor of that billwill provide briefly that congress now donate to us as a territory exactly the same quantity of lands and for the same purposes that we would have received had we been admitted by this congress into the union and i am perfectly willing that there be added to such an enactment a provision that this donation of land is given in lieu of any further donation that might be made when new mexico shall be admitted to statehood let the government sell the lands as now but reserve the proceeds of sales of lands to settlers in the several allotments to be turned over for their use to our various public institutions in order to show you with what complete injustice if not oppression we have been treated it is necessary for me to show that there can be no objection to the admission of new mexico as a state now on other grounds on those which usually obtain when territories come knocking here for admission i propose to demonstrate on the record that we are entitled to statehood new mexico is entitled to statehood as a legal right under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo article 9 of that treaty provides mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizens of the mexican republic conformably with what is stipulated in the preceding article shall be incorporated into the union of the united states and be admitted at the proper time to be judged of by the congress of the united states to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the united states according to the principles of the constitution and in the meantime shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction according to the constitution itself under the genius of free american institutions and according to the practice of congress heretofore in admitting new states new mexico is entitled to admission the supreme court of the united states has used this language there is certainly no power given by the constitution to the federal government to establish or maintain colonies bordering on the united states or at a distance to be ruled and governed at its own pleasure nor to enlarge its territorial limits in any way except by the admission of new states that ower is plainly given but no power is given to acquire a territory to be held and governed permanently i that character expresident harrison when a senator said in a report upon the admission of dakota the right of the people of a territory of the united states to form a constitution and state government republican in form and be admitted into the union of states is so selfevident that it will not be questioned by any enlightened citizen of any state providing the requisite conditions for admission heretofore recognized have been complied with and exist whatever difference of opinion may prevail as to whether mr harrison was a great president he is at least universally recognized as a great constitutional lawyer now what are the requisite conditions for admission heretofore recognized as to new states only considerations as to the population the wealth or the ability to support a state government and the ability and the willingness to form a state constitution republican in form have heretofore engaged the attention of congress in admitting new states the last consideration as to forming a constitution republican in form is of no moment here because all the enabling acts have imposed the duty upon the executive of determining that the new state has formed a constitution republican in form before he issues his proclamation admitting her to the union according to the last authentic returns new mexico has actually subject to taxation over 36 000 000 under extremely liberal exemption laws and she can not have less than 75 000 000 of property the governor of new mexico in his report to the secretary of the interior for the current year estimates the population of new mexico at 242 000 exclusive of the indians that estimate is based on the vote of something over 36 000 cast in the election of 1896 and the list of registered voters at that election of nearly 50 000 new mexico has a larger population at the present time than any of the states admitted to the union by congress had at the time of such admission except the state of maine t the

1893 several years after admission i find the population of montana set down at 132 159 idaho at 84 835 wyoming at 60 705 and north dakota at 182 719 why this palpable this undeniable discrimination against new mexico it has been said that the population of new mexico is too ignorant for statehood for some years after new mexico became a territory under the laws of the united states it is true she made but slow progress in education the publi6school system had not been inaugurated but in 1871 the great american system of free public schools took root in new mexico and it has made most gratifying progress especially in recent years in 1880 the enrollment of pupils in such schools was 4 755 most of the children still attending the sectarian schools in 1885 the public schools being gradually extended by the taxation of the people the enrollment of the public schools had risen to 10 232 in 1893 such enrollment was 23 151 while at the close of the year 1896 the enrollment showed over 27 000 pupils in the public schools the percentage of illiteracy is rapidly diminishing and parents and children alike are eager for greater educational facilities for the extension and perfection of this great american system of education indeed when it is remembered that this great advance in education has been made without aid from the general government such as the newly created states have had in the munificent endowment of public lands within their respective borders for their publicschool systems and such advance has been made solely by the voluntary taxation of themselves it is a tribute at once to their forbearance and longsuffering under the repeated denial of their just right to statehood and to their determination to beat down even sectional prejudice and shame out even that partisan necessity which for party advantage will perpetrate an illegal an unconstitutional an inexcusable wrong on a quarter of a million of american citizens it has also been said as an excuse for denying us statehood that the people of new mexico are an alien population that taunt can not apply to the immigrant or american population of our territory as it is called in contradistinction to the native or spanishamerican people of new mexico and by immigrant population i do not mean foreigners from across the water or beyond the confines of the united states our percentage of foreignborn is very small i mean the citizens from the other states of the union who have settled in new mexicoand there are not less than 75 000 of them our superintendent of public schools puts it in his report for this year at 90 000these adventurous pioneers who have exactly the same characteristics as the others who haye settled the great west and all of the states in it brave selfreliant hardy they have made the great west and those of them who have settled in new mexico deserve better treatment at the hands of congress but i know this objection is made against the spanishamerican people of new mexico i am proud to stand here as their representative and their defender for in the past they have been unjustly assailed in fact most cruelly misrepresented by members of congress who have sought excuses for what party necessity seemed to demandthe continued exclusion of new mexico from the union but how can a people be said to be foreign who became a part of the united states fifty years ago and who have given faithful and unwavering allqgiance to our flag all of that time every spanishamerican voter in new mexico under the age of 71 years attained his majority under our flag and every spanishamerican in new mexico under the age of 50 years was acttially born on the soil of the united states and under our dominion and in the great civil war though they had been then only a few years a part of the united states they enlisted largely in the army of the union and fought bravely throughout the war more than 8 000 spanishamericans thus enlisted as soldiers more than was furnished by all the then existing territories combined and their bravery and loyalty were never questioned among the names of the officers of these volunteers are found such wellknown spanish americans as these col jos6 maria valdez col diego archuleta col manuel chaves col facundo pino col j francisco chaves col francisco abrea maj jos6 d sena maj rafael chacon maj pedro sanchez and others eqially well known that i will not take the time to mention and yet after that record and thirtythree years after the close of that war and after that long time of effort to educate themselves and their children according to the standard of american civilization when theyapply to congress for their rights under the treaty to enter the union of states they are met with the taunt that they are foreigners if there is any justification for that taunt as applied to them why do we never hear questioned the good citizenship the americanism or the loyalty of their more fortunate kinsmen the spanishamerican citizens of colorado of texas and of california i know one spanishamerican citizen of coloradocasimiro barela of trinidad colo he has been for many years past reelected to every succeeding legislature of the great state of colorado and lately he was elected to the high office of president of the senate of the legislature of that state and not by senators of his own nationality either he is a gentleman of pure spanish descent educated intelligent loyal and there are many casimiro barelas in new mexico some belonging to one and some to the other of the two great political parties the people of new mexico have not only been long deprived of their legal right to admission to statehood under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo not only been deprived of their constitutional right to become a state as that right has been declared by the highest judicial tribunal of this country and by the practice of congress as to the admission of new states in the past as shown by history and declared by expresident harrison but this longsuffering people have been the victims of falsehood and slander as if that could justify the illegal unconstitutional unjust and oppressive course of the republican party toward new mexico the worst of these false charges against the people whom i represent in this great body is contained in the minority report of the committee on the territories of the fiftieth congress made in 1888 that minority report was made only by the republican membetj of the committee and was united in by every republican member of the committee though hon g g symes of colorado joined in such report solely on the ground that the people of new mexico were not then asking statehood thereby silently vindicating the people of new mexico from the charges of the other members of the committee which from his residence among and his intimate acquaintance with the spanishamerican citizens of colorado he was so well fitted to do i quote from house report no 1025 fiftieth congress first session page 42 in part the statement of the minority which was the quotation and adoption in part of the words in a book of one i w h h davis then district attorney of new mexico published in 1856 as follows i regret that i am not able to speak more favorably of the morals of new mexico but in this particular the truth must be told probably there is no other country in the world claiming to be civilized where vice is more prevalent among all classes of the inhabitants their ancestors were governed in this matter by the standard of morality that prevailed in southern europe and along the shores of the mediterranean where morals were never deemed an essential to respectability and good standing in society and laches in this respect had no visible effect on their social position the people of new mexico have inherited all the vices of their ancestors which they have continued to practice to thisday they have never received any moral training in the american sense of the wordandhave been allowed to grow up from infancy to manhood without being tanght that it is wrong to indnlgo in vicious habits tbe standard of female chastity is deplorably low and the virtnous are far outnumbered by the vicious prostitution is carried to a fearfnl extent and it is quite common for pairents to sell their own danghtrs to gratify the inst of the purchaser thus making a profit from their own and their childrens shame itis difficulttoproperlycharacterize sueha shameless libel as that it can not be done in parliamentarylanguage but here in my place in this great legislative body and on my responsibility as a member i denounce that statement and the whole quotation made by the minority from the book as wholly false as wickedly injuriously and recklessly false as evidently written by an irresponsible scribbler who hoped to sell his book by the very exaggeration of his stories or who had been kicked out of some virtuous spanishamerican home in new mexico for conduct unbecoming a gentleman butmyquarrelisnotwiththeauthorofthisbook heis beneath contempt and were my fellowcitizens of new mexico the victims only of the libels of such a man andi uch a book we would net dignify it and him by bringing the subject here my complaint is against the minority members of that committee who dig u the vcious but harmless mouthings of an obscure private indivioan h with his falsehoods had long been buried in oblivion and more than thirty years after they were uttered and after they were forgotten spread them on the public and permanent records of the congress of the united states these reublican members of the fiftieth congress were acting in their igh official capacity and as congressmen were rejecting the just claims of these people to statehood when they adopted and recorded on the public records of congress those cruel charges they are there on that record to be read of all men ever since theywere placed there they have been doing their deadly work to the incalculable injury of this people it is true they were denied and denounced by antono joseph a former delegate in this body from new mexico but he was himself one of that maligned portion of our citizens and it might be thought he was an interested witness i am one of the settlers from the states who went to make a home in new miexico in 1888 that minority dug up fromits grave of oblivion this terrible calumny andogave it renewed and permanent and official publicity and i believe its my duty as it will be the duty of every succeeding delegate from that territory until these peopie finally get justice at the hands of congress i believe it is my duty in my official capacity publicly as the report was made and on the permanent record where the report was placed to deny and denounce that report and the quotation which that reort dignified in 1888 when that report was read in congress phad resided five years in daily contact with the spanishamericans of new m exico and i therefore know personally that the statements that year uttered in congress and the innuendo contained in making that quotation were certainly and most injuriously false i have known the spanishamerican citizens of new mexico for fifteen years and i tell you it is utterly impossible that their mothers and fathers were the moral lepers pictured in that minority report it fills me with hot indignation to contrast those words with what i have learned these good people to be when i remember the christian homes of our spanishamerican citizens the dignity the piety the loving charity and the lofty virtue of their matrons and the modesty the innocence and the purity of their maidens the very stones in the floors of their churches hundreds of years old bear witness against these base charges the dents in the stone floors where they perform and have for hundreds of years performed their daily devotions are silent but eloquent and convincing proof that they are an and lways have been a most devout and christian people it is utterly impossible that a majority of the mothers of such women were ever given over to vice or that their ancestors ever sold ther daughters to lives of shame i the whole quotation from daviss book made by the winority of the committee which i shall not further notice is a tissue of falsehoods and malicious innuendoes such as is rarely penned of a whole race of people in order that i may not do this minority the slightest injustice i will quote certain qualifying expressions used by it in introducing the objectionable quotation above given on page 89 of said reort i find the following while the minority of your committee have felt a hesitancy end delicacy about presenting facts that may appear otherwise than flatterng to the peepl of that territory as well as to the country at large vet believing this territory not now sufficiently advanced in material respects as well as in civilization and education to entitle her people to admission into the union at this time we feel the actual facts relating to the fitness of her pecople for intelligent statehood in so far as we are able to gather them should ho presented to the house again on page 40 the minority uses these words we quote at considerable length from a volume entitled el gringo by w h h davis who for two and a half years prior to 1856i was united states attorney for new mlexico as to the condition of the mexican people in that day and will follow with other and later authorities some of which will present facts indicating the gratifying improvement now taking place among this people also on page 39 we assert most earnestly our desire that this territory may continue upon its present improved course of development which affords ground to believe that in course of time her population by immigration advancement in agriculture manufactures the arts and above all by education and the more general dissemination of knowledge among her peopic wil have attained such condition as to justifyher admission to the union that itcan not reasonably ho anticipated her people will very soon become of eqnal intellignce with those inhabiting other territories now seeking admission into the union a brief glance at her history the social moral intellectual and politieal conditions heretofore and now existing we think fully substantiates the legal right to statehood we have by solemn existing treaty we have the constitutional right the moral and educational advancement requisite the population and wealth greater than has been heretofore required of new states and yet a solid republican vote in the committee on territories in this congress has denied us our just claims why our arguments were not answered our premises were not denied the grounds of our claim were practically admitted but the real reason has been frankly stated yen can not afford to strengthen the representation of the west in the senate you say you must wait until the financial question is settled has been our answer can not afford to strengthen the west in the senate that is a criticism of the constitution of the united states rather than the statement of a valid objection to the admission of a territory to the union it shows either ignorance or a willful disregard of the fact that only representation in the house of representatives is based on an enumeration of the population that representation in the senate is based on the enumeration of the states as independent sovereignties without regard to the population of the respective sovereignties or states that objection has never been urged much less applied in the admission of states heretofore and carried to its logical conclusion it would require new mexico to have when admitted as great a population as new york has now or might have at that time such a contention sows the seeds of discord in our beloved country if new york can complain of colorado in the senate texas can complain of delaware and illinois of rhode island but it is worse yet when you say we must wait until the financial question is settled in other words because we hold political opinions not approved by the party in power we are denied a legal and constitutional right all precedent as to the admission of new states is violated we are held a quarter of a million of american citizens in a condition of semivassalage like a greek satrapy or a roman proconsulate we are subjected to taxation and denied representation a process which oar forefathers thought justified war we are denied the boon of local selfgovernment and our rulers are sent in large part from a distance to rule over us and all for opinions sake i want to record here my detestation of your methods the moneyed oligarchy has prostituted the powers of government to serve its own selfish and avaricious ends for while the republican party is ostensibly performing on the stage we can plainly hear the prompter behind the scenes and the money power or the republican party whichever you will is intolerant tyrannical and unamerican in its treatment of new mexico but that conscienceless thing known as the money power which in england has throttled sympathy for the massacred armenians out of tender consideration for the value of its bonds and which in the united states out of sordid love for its money looks with cold disdain upon the aspirations for liberty of the struggling cubans and sees without a tremor thousands of helpless mothers in that island with their crying babes going by slow starvation to a horrible death that power or the republican party its tool will of course never give new mexico a voice in the government of this country we must wait until constitutional government is restored until the hold on the machinery of government by the unpatriotic selfish avaricious and tyrannical money power is broken and a government by and for the masses of the people is restored we must wait and meantime we refuse to dissemble even were it possible by dissembling to acquire the great boon of full american citizenship we stand by our opinions and boldly avow our steadfast hostility to the republican party of this day and its unconstitutional methods and aims we are for silver and gold both as money we are against the trusts we are heart and soul with a great peoples champion who has declared that the republican party of this day stands fot three pernicious vices 1 foreign control of our primary money 2 nationalbank control of our paper money 3 trust control of the taxing power we are with that great and patriotic man and i am proud to tell you that in my opinion whenever new mexico is admitted to the union she will send men to both branches of congress who will earnestly support every effort to defeat that nefarious scheme of tyranny we shall wait but in the abiding faith that this country will soon be restored to ancient practices under which there was

than i do about those of any other universityi should like to ask them whether any one of them today could pass the entrance examination to that institution though perhaps they may hold its highest graduation degree education is not a test of fitness education at best is but the knowledge of formulated experience the experience itself is the desideratumin the public service this can be obtained by natural aptitude and ability fully as wvel as by the study of books the advocates of this law in urging a life tenure also lose sight of the fact that in this republic we have different conditions from those that prevail under old world monarchies the people of englandthe plain people the common people if you will of europe because they have common people over thereexpect little and receive less from the public servants the appointments come from the higher strata down it is the younger sons of the aristocracy and the dependents of the classes that receive public office there and the masses understanding that fact do not expect much else but insolence at their hands when the lower orders receive courtesy it is in the nature of a favor and not as a right but in the united states it is the glory of this republic that the people own the government that the people are the government that public officials if not the servants are at least the representatives of the people and when you put a lifetenure class in office you remove from that class the necessity for courtesy in dealing with public affairs there is not a lrepresentative on this floor who if he speaks the inward feelings of his heart will not admit that the courtesy of the departmens has vastly decreased since the inauguration of this system why sir from the standpoint of results take for example the chinese empire for unmnbered centuries for countless eons of time that monarchy has had a civil service based upon education and severe examinations yet today behold the condition of chinadismembered the laughter of the orient the booty of the west and shall anyone say that we here today breathing atoms of an hour are not dealing with legislation that may undermine the now solid foundations of this government the establishment of a life tenure in office is the first step in the decay of the republic the socaled merit system in the extension of its abuses means nothing more or less than the

against that statement i put the epigram of the duke of newcastleand i indorse neither authoritythat a man is capable of administering any job he can get but rising higher than either statement it is the pride of the american republic it is the greatest glory of our government that almost any man you meet on the street in any city town or hamlet of the union is capable of being chief magistrate of the united states and if capable of wielding its supreme power certainly fit to administer a subordinate office how long do you think the peopleand i address myself to republicans thoughyouof the
