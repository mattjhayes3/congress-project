do not remember such a case i asked him did you not get 500 for testifying in that case and he said no then i put judge crandall mackey of virginia on the stand and he testified that doctor white had tried to put a lady into an insane asylum when she was sane and had received 500 for it and then doctor white remembered all of the ladys symptoms as it is interesting let me quote for your

cldse of each session and each congress in the form of a brief report on the work of the committee this is because of the general interest throughout the nation in the affairs of the indians two hundred and fortysix house and senate bills were referred to this committee during the two sessions of the sixtyninth congress some of them were duplicates having been introduced in both the house and senate in the same form the full committee was in session on 51 days and subcommittees considered 39 measures holding meetings on 46 days one hundred and eight reports were submitted to the house on bills referred to the committee as is always the case some bills considered in committee were not brought to final conclusion it being felt that the information available was not yet sufficiently complete for action it is also true that many bills are introduced and for various reasons not urged by their sponsors it has been the policy of the committee however to give as full consideration as practicable to all matters presented in the form of bills introduced by members of the house or referred to after having passed the senate where this has apparently not been done it is almost universally true that action has been delayed to allow state delegations to compose differences of opinion or to work out in more detail the necessary information during the sixtyninth congress a total of 77 bills acted upon by this committee became laws of these 43 bills originated in the house and 34 in the senate compare tha number with the fact that considering both public and private bills and resolutions there was a total of but 1 422 enacted into law then it is seen that over 5 per cent of all laws enacted in the sixtyninth congress had to do with indian affairs if we consider

passed the senate at adjournment and 5 had passed the senate but not the house one senate bill was pending in conference and another had been amended in the house and not thereafter acted on in the senate these latter matters will undoubtedly be before the committee again at the beginning of the next congress the house committee on indian affairs while it has the power to report authorization bills does not have the power to make appropriations the appropriations subcommittee headed by mr cramton of michigan which handles the appropriations for the department of the interior has in charge the making of the necessary appropriations for carrying on the work of the bureau of indian affairs the bureau in turn is directly charged with the responsibility of acting as the official guardian of the american indians and has under the law the management of all indian affairs and all matters arising out of indian relations i state this because functions of the committee of which i am chairman have been both misstated and misunderstood under the rules of the house all proposed legislation concerning the relations of the united states with the indians and the indian tribes is referred to this committee the committee has a broad jurisdiction of subjects relating to care education and management of the indians including the care and allotment of their lands it also reports both general and special bills as to claims which are paid out of indian funds its functions however are legislative entirely in the sixtyninth congress the house committee on indian affairs did not have before it any resolution with regard to investigations of the indian bureau the only resolution of that kind introduced in the house was prepared in such form that it went to he committee on rules the resolution was not reported out from that committee a somewhat similar resolution introduced in the senate was referred to a subcommittee of that committee on indian affairs which held hearings but had taken no definite action at the time of adjournment there is however at work a special staff of the institute of government research making a comprehensive general survey of indian affairs it is not created for the purpose of investigating charges it exists for the purpose of studying the indian situation covering the educational industrial and social activities maintained among the indians their personal and their civil rights and the general economic conditions among them the institute for government research is a private organization with headquarters in washington it is nonpolitical and is in no way connected with the government it is organized to make such investigations of governmental activities and cantherefore be expected to submit a report which will be unbiased and of great value the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs taking the initiative have offered any and all cooperation desired this is also true of many others individuals and organizations interested in the welfare of the indians the committee on indian affairs of the house also desires to be of every possible and proper assistance my personal opinion is that every organization and every individual desirous of being of real value in advancing the welfare of the american indian should give such cooperation undoubtedly the report of the institute for government research will contain information and suggestions of the utmost value in connection with a further necessary legislative program the attitude of this committee is that realizing the seriousness of its problem it desires information and suggestions from any honest and unselfish source the special staff of the institute for government research assigned to this study is headed by mr lewis meriam trained as a member of the institutes permanent staff the other members are mr henry roe cloud president of the american indian institute of wichita kans dr edward everett dale head of the department of history of the university of oklahoma dr herbert r edwards medical field secretary of the national tuberculosis association dr f a mckenzie professor of sociology of juniata college pennsylvania founder and organizer of the society of american indians miss mary louise mark professor of social statistics at ohio state university dr william carson ryan professor of education at swarthmore college formerly educational director of the new york evening post and specialist in vocational education in the united states bureau of education dr william j spillman agricultural economist in the united states department of agriculture miss emma duke a statistical expert with experience in child welfare work and mr ray a brown of university of wisconsin legal representative the members of this staff of specialists are to visit practically all of the field units of the indian service the work is already under way in the west and a report is to be expected in about a year of course there are always those who condemn in advance the results of any movement not carried out entirely in accordance with their own ideas the report to be made by the institute of government research is no exception to this rule just as i have been personally criticized because i have not made the committee the vehicle for carrying out prearranged programs by some selfappointed and selfstyled friends of the indians the responsibility in connection with indian affairs is too great and too serious for procedure except along very carefully thought out lines and the chances of doing serious harm through accepting illconsidered proposals is fully as great as the possibility for doing good i am convinced however that there is reason to expect results from this study by the institute which will be of the utmost value to this committee and the congress as well as to the bureau of indian affairs it stands to reason that the indians themselves will be greatly benefited i make this statement because there have been beneficial resuits from every sincere study setting forth facts upon which constructive steps could be taken as an example in 1923 the present secretary of the interior appointed a committee bf 100 distinguished american citizens including indians who had become leaders among their people to act as an advisory council of the department following some months of study a meeting of the council was held in washington on the 12th of december 1923 with 66 members present some very constructive suggestions were made among the accomplishments for example there has resulted a complete reorganization of the indian health service under the trained leadership of a publichealth official there has also come about a reorganization for greater efficiency of the bureau under the leadership of the commissioner himself these reorganization steps have now been worked out and it will be possible to study the beneficial results during the present year this situation convinces me that there will be a spirit of cooperation within the bureau and the department in carrying out other constructive recommendations from the institute for government research still another study will be made during the coming season in connection with the irrigation projects on the indian reservations these irrigation projects are not those initiated by the indian service but the last of them were placed under that supervision about two years ago the situation on these projects from the standpoint of both indians and white settlers has been generally unfortunate there are conflicting interests and in many places the progress of the indians is being hampered by the weight of charges they are in no position to assume i found a very ready spirit of cooperation this winter leading to the appointment of a special commission to study this situation especially as was done recently with regard to government reclamation projects not on indian reservations data pointing to a reasonable solution of this difficult problem will i hope be available when congress convenes in december the board making the study and which will cooperate with the indians a nd other people on the projects consists of ray p teele an agricultural economist detailed by the secretary of agriculture supt porter j preston of the reclamation project at yuma ariz and c a engel supervising engineer of the indian irrigation service with headquarters at blackfoot idaho in closing i am sure it will be interesting to call attention to the fine cooperation which has been received from the committee on appropriations and especially the subcommittee of which mr cramton of michigan is chairman the matter of total appropriations for indian work is in itself indicative of this spirit in this connection i call special attention to the fact that leaving out deficiency bills while over twentysix and a quarter millions of dollars were appropriated by the sixtyseventh congress this was increased to over twentynine and a quarter millions by the sixtyeighth congress and to just under thirty and a quarter millions by the sixtyninth congress of these various amounts the appropriations from tribal funds of the indians themselves averaged about 2 400 000 for each of the three years the indicated increases in the totals being from the public treasury taking health and education as more specific illustrations the steady increase is especially striking again considering the last three congresses it will be interesting to note that the sixtyseventh congress appropriated 10 362 408 36 for educational work that the sixtyeighth congress increased this to 11 815 991 51 and that the sixtyninth congress just closed increased the amount further to 12 895 415 this is without consideration of items contained in the second deficiency which failed of passage for health work among the indians the increase of appropriations has been even more marked the appropriations of the sixtyseventh congress for this purpose were 901 260 those of the sixtyeighth congress 1 597 375 and for the sixtyninth congress the sum amounted to 2 119 920 considerably more than double the similar appropriations of the sixtyseventh congress there were also further items in the second deficiency bill all this points conclusively to the spirit of congress in connection with the work among the indians there is a full recognition of the fact that the health and educational problems in particular have not yet been solved no informed person will claim that they have there is still an appalling situation and a tremendous amount of work to be accomplished but it is equally true that a sincere effort is being made to meet the situation and there is therefore much reason for encouragement may i express the hope that criticism of those in places of responsibility will be constructive in my opinion it is criminal to involve the vital problem of the indians having to do with the lives and welfare of thousands of human beings in politics or in any schemes for personal advantage or aggrandizement marcia 2"], [0.036834716796875, 0.963165283203125, 1, "the auditors report for june 21 1920 shows an allowance of 120 to mrs

and to be constant observers of anythingbe it a physical thing or a mental thing or a combination of bothwhich has an influence upon our people and upon their welfare material or spiritual we of the congress more than anyone else it seems to me should be most thoroughly conversant with every agency that enters the everyday lives of all our fellow citizens or of the greater part of them we should be familiar with the beginnings and the backgrounds of these agencies with their present operations and standards and with their aspirations and outlooks for the future thus onlyarmed with such knowledge can we legislate and advise properly for the benefit of all thus only can we give proper encouragement and aid to those agenciesand there are many of them which are operating for the public welfare and making for the comfort and happiness of americans our nation is what it is i think because it has so many capable agencies working for its people in the fastmoving march of events in this fastmoving country we are too apt it seems to me to accept without much thought and sometimes with no gratitude whatever the accommodations the conveniences the luxuries which are so readily accessible to all of us they seem commonplace they are part of us they are inextricably woven into the fabric of our society yet we would seem totally lost were we to be deprived of any of these things which have become so familiar we accept as an everyday thinggetting along in some mysterious way which we do not stop to reason out our great postal system the vastest distribution agency in the world and one of the greatest services to the nation we overlook in our casual acceptance the fact that men operate the postal systemmen impelled by motives of genuine service for we all know that their material rewards are far from great we accept again our splendid transportation systemsour steam and electric railroads our fastgrowing automotive lines our ocean and river vessels truly enough these are commercial enterprises operated primarily with the idea of gain of moneymaking but they can not profit and none of them ever will unless they render service and unless those who guide them have that impelling motive and so with our unsurpassed communication systemsour telegraph and telephone and radio channels for the dissemination of information and educationand so with our great newspapers and magazines back of each of these instruments of enlightenment is of course the definite demand of commerce that they must be operated profitably that they must make money but implanted just as strongly as that idea in the minds of those who operate them is the idea that they must 1388 serve that they are necessltles that the people could not do can not occasionally if not regularly pay thesmall fee which gains without them they have responsibilities to the people they him admittance to the motionpicture house added to these basic realize those responsibilities and accept them they carry out advantages there is another and perhaps a dominating factor motion those responsibilities with the best of their sincerity and skill pictures combine at least some of the attractiveness of all the older and soand only sothey sucaeed diversions of mankind it is my wish with your permission to review here today for example travel in a comfortable seat near his own home another great agency which within our own lifetimes has warm in winter and cool in summer the movie patron has the whole conie to be a very vital part of the americans existence the world brought before his eyes not only by means of the news reel but motion picture we accept our movies as they are affec also through the many photoplays which have their scenes laid in stionately called just as we accept our mail service our rail foreign lands his love of the hunt is satisfied by means of pictures roads and street cars our telephones and newspapers they taken in the wilds showing the savage beasts in their native environare part of us the people of this country have made them ments as for sport he sees reproduction of the great spectacles of their favorite form of diversion and indeed for countless old in many of the entertainment pictures while the current sporting millions they are the only form of diversion we do not know events whether a world series baseball game or a championship tennis how we could get along without them yet it is very little that match in france are brought to him by the news reel any of us know about the history the growth the present the motion picture chooses the very best from literature and the magnitude and the future possibilities of the motion picture drama both the classics and the material of the moment for its perhaps that is because of the quick upcoming of the thing screen presentations from the works of the old masters down to and its amazingly wide and sudden spread not only through those of the most popular novelists and playrights of today nearly out our own country but throughout the world it is indeed everything beneficial and entertaining has been and is being picturized only 30 years since the first pictures were shown in a theater and so the picture patron is not only being entertained but educated by in new york city at the end of a commonplace variety literature and the drama as he sits in his cheap easy seat at his show as they were called in those days favorite picture house there he also enjoys with each performance i must confess myself astounded at the information i gained one of mankinds greatest plbasures good music during a recent study of motion pictures and of the motion there should be no mystery or wonderment about the reason for the picture industry which from the standpoint of magnitude great popularity and s ess of the motion picture the answer as alone ranks well to the front among the very greatest of you see is very simple american enterprises it is indeed the most distinctive of all american enterprises the rapidity of the growth and development of the motionin a fashion for it supplies to the whole world a greater per picture industry is the most surprising thing about it and i centage of its product than any other american industry does think credit for that is due to the manner in which it has been of any other product from the department of commerce i regulatedselfregulated if you willby those who have conhave these figures trolled it particularly within the past few years of the worlds per cent let us look briefly at the motionpictures history the

than 80 it today motion pictures we produce more than 85 in 1888 thomas a edison made practical a camera capable it is astonishing again to learn that there are 175 000 of our of taking a great number of photographs in rapid succession fellow americans regularly employed in the production dis but he had no suitable substance upon which images obtained tribution and exhibition of motion pictures by his lenses could be recorded he perfected a camera nothwe all know that motion pictures are popular but we do ing more not all realize perhaps that they are the most popular form in the same year george eastman unknown to mr edison of amusement the world has ever known in all its history perfected a flexible ribbon of celluloid coated with sensitive there must be certain definite reasons for the tremendous emulsion this was for use in his famous kodak camera which popularity of this new and young form of amusement there took pictures of the type we now call stills mr eastman are psychologists and sociologists are able to explain these knew nothing of motion pictures and had no interest in them reasons readily enough here is their explanation he did not even know that mr edison was working on a recreation and diversion from the ordinary routine of life is one camera to take them but news of the celluloid ribbon in some of the absolute necessities of mankind if relaxation is not provided way came from rochester n y to the edison laboratory in in the form of beneficial or at least wholesome entertainment there menlo park n j the two men got together the combination will be irritability abnormal fatigue or antisocial outbreaks in the of inventions was found to harmonize and then and there was early days of savagery man had ample diversion in providing himself the beginning of this great industry which now carries the name with food and in escaping from the wild beasts and his enemies in of america to the ends of the earth order merely to live but as time went on and the gaining of a liveli little importance was attached to motion pictures at that hood became more simplified he had leisure time to himself and then time they were a noveltya sort of toyand one person at there arose the necessity of occupying at least part of this time with a time looked at them through an aperture in a box after pleasant diversions having dropped in a coin it was eight years later in 1896 mans first pastime probably was the hunt the thrill of this re as i have said before when motion pictures were first premaining with him even after the necessity of it had vanished the sented in a theater as a form of entertainment as such they dance which was originally part of his religious ceremonies was are 30 years old this year and the industry is celebrating another early form of diversion this like the hunt we still have their thirtieth birthday these first pictures were merely with us contests of skill and speed such as the olympic games also little flashes of actiona dancera chorus from a musical originated in a semireligious way since they were inaugurated as part comedy and some waves breaking on the shore they told no of the funeral services in honor of ancient greek warriors story and there was no drama about them they were simply travel was always a diversion for mankind but it was and still pictures that movedalthough even they seemed miraculous remains within the reach of a comparative few and not of the majority in those days from very early days man has been diverted by the drama but there these first pictures ran for little more than one minute again is an instrument of entertainment which is not within the reach apiece and were registered on about 40 feet of film or the means of everybody the use of literature as a means of enter the first attempt at dramaat a real photoplaywas not tainment was extremely limited in mans early days because the hand made until 1903 when a wild melodrama called the great written manuscripts were possessed only by the rich and the scholars train robbery which was 800 feet long and ran about eight literature as we know it in the form of the printed book is less than minutes was presented 500 years old since type was not invented until 1450 even now in the early 1900s the first motionpicture houses were not everybody cares for reading nor in spite of our many public established they were usually vacated stores or abandoned libraries are the best books available for everybody shooting galleries and often the spectators sat on camp stools the great popularity and success of motion pictures therefore is borrowed from the friendly undertaker next door the shows due to several easily traceable causes first they are within the ran about 10 to 15 minutes each and the admission price was reach of all there is scarcely a village scarcely even a neighborhood a nickel which gave rise to the name with which we all used in all civilization without its motionpicture theater at the same to be familiar nickelodeon there was no music at all time the pictures are within the means of all there is no one who at first then the rattletrap piano was introduced chiefly with the idea of marshaling one group of customers out and another group in when we entered such places we went furtively and were more or less ashamed to be seen doing it the motionpicture theaters of today are actually the show places the public monuments so to speak of many of our municipalities and we are all proud of them some of them seat as many as 5 000 persons and even larger ones are under way the masterpieces of drama of history of comedy and tragedy that we see now often run for more than two hours and form a whole evenings entertainment the works of the worlds most famous authors and playwrights are sought for pictures and are made into photodramas that frequently are more interesting anti vivid than the original novels or stage plays we have orchestras numbering as many as 80 musicians educating the public in the finest sort of music and possessed of libraries containing as many as 60 000 different compositions it is true that in the early days the motionpicture business was a game a circus a flybynight sort of thing conducted in a helterskelter fashion and with utter disregard of the commonsense methods pursued by older and more established businesses there was money to make in it quick and plentiful moneyand in the haste of getting this there was neither time nor disposition on the part of those who made pictures and those who showed pictures to realize the importance of this new thing that had fallen into their hands indeed such a condition prevailed until very recent years in 1922 the more thoughtful of the motionpicture producers and distributers realizing the unlimited possibilities for good or for evil in this instrument for the transmission of ideas got together and determinedand publicly avowedthat the power of the motion picture great then greater now and inevitably to be still greater as the years go on should be wielded for the good of humanity nine producing and distributing corporations banded themselves together under the title of the motion picture producers and distributors of america inc and in their articles of incorporation they set forth their purposes as follows establishing and maintaining the highest possible moral and artistic standards of motion pictures and developing the educational as well as the entertainment value of the motion picture i think it will be agreed that no more worthy ideals could have been set down and that if these ideals were carried out with sincerity the whole world was bound to benefit the first step taken by the men who formed this association was to engage a leader and adviser a man whom they could respect and trust and particularly a man equipped with a knowledge of the real america and of the psychology of his fellow americans they chose a man amply possessed of those qualificationswill h hays a distinguished lawyer a distinguished worker in a number of causes for the betterment of america and at that time postmaster general of the united states on various missions during the greater part of his life mr hays had been up and down and over and across the united states and was as familiar with the residents of tiny hamlets as he was with those of the greater cities it seemed to him that there could be no greater public service than the guiding of the destinies of this instrument the motion picture which has so powerful an influence upon all the people and so after long consideration and with the full approval of president harding of whose cabinet he was a member mr hays accepted the position of president of the motion picture producers and distributors of america inc and of adviser to this whole great industry of motion picture technicalities will hays knew nothing whatever but one basic fact about pictures he did know and this fact has motivated his every action since he took office that fact is this that the motion pictures the beloved movies belong solely to the people and that the motionpicture industry must always be the public servant one of the first steps taken by the association of producers and distributors was to call a conference of the representatives of national social religious welfare and educational bodies to secure their advice and cooperation in achieving the purposes that i have just quoted to you out of that conference the committee on public relations was formed representing through their member organizations many millions of men and women interested in public welfare they proceeded to act as an advisory body to interpret the desires of the public in relation to the motionpicture entertainments and to develop pictures to a higher plane through a systematic plan of supporting the best productions it was evident that if the commendable pictures were successful from a business point of view more of the same quality would be produced about 60 national organizations came together in the summer of 1922 to form the committee on public relations here are the names of some of

within the motion picture producers and distributors of america inc with power and personnel to carry on the increasing work this proposal was made by the committee to mr hays and his associates who acquiesced and the department of public relations was established to serve as the industrys official means of continuing and further developing public cooperation as initiated by the publicrelations

through the congress i challenge the proposed bill on the following grounds 1 it is an attempt by the state of california to gain special privileges and advantages in the development of the greatest resource in the southwest at the expense and in jeopardy of the rights of other states in the colorado river basin equally interested and having in all respects equal and in material respects superior rightsin that great river 2 the plan of development proposed in the bill is misrepresented as primarily a flood control and reclamation measure whereas it is in fact primarily a gigantic government power project masquerading in the more appealing clothing of flood control and needed water for irrigation and domestic uses 3 the bill proposes a departure from the sound wellestablished and traditional policy of the united states government in respect to the entrance of the government into business in thata it provides for government entrance into the power business and puts the government directly into this great industry on a gigantic scale thus departing from the national policy established by the federal water power act b it reverses and violates the wellconsidered and sound policy expressed by secretaries weeks work and wallace as members of the federal power commission in their study and report on this project written march 24 1924 and attached hereto 4 the plan proposed ignores the recommendation of leading government engineers of the united states geological survey war department and federal power commission for the proper economical development of the colorado river and follows a plan proposed by engineers now and formerly connected with the united states reclamation service 5 the plan proposed is uneconomic and extravagant and wholly unnecessary for the meeting of the primary needs involved 6 the plan represents a political solution of an economic and engineering problem of the first magnitude vital to a great section of our countrya plan supported by intense and cleverly directed propaganda which has stifled criticism and secured results through political pressure the cfolorado river is north americas most wonderful stream from its headwaters to its mouth it drops almost 8 000 feet the beauty and grandeur of its canyons are not equaled by any other river in the world electrical engineers tell us that it is capable of generating nearly 8 000 000 horsepower of electric energy the average annual runoff of the river is between sixteen and eighteen million acrefeet the economic future of seven states is more or less dependent upon the development of this great river and the protection of their equitable rights in such development the basin of the colorado river because of its physical characteristics is divided into two divisions known as the lower and upper basin the states of arizona california and nevada are designated as lowerbasin states while colorado new mexico utah and wyoming are known as the upperbasin states all of the states in the entire basin except perhaps california are what are known as priorappropriation states because of controversies that were sure to arise in the future development of the river the several states of the basin through their legal representatives entered into a compact or treaty known as the colorado river compact this instrunent was executed at santa fe n mex on the 24th day of november 1922 and was signed by the representatives of the several states and secretary hoover who had much to do with directing the deliberations of the framers of the instrument this compact seeks by treaty by and between the states in the colorado river basin to allocate the water of the river to the two basins under the terms of this instrument there was allocated to the upper and lower basin states respectively the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7 500 000 acrefeet of water per annum and the lowerbasin group were given the right to increase the beneficial consumptive use of the waters of the river by 1 000 000 acrefeet per annum it is to be noted that no attempt was made to allocate water to the individual states but the states in each basin were left to distribute the amount allocated to the particular basin among themselves all of the states in the basin except arizona ratified the socalled sevenstate compact the main purpose of the compact was to modify the law of prior appropriation so that economic development could go forward in the lower basin without creating priorities against the upperbasin states it is conceded that the necessity for immediate development in the lower basin is more urgent than in the upper by the terms of the compact the upper basin was guaranteed 7 500 000 acrefeet of water for future development a controversy soon arose between arizona and california with reference to the division of the waters allocated to the lower basin as a result of this controversy it was proposed that all of the states in the basin except arizona accept and ratify the socalled sevenstate compact and waive the ratification by arizona this proposal has been known and designated as the sixstate compact such an agreement of course would not bind arizona and she would be free in the future to apply the unappropriated water of the river to beneficial use and thereby create a priority against each of the other states in the basin it is therefore apparent that complete protection under the terms of the colorado river compact can not be had except by the ratification of this instrument by all of the seven states the upperbasin states have at all times desired to see development go forward on the colorado river so long as their equitable rights to future development were protected utah was led to believe and did believe that california following the ratification of the sixstate compact by the upper states would also ratify this compact without condition the people of utah realized that they were assuming some risk by their action but were unwilling to do so believing that california would assume the same risk and no greater however at a very early date the legislature of the state of california passed the following resolution"]]}
