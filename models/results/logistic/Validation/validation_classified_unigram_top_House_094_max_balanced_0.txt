career or diminish the legislative impact he has had on international affairs i know i watched him in action through his entire service in the house he is one of the most energetic and conscientious congressmen i have ever known otto always tackled his congressional duties and the problems faced by his constituents with a refreshing fervor he never lost his enthusiasm when otto came to congress to represent louisianas fifth congressional district a mostly rural area in the northeastern corner of the state he called himself a country boy i of course representing new orleans the largest city in the state was a city slicker but otto and i became fast friends we scaled the seniority ladder together and eventually i became dean of the louisiana delegation and otto vice dean he has always been a tremendous help to me in coordinating the delegations efforts for our state as otto leaves the congress he ranks 15th in seniority in the house out of 435 members and is fourth on the appropriations committee and chairman of its foreign operations subcommittee chairman of that subcommittee since 1955 after being in congress only 8 years otto passman tackled the job vigorously and took stands on foreign assistance which were at times unpopular but he had a genuine concern about the amount of money the united states was spending abroad on countries which turned around and used the money in antiamerican endeavors he has always been critical of deficit spending and we were spending more money than we took in because of the big monetary gifts going to foreign governments otto accepted the responsibility which this subcommittee entailed and became an expert on foreign assistance made tough decisions and let the chips fall where they may it can be documented that otto passman saved the taxpayers billions of dollars while he was chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee that in itself is a great accomplishment and something for which the american people should be grateful otto passman indeed changed the course of foreign aid and set our foreign assistance ship on steadier waters for this he has earned his niche in the history books while responsible for duties of international importance otto never overlooked his constituents or the state of louisiana he helped his district obtain millions of federal dollars for various programs and his service to constituents with problems no matter how big or small always had a personal touch he was a true representative of his people reflecting their views on legislation and providing them with a powerful national voice like me he believes in representative government and he cast many tough votes which went against the grain of the national party but was the position of the majority of the people who sent him here as their representative in my book that is what representative government is all about i am going to miss otto passman i think this house will miss him too he is colorful courageous

he wanted to assure that there would not be any efforts to confiscate handguns from lawabiding citizens and things like that which is a position that i support but it seems to me that what the
